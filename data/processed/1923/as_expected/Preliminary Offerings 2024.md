**Prohibition of Sales to EEA Retail Investors: The securities described in the preliminary offering**
memorandum are not intended to be offered, sold, distributed or otherwise made available to and should
not be offered, sold, distributed or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the European
Economic Area (the “EEA”). For purposes of this provision, the expression retail investor means a
person who is one (or more) of the following: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1)
of Markets in Financial Instruments Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID II”); (ii) a customer
within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97 (as amended, the “Insurance Mediation Directive”),
where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1)
of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (as amended, the
“Prospectus Regulation”). Consequently, no key information document required by Regulation (EU)
No 1286/2014 (as amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering, selling or distributing the securities
or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore
offering, selling or distributing the securities or otherwise making them available to any retail investor
in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation.

The preliminary offering memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the securities
referred to therein in any Member State of the EEA will be made pursuant to an exemption under the
Prospectus Regulation from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of the securities referred
to therein. Accordingly, any person making or intending to make an offer in a Member State of securities
which are the subject of the offering contemplated in the preliminary offering memorandum may only
do so in circumstances in which no obligation arises for the issuer or any of the initial purchasers to
publish a prospectus pursuant to Article 3 of the Prospectus Regulation, in each case, in relation to such
offer. Neither the issuer nor the initial purchasers have authorized, nor do they authorize, the making of
any offer of securities in circumstances in which an obligation arises for the issuer or the initial
purchasers to publish a prospectus for such offer.

**EU MIFIR product governance / Professional investors and ECPs only target market: Solely for**
**the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in**
**respect of the securities has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the securities is eligible**


-----

counterparties and professional clients only, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all channels for
distribution of the securities to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any
person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the securities (a “distributor”) should take into
consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II
is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the securities (by either
adopting or refining the manufacturers target market assessment) and determining appropriate
distribution channels.

**Prohibition of Sales to UK Retail Investors: The notes described in the preliminary offering**
memorandum are not intended to be offered, sold, distributed or otherwise made available to and should
not be offered, sold, distributed or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the United
Kingdom (“UK”). For the purposes of this provision, a retail investor means a person who is one (or
more) of the following: (i) a retail client as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No
2017/565 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (as
amended, “EUWA”); or (ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of FSMA (as defined
below) and any rules or regulations made under FSMA to implement the Insurance Mediation Directive,
where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of
Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; or (iii) not a
qualified investor as defined in the UK Prospectus Regulation. Consequently, no key information
document required by the PRIIPs Regulation as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA
(the “UK PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering, selling or distributing the notes or otherwise making them
available to retail investors in the UK has been prepared and therefore offering, selling or distributing
the notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the UK may be unlawful under
the UK PRIIPs Regulation.

The preliminary offering memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the notes
referred to therein in the UK will be made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Regulation
as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the “UK Prospectus Regulation”) from the
requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of the securities referred to therein. Accordingly, any
person making or intending to make an offer in the UK of notes which are the subject of the offering
contemplated in the preliminary offering memorandum may only do so in circumstances in which no
obligation arises for the issuer or any of the initial purchasers to publish a prospectus pursuant to Article
3 of the UK Prospectus Regulation, in each case, in relation to such offer. Neither the issuer nor the
initial purchasers have authorized, nor do they authorize, the making of any offer of notes in
circumstances in which an obligation arises for the issuer or any of the initial purchasers to publish a
prospectus for such offer.

**UK MIFIR product governance / Professional investors and ECPs only target market: Solely for**
the purposes of the product approval process of any relevant initial purchaser that considers itself a
manufacturer pursuant to the FCA Handbook Product Intervention and Product Governance
Sourcebook (the “UK MiFIR Product Governance Rules”) (each a “UK Manufacturer” and,
together, the “UK Manufacturers”), the target market assessment in respect of the notes has led to the
conclusion that: (i) the target market for the notes is only eligible counterparties, as defined in the FCA
Handbook Conduct of Business Sourcebook (“COBS”), and professional clients, as defined in
Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the European Union
(Withdrawal) Act 2018 (“UK MiFIR”); and (ii) all channels for distribution of the notes to eligible
counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or
recommending the notes (a “UK distributor”) should take into consideration the UK Manufacturers’
target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to the UK MiFIR Product Governance Rules
is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the notes (by either
adopting or refining the UK Manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate
distribution channels.

The attached preliminary offering memorandum is for distribution only to (i) persons who have
professional experience in matters relating to investments and who qualify as investment professionals

**NOTICE TO INVESTORS IN THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA**

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered,
sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the EEA. For these purposes, a retail investor
means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of
MiFID II; or (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97 (as amended, the “Insurance
**Distribution Directive”), where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in**
point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Regulation (EU)
2017/1129 (as amended, the “Prospectus Regulation”). Consequently, no key information document
required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended or superseded, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for
offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been
prepared and therefore offering or selling such Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail

Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment
in respect of the Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is eligible
counterparties and professional clients only, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all channels for
distribution of the Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person
subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Notes (a “distributor”) should take into
consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II
is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either
adopting or refining the manufacturers target market assessment) and determining appropriate
distribution channels.

**INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA**

In this offering memorandum, we rely on and refer to information regarding our business and the
markets in which we operate and compete. Unless otherwise indicated, we have generally obtained all
information regarding market, market size, growth rate, development, trends and competitive position
and other industry data pertaining to our business contained in this offering memorandum from industry
publications, surveys or studies conducted by third-party sources, including the sources mentioned in
“Industry Overview,” internal surveys and estimates and publicly available information. All of the
information set forth in this offering memorandum relating to the operations, financial results or market
share of our competitors has been obtained from information made available to the public in such
companies’ publicly available reports and independent research, as well as from our experience,
estimates and investigation of market conditions.

Industry and consultant publications and forecasts generally state that the information they contain has
been obtained from sources believed to be reliable, but that the accuracy and completeness of such
information is not guaranteed. While we believe that each of the studies and publications we have used
is reliable, neither we nor the initial purchasers have independently verified the data that were extracted
or derived from these industry and consultant publications or reports and cannot guarantee their
accuracy or completeness. Market data and statistics are inherently uncertain and not necessarily
reflective of actual market conditions. Such statistics are based on market research, which itself is based
on sampling and subjective judgments by both the researchers and the respondents, including judgments
about what types of products and transactions should be included in the relevant market.

As we operate in a number of different markets, it is difficult to obtain precise or current industry and
market information, which makes the available industry and market information incomplete or noncomparable. In those cases where there was no readily available or reliable external information to
validate market-related analyses or estimates or the data conflicted with other data or was noncomparable or internally inconsistent, statements regarding the industries in which we operate and our
position in these industries are based solely on our experience and estimates and our own investigation
of market conditions. We cannot assure you that any of these estimates are accurate or correctly reflect
our position in the industry and none of our internal surveys and estimates have or has been verified by
any independent sources.

While we are not aware of any misstatements regarding the industry or similar data presented herein,
such data involve risks and uncertainties and are subject to change based on various factors, including
those discussed under “Risk Factors.” As far as we are aware and have been able to ascertain from

vi


-----

information published by such third parties, no facts have been omitted that would render the
reproduced information inaccurate or misleading. Neither we nor the initial purchasers, however, make
any representation as to the accuracy or completeness of any such information in this offering
memorandum. Moreover, none of the sources mentioned herein have assumed responsibility for any
information included in this offering memorandum.

**FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS**

This offering memorandum contains statements under the captions “Summary,” “Risk Factors,”
_“Industry Overview,” “Business,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and_
_Results of Operations” and in other sections that are, or may be deemed to be, forward-looking_
statements. In some cases, these forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of forwardlooking terminology, including the words “aims,” “believes,” “estimates,” “anticipates,” “expects,”
“intends,” “may,” “will,” “plans,” “predicts,” “assumes,” “shall,” “continue” or “should” or, in each
case, their negative or other variations or comparable terminology or by discussions of strategies, plans,
objectives, targets, goals, future events or intentions. By their very nature, all forward-looking
statements involve risk and uncertainty because they relate to future events and circumstances that are
beyond our control, including but not limited to those below. As a result, our actual future financial
condition, performance and results may differ materially from the plans, goals and expectations set out
in any forward-looking statements made by us.

Many factors may cause our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and the development of
the industries in which we operate to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forwardlooking statements contained in this offering memorandum. These factors include, among others:

- the impact of a decline in the economic conditions in the United Kingdom or globally and by
other market risks;

- volatility or declines in the premiums on which our commissions are based and declines in
commission rates;

- the ability to fully realize our commercial and strategic vision;

- the impact of our selective acquisition and disposal strategy;

- risks related to the Retail Transaction;

- entry into new geographies and markets;

- our ability to retain our key personnel;

- our dependence on technology-based solutions to drive value for our clients, gain internal
efficiencies and implement effective internal controls;

- interruption or loss of our information processing systems or failure to maintain secure
information systems and technological changes;

- the ability to successfully implement various IT initiatives;

- our dependence on insurance companies and other capacity and product providers that give us
underwriting capacity to distribute our products;

- risks relating to unaudited pro forma financial information presented herein;

- the potential for impairments of intangible assets;

- the impact of competition;

- damage to our business reputation;

- new expectations from investors, customers or employees on environmental, social and
governance matters;

viii


-----

- our exposure to potential regulatory sanctions and fines;

- the impact of privacy and data protection regulation;

- our exposure to regulatory, economic and business risks associated with maintaining offices
abroad;

- legislative, taxation and regulatory changes, inquiries or enforcement actions, affecting our
ability to operate or the profit generated from our activities;

- our exposure to potential liabilities arising from errors and omissions claims against us;

- our dependence on various proprietary technologies and the protection of our intellectual
property for our continued success;

- the ability to comply with regulations and guidelines and our risks and compliance framework;

- application of risk and compliance framework across segments;

- unexpected payments to any pension plans;

- liquidity risk;

- limited operating flexibility due to financial and restrictive covenants in our debt agreements;

- our ability to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness;

- our ability to implement hedges effectively;

- risks related to interest costs and reduction of cash flow;

- risks related to our substantial leverage;

- risks related to our capital structure, the Notes, the Note Guarantees and other indebtedness;

- financial covenants; and

- the other factors discussed or referred to in this offering memorandum.

These risks and others described under “Risk Factors” are not exhaustive. Other sections of this offering
memorandum describe additional factors that could adversely affect our results of operations, financial
condition, liquidity and the development of the industries in which we operate. New risks can emerge
from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all such risks, nor can we assess the impact of
all such risks on our business or the extent to which any risks, or combination of risks and other factors,
may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.
Given these risks and uncertainties, you should not rely on forward-looking statements as a prediction
of actual results.

Any forward-looking statements are only made as of the date of this offering memorandum, and we do
not intend, and do not assume any obligation, to update forward-looking statements set forth in this
offering memorandum. You should interpret all subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements
attributable to us or to persons acting on our behalf as being qualified by the cautionary statements in
this offering memorandum. As a result, you should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking
statements.

**PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION**

**The Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Company**

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer is a finance company that was formed on February 1, 2024 for the

engage in any activities other than those related to its formation, the Transactions and other future

material assets and liabilities will be its outstanding indebtedness under the Senior Secured Notes, the

The Company is a holding company and will be a Guarantor of the Senior Secured Notes. It is the top

subsidiaries, including the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, its liabilities under the Senior Secured Proceeds
Loan and certain intercompany balances, and any future indebtedness, assets or other liabilities that
arise as a result of transactions not prohibited by the Senior Secured Indenture. We do not present any
financial information or financial statements of the Company in this offering memorandum.

**The Senior Notes Issuer and the Parent**

The Senior Notes Issuer is a finance company that was formed on February 1, 2024 for the purpose of
the Transactions and other potential transactions and is not expected to engage in any activities other
than those related to its formation, the Transactions and other future transactions permitted by the Senior
Indenture. The Senior Notes Issuer’s only material assets and liabilities will be its outstanding
indebtedness under the Senior Notes, the receivable under the Senior Proceeds Loan, any other future
indebtedness and certain intercompany balances, and any other assets or liabilities that arise as a result
of transactions not prohibited by the Senior Indenture. We do not present any financial information or
financial statements of the Senior Notes Issuer in this offering memorandum.

The Parent is a holding company and will be a Guarantor of the Senior Notes. It is the top entity in the
restricted group under the Senior Indenture and the direct parent of the Senior Notes Issuer. The Parent’s
only material assets and liabilities are its interest in the Company and the Senior Notes Issuer, its
liabilities under the Proceeds Loan and certain intercompany balances, and any future indebtedness,
assets or other liabilities that arise as a result of transactions not prohibited by the Senior Indenture. No
financial information for or financial information of the Parent is presented for any period after
December 31, 2022.

**Financial Statements**

In this offering memorandum, we include the historical consolidated financial information for (a) the
Parent, which is the direct parent of the Senior Notes Issuer and (b) Ardonagh Group Holdings Limited
(“AGHL”), the reporting entity of the Group. See “—Comparability of the Financial statements—The
_Tara Transactions.”_

We present the following historical consolidated financial information in this offering memorandum:

- the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements of AGHL as of and for the
nine months ended September 30, 2023, including the comparative information for the period
ended September 30, 2022 and notes thereto (the “Unaudited Interim Financial
**Statements”), which have been prepared in accordance with the International Accounting**
Standard 34 Interim Financial Reporting (“IAS 34”);

x


-----

- the audited consolidated financial statements of the Parent as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2022, including the notes thereto, which have been audited by Deloitte LLP (the
“2022 Audited Financial Statements”) and have been prepared in accordance with
International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the United Kingdom (“IFRS”); and

- the audited consolidated financial statements of the Parent as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2021, including the comparative information as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2020 and the notes thereto, which have been audited by Deloitte LLP (the “2021
**Audited Financial Statements”, together with the 2022 Audited Financial Statements, the**
“Audited Financial Statements” and together with the Unaudited Interim Financial
Statements, the “Financial Statements”) and have been prepared in accordance with IFRS.

In the 2022 Audited Financial Statements, we restated the line items for trade and other receivables and
retained losses in the consolidated statement of financial position of the Parent as of December 31,
2021, and therefore present such information as extracted from the comparative column therein.

Unless the context otherwise requires, all references herein to “we,” “our,” “us,” “Group” and
“Ardonagh” with respect to any financial information in this offering memorandum are to (i) the Parent
and its consolidated subsidiaries for any period ended on or prior to December 31, 2022 and (ii) AGHL
and its consolidated subsidiaries for the period ended September 30, 2022 and any period after
December 31, 2022.

The financial information included in this offering memorandum is not intended to comply with the
SEC’s reporting requirements.

**_Differences in the Financial Statements of AGHL and the Parent_**

We have accounted for the Tara Transactions using the acquisition method of accounting under IFRS
3, Business Combinations, applying purchase accounting adjustments that resulted, among others, in
the recognition of intangibles (including goodwill) and deferred tax liabilities in our financial
information. Due to the application of the acquisition method of accounting, the Unaudited Interim
Financial Statements of AGHL are not directly comparable to the Audited Financial Statements of the
Parent.

The key differences between the net assets in the consolidated statements of financial position of AGHL
and the Parent as of September 30, 2023 relate to (i) intangible assets and (ii) assets held for sale with
respect to the Retail platform. The financial information for the Parent as of and for the nine months
ended September 30, 2023 is not included in this offering memorandum. With respect to intangible
assets, AGHL has higher intangible assets of £2,401.9 million compared to the Parent, due to the
revaluation of assets and liabilities in accordance with IFRS 3 upon acquisition of the Parent by AGHL.
To acquire the Parent, AGHL issued ordinary shares and hence increased its share capital and share
premium balances. AGHL also has higher non-current liabilities, specifically deferred tax liabilities of
£104.0 million. With respect to held for sale assets, AGHL has higher held for sale assets of £746.3
million compared to the Parent as the result of the revaluation of the intangible assets of the Retail
platform in accordance with IFRS 3 upon acquisition of the Parent by AGHL. Similarly, AGHL also
has higher held for sale liabilities of £65.6 million for associated deferred tax liabilities. Additionally,
AGHL has increased borrowings of £41.5 million in non-current liabilities because capitalized
transaction costs are no longer recognized as a reduction in the liability due to the application of
purchase price accounting.

The current assets (excluding cash) of the Parent are £3.3 million higher than those of AGHL, the
current liabilities of the Parent are £7.7 million lower than AGHL’s and the non-current liabilities of
the Parent are £7.9 million lower than AGHL’s as a result of transactions of the parent entities of the
Parent, up to and including AGHL. Cash and cash equivalents for continuing operations are the same
for both AGHL and the Parent.

xi


-----

The consolidated statements of profit and loss and other comprehensive income of AGHL and the Parent
for the nine months ended 2023 differ in that, relative to the Parent, AGHL has (i) higher amortisation
of intangibles £(32.5) million, (ii) lower finance costs due to the debt fair value adjustments £(23.0)
million and (iii) higher commissions and fees (due to hedge reserves written off on the formation of
AGHL) £(4.8) million. Other immaterial differences relate primarily to IFRS fair value adjustments and
certain operating costs of £3.1 million. AGHL has higher Reported EBITDA of £1.7 million and
Adjusted EBITDA of £3.9 million compared to the Parent, primarily due to hedge reserves written off
on the formation of AGHL less costs held in the intermediary companies between AGHL and the Parent.

The Retail platform is shown as a discontinued operation until completion of the disposal and its
financial performance is excluded entirely from the profit from continuing operations in the financial
information of both AGHL and the Parent for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The Retail
platform assets and liabilities are included as held for sale until completion of the disposal in the
consolidated statements of financial position of both AGHL and the Parent as of September 30, 2023.

**_Comparability of the Financial Statements_**

_Historic Acquisitions and Disposals_

We have a long-term track record and well-established process for identifying, executing, and
integrating highly accretive acquisitions across many geographies. We have completed or entered into
acquisition agreements for more than 150 acquisitions since our establishment in 2017. We have also
completed or entered into agreements for four disposals during the periods under review. See “—
_Significant Factors Affecting Results of Operations—Acquisitions and Disposals” and note 11 to the_
Unaudited Interim Financial Statements and note 14 to the 2022 Audited Financial Statements and note
16 to the 2021 Audited Financial Statements for a description of the acquisitions and disposals
completed during the periods under review. As a result, our financial statements may not be fully
comparable between periods.

As a general matter, following an acquisition of a business or group of assets, our results of operations
are impacted by the results of the newly acquired business or operations, the purchase accounting for
the acquisition, any debt incurred to acquire the business or operations and expenditures made to
integrate the newly acquired business or operations which also affects the comparability of our results
with the previous period. In addition to increasing our income through increasing our commission and
fees, we incur certain costs and expenses in connection with any potential or completed acquisition.

_The Retail Transaction_

In September 2023, we announced the merger and disposal of the business carried on by Atlanta
Investments Holdings 3 Limited and its subsidiaries (the “Retail Business”) with Markerstudy Group
Limited (the “Retail Purchaser”), with our shareholders maintaining a minority stake in the combined
business. The transaction values the Retail Business at £1.2 billion. The sale of the entire issued share
capital of Atlanta Investments Holdings 3 Limited to the Retail Purchaser in consideration for cash and
new shares in Venus Topco Limited (the “Retail Transaction”) is subject to the terms of the sale and
purchase agreement in relation to Atlanta Investments Holdings 3 Limited among Nevada Investments
Topco Limited (the “Retail Seller”), the Retail Purchaser, Ardonagh Rocket Investment Holdings
Limited, Tara Topco Limited and Venus Topco Limited dated 15 September 2023 (the “Retail SPA”).
The Retail Transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals. As a result
of this merger and the resulting disposal of the Retail platform, in our Unaudited Interim Financial
Statements, we have presented Retail as held for sale on our consolidated statement of financial position
as of September 30, 2023 and as a discontinued operation on our consolidated statement of profit or
loss and other comprehensive income for the nine months period ended September 30, 2023 and the
period ended September 30, 2022. We have not restated or represented any other financial information
as of or for any other period for the impact of the Retail Transaction. See “Summary—Recent
_Developments—Retail Transaction” and notes 1 and 26 to the Unaudited Interim Financial Statements._

-----

_The Tara Transactions_

In December 2021, we announced a significant new equity investment whereby our two anchor
investors, Madison Dearborn Partners and HPS Investment Partners, agreed to invest capital through
new funds as part of an equity investment of over $1 billion. These investments, made through certain
co-investments by large global institutions through accounts managed by Madison Dearborn Partners
and HPS Investment Partners, increased our Sponsor’s shareholdings and funded minority buy-outs.
Following completion of this transaction (the “Tara Transactions”), the corporate structure of the
Group changed. On May 31, 2022, The Ardonagh Group Limited, the entity at which we previously
reported our results, merged into the Group’s new indirect parent company, Tara Topco Limited.
Following this merger, on June 1, 2022, AGHL acquired Ardonagh New Midco 3 Limited, including
the Group companies that were previously owned by The Ardonagh Group Limited, and became the
reporting entity for the Group. AGHL’s first reporting period included all transactions since its
incorporation on December 8, 2021 to December 31, 2022. The nine-month period ended September
30, 2022, however, only includes four months of the results of operations and cash flows of the
consolidated operations of AGHL due to the timing of the Tara Transactions. Accordingly, AGHL’s
results during any period ended in 2022 are not comparable to any other period presented.

We have accounted for the Tara Transactions using the acquisition method of accounting under IFRS
3, Business Combinations, applying purchase accounting adjustments that resulted, among others, in
the recognition of intangibles (including goodwill) and deferred tax liabilities in our financial
information. Due to the application of the acquisition method of accounting, the Unaudited Interim
Financial Statements of AGHL are not directly comparable to the Audited Financial Statements of the
Parent. See “—Differences in the Financial Statements of AGHL and the Parent” above.

**_Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information_**

In this offering memorandum, we also present certain unaudited financial information prepared by
management to give pro forma effect to:

(a) acquisitions completed on or prior to September 30, 2023 and financing transactions, in each
case, as if they had occurred on October 1, 2022, which is referred to as “Pro Forma for
**Completed Transactions”;**

**_As Adjusted Financial Information_**

This offering memorandum includes certain unaudited financial information on an as adjusted basis to
give effect to the Transactions and the Retail Transaction, and the application of the proceeds therefrom,

on September 30, 2023 and on our interest expense as if such transactions had occurred on October 1,
2022. The as adjusted financial information has been prepared for illustrative purposes only and does
not represent what our cash and cash equivalents, debt and capitalization would have been had such
transactions occurred on September 30, 2023, or what our interest expense would have been had such
transactions occurred on October 1, 2022, nor does it purport to project our cash and cash equivalents,
debt, capitalization or interest expense at any future date. The as adjusted financial information has not
been prepared in accordance with IFRS. Neither the assumptions underlying such adjustments nor the
resulting as adjusted financial information have been audited or reviewed in accordance with any

not required by, or presented in accordance with, IFRS. Our non-IFRS measures are defined by us as
set out below.

We define “Adjusted EBITDA” as Reported EBITDA after adding back management reconciling items.
See “Summary Historical Financial Information and Other Data—Other Consolidated Financial and
_Pro Forma Data.” We also present Adjusted EBITDA by reporting segment._

We define “Adjusted EBITDA margin” as Adjusted EBITDA divided by Total Income expressed as a

We define “Adjusted EBITDA Pro Forma for Q4 Growth and Transactions” as Adjusted EBITDA
Pro Forma for Completed Transactions adjusted for Pro Forma for Q4 2023 Growth and Transactions.

We define “Adjusted EBITDA Pro Forma for Completed Transactions” as Adjusted EBITDA
adjusted for Pro Forma for Completed Transactions.

We define “Available Cash” as our total cash and cash equivalents including Retail and excluding
fiduciary funds and restricted cash. Fiduciary cash consists of client money and insurer money in respect

capital adequacy requirements imposed by the FCA.

We define “capital expenditures” as purchase of intangible fixed assets and purchase of property, plant

those new joiners during that period), (ii) business transformation costs (realizing synergy benefits from
acquired businesses by reorganizing management and business structures and by implementing new
systems and processes, in reorganizing group structures, in transforming business processes, in
terminating contractual arrangements, and in driving a cost base that is the right size for the Group) and
(iii) project capital expenditures (excluding maintenance capital expenditures and purchases of renewal
rights).

We define “management operating cash flow” as Adjusted EBITDA less business working capital
movement (including movements in net insurer balances, pre-payments, accrued income, other debtors,
accruals, deferred income, accounts payable, certain other creditors and provisions, excluding any
balances relating to management reconciling items, financing and corporation tax) and maintenance
capital expenditure (excluding purchases of renewal rights).

We define “management reconciling items” as transformational hires, business transformation costs,
legacy costs, other costs, regulatory costs, acquisition and financing costs, gain on revaluation of
associate and investments and profit on disposal of businesses.

& debt purchases, plus drawings under our Revolving Credit Facility, less financing and associated
costs and regulatory costs.

We define “operating cash conversion” as management operating cash flow divided by Adjusted
EBITDA.

We define “organic growth” as growth (expressed as a percentage) in Total Income for the period (the
“current period”) on a constant perimeter basis as of the last day of the previous period (the
“comparative period”) less any income contribution in the current period of the businesses acquired
in the comparative period for the time that corresponds to the time in the comparative period prior to
their respective acquisitions, as compared to (ii) the Total Income for the comparative period. Organic
growth includes organic income growth of businesses acquired in the comparative period. The organic
growth for the twelve months ended September 30, 2023 excludes any contribution of Hemsley Wynne
Furlong.

acquisitions completed during the period and (ii) financing transactions, in each case, as if they had
occurred on the first day of the period.

We define “Pro Forma for Q4 2023 Growth and Transactions” as adjusted to give effect to as Total
Income Pro Forma for Completed Transactions, as adjusted to give effect to (i) all material acquisitions
completed between October 1, 2023 and December 31, 2023, including certain cost and procurement
synergies, and the disposal of AccuRisk following its sale in the fourth quarter of 2023, in each case, as
if they had occurred on October 1, 2022; (ii) organic growth for the three months for the three months
ended December 31, 2023, calculated as the Adjusted EBITDA or revenue contribution, as applicable,
for the three months ended December 12023, less the Adjusted EBITDA or revenue contribution, as
applicable, of the three months ended December 31, 2022, in each case, on a constant perimeter as of
September 30, 2023; and (iii) acquisition synergies and operational efficiencies across the Group.

dividends.

We define “Total Income” as the sum of commission and fees, other income, investment income and
finance income.

We define “Total Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA” as Adjusted EBITDA Pro Forma for Q4 2023 Growth
and Transactions to give effect to: (i) Pro Forma for Completed Transactions (post-December 31, 2023),
(ii) Pro Forma for Transactions under LOI, (iii) maturing producer hires and (iv) capacity strategy
enhancements.

We define “Total Pro Forma Income” as Pro Forma Income Pro Forma for Q4 Growth and
Transactions, as adjusted to give effect to: (i) Pro Forma for Completed Transactions (post-December
31, 2023), (ii) Pro Forma for Transactions under LOI, (iii) maturing producer hires and (iv) capacity

For a detailed description of the adjustments made to Adjusted EBITDA and Total Income, see
“Summary—Summary Historical Financial Information and Other Data—Other Consolidated
_Financial and Pro Forma Data” and See “Summary—Summary Historical Financial Information and_
_Other Data—Other As Adjusted Income Data of Ardonagh Group Holdings Limited.”_

We present these non-IFRS measures because we believe that they are widely used by securities analysts
and other interested parties as supplemental measures of performance and liquidity. The non-IFRS
measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and should not
be considered in isolation or be used as a substitute for an analysis of our operating result as reported
under IFRS. Non-IFRS measures and ratios are not measurements of our performance or liquidity under
IFRS and should not be considered as alternatives to net profit/loss for the period or any other

xvi


-----

performance measures derived in accordance with IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting
principles or as alternatives to cash flow from operating, investing or financing activities. The non-IFRS
measures have limitations as analytical tools. Some of these limitations are:

- they do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or
contractual commitments;

- they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;

- they do not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary, to
service interest or principal payments, on our debts;

- although amortisation and depreciation are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and
amortized will often need to be replaced in the future and certain of these non-IFRS measures
do not reflect any cash requirements that would be required for such replacements;

- they are not adjusted for all non-cash income or expense items that are reflected in our
statements of cash flows;

- they may differ from similarly titled measures presented by other companies;

- some of the exceptional items that we eliminate in calculating Adjusted EBITDA-based
measures, reflect cash payments that were made, or will in the future be made;

- certain Adjusted EBITDA-based measures and Total Income-based measures include entities
that were not owned by the Group during the entire period presented and are based on
preliminary and unaudited information that may not be fully comparable to the information of
the Group;

- certain Adjusted EBITDA-based measures and Total Income-based measures include the
impact of transactions that we expect to completed in the near-term but there may be some
uncertainty around the occurrence or timing of completion; and

- the further adjustments made in calculating Adjusted EBITDA-based measures and Total
Income-based measures are those that management consider are not representative of the
underlying operations of the Ardonagh Group and therefore are subjective in nature.

**_Adjusted EBITDA-Based Measures and Total Income-Based Measures_**

In evaluating Adjusted EBITDA-based measures and Total Income-based measures, you should be
aware that, as an analytical tool, Adjusted EBITDA-based measures and Total Income-based measures
are subject to certain limitations. Adjusted EBITDA-based measures are not a measurement of
performance or liquidity under IFRS and you should not consider Adjusted EBITDA-based measures
as an alternative to (i) profit (as determined in accordance with IFRS) as a measure of our performance,
(ii) cash flow for the period as a measure of our ability to meet our cash needs or (iii) any other measure
of performance or liquidity under IFRS. Total Income-based measures should not be considered as an
alternate to our reported commission and fees and other income. We present Adjusted EBITDA-based
measures and Total Income-based measures as we believe that they are a measure commonly used by
investors and are a measure that we use in managing each of our businesses.

Adjusted EBITDA-based measures and Total Income-based measures are included in this offering
memorandum because we believe that they provide a useful measure of our results of operations;
however, these measures do not constitute measures of financial performance under IFRS and you
should not consider Adjusted EBITDA-based measures or Total Income-based measures as an
alternative to profit, commission and fees or any other performance measure derived in accordance with
IFRS or as a measure of our results of operations or liquidity. Other companies, including those in our

xvii


-----

industry, may calculate similarly titled financial measures differently from us, and therefore such
financial measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.

The Adjusted EBITDA-based measures and Total Income-based measures presented in this offering
memorandum are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties. They do not present our reported results
of operations for the twelve months ended September 30, 2023, and are not comparable to the Financial
Statements or other financial information included elsewhere in this offering memorandum. In addition,
the Adjusted EBITDA-based measures and Total Income-based measures do not purport to indicate our
future consolidated results of operations. Our actual results may differ significantly from those reflected
in these Adjusted EBITDA-based measures and Total Income-based measures. The calculations of
these Adjusted EBITDA-based measures and Total Income-based measures are based on various
assumptions and management estimates, are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties and may not
give an accurate or complete picture of the financial condition or results of operations of any entity prior
to it being acquired by us. The underlying financial information in the Adjusted EBITDA-based
measures and Total Income-based measures may not be prepared on as basis comparable to our
consolidated financial statements or the other financial information included in this offering
memorandum. Accordingly, none of the Adjusted EBITDA-based measures and Total Income-based
measures should be relied upon when making an investment decision. See also “Risk Factors—Risks
_Related to Our Business and Industry—The unaudited pro forma financial information presented herein_
_is inherently subject to risks and uncertainties.”_

For a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA-based measures to our profit or (loss) for the period and for
a reconciliation of Total Income-based measures to Total Income, see “Summary Historical Financial
_Information and Other Data—Other Consolidated Financial and Pro Forma Data.”_

None of the Adjusted EBITDA-based measures used in this offering memorandum are calculated in the
same manner in which “Consolidated EBITDA” may be calculated pursuant to the Indenture governing
the Notes as described under “Description of the Notes” or for purposes of any of our other
indebtedness.

**_LTM Financial Information_**

Financial information of AGHL for the twelve months ended September 30, 2023 presented in this
offering memorandum was calculated by taking the results of operations for the three months ended
December 31, 2022 and adding it to the results of operations of AGHL for the nine months ended
September 30, 2023. The results of operations for the three months ended December 31, 2022 extracted
from the accounting records of AGHL have been adjusted to present Retail as a discontinued operation
for the purposes of calculating the financial information for the twelve months ended September 30,
2023 presented herein. See “—Comparability of the Financial Statements—The Retail Transaction”
above. The financial information for the twelve months ended September 30, 2023 for AGHL is not
necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ended December 31, 2023 and
should not be used as the basis for or prediction of an annualized calculation. Such financial information
is a non-IFRS measure.

**Rounding**

Certain numerical figures set out in this offering memorandum, including financial information
presented in millions or thousands and percentages describing market shares, have been subject to
rounding adjustments and, as a result, the totals of the data in this offering memorandum may vary from
the actual arithmetic totals of such information. Percentages and amounts reflecting changes over time
periods relating to financial and other information set forth in this offering memorandum, in particular
“Summary Historical Financial Information and Other Data” and “Management’s Discussion and
_Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” are calculated using the rounded numerical_
data included in this offering memorandum and not the numerical data in the Financial Statements or

the relevant entity’s internal accounting system. With respect to financial information set out in this
offering memorandum, a dash (“—”) signifies that the relevant figure is zero or rounded to zero.

_detailed information included elsewhere in this offering memorandum. You should carefully read the_

_offering memorandum that are not historical facts._

**Our Company**

We are a highly diversified, leading independent insurance broker based in the United Kingdom
(“UK”) operating at scale across numerous segments of the non-life insurance market in the UK and
internationally. We provide a full range of non-life insurance products and related services across
commercial, personal and wholesale insurance. As an insurance distribution intermediary, our business
primarily consists of working with insurers to design, price, and administer insurance-related products
and services, and as such, we do not assume any underwriting or principal risk. From our formation in
2017 to the end of 2023, we have increased our revenue (excluding Retail) by over three times and our
Adjusted EBITDA (excluding Retail) by over five times, due to consistent strong organic growth and
our proven acquisition strategy. The foundations laid over the past five years have provided a platform
for further growth, which has positioned us, pro forma for all material acquisitions and disposals
completed or committed as of November 2, 2023, as a top 10 independent insurance broker and a top
20 insurance broker globally according to Reinsurance News. In September 2023, we announced the
merger and sale of our Retail Business to Markerstudy in a transaction valuing the business at £1.2
billion. See “Summary—Recent Developments—Retail Transaction.” For the twelve months ended
September 30, 2023 and excluding Retail, we generated gross written premiums (“GWP”) of £12
billion, commissions and fees of £1.2 billion, Total Pro Forma Income of £1.6 billion, organic growth
of 11.6%, Total Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA of £555.8 million and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA
margin of 33%.

We offer a broad range of non-life insurance products in multiple geographies, ranging from higher
value and lower volume bespoke corporate insurance products placed in the London Market, to SMB
business insurance policies. Each aspect of our business is highly diversified with limited concentration
or dependence on any single product, channel, carrier, income producer, or supplier. We combine this
diversified operating model with a highly collaborative culture across the Group to provide our clients,
carriers, and employees with a high-quality product and service offering. We serve a wide range of
clients that include large multinational corporations (“MNCs”), small and medium enterprises
(“SMEs”), individual consumers, and other third-party brokers and managing general agents
(“MGAs”).

We distribute our insurance products across multiple channels, including through a network of over 120
local offices in the United Kingdom and more than 150 offices worldwide, and online. Our global
network provides the basis for deep, embedded local relationships and “trusted advisor” status with
clients and benefits from long-standing trusted insurer partner relationships. We also maintain regional
hubs to support our businesses through shared resources and expertise.

Following the signing of the Retail Transaction, we have taken steps to organize our business into two
main reporting segments, which we refer to as platforms, that focus on distinct but complementary
aspects of the insurance brokerage and services value chain. See “Summary—Recent Developments—
_Retail Transaction.”_

strategy and reinsurance broker, Inver Re, an important player in this space. Specialty Broking
accounted for 34.0% of our Total Income Pro Forma for Completed Transactions and organic
growth of 13.2% for the twelve months ended September 30, 2023.

**Our Strengths**

**_Leading global independent broker positioned in resilient insurance markets_**

We are a highly diversified, leading, global independent insurance broker based in the United Kingdom.
Following our creation in 2017 as the result of a combination of long-established leading insurance
broking brands, we have rapidly grown into a top 20 global insurance broker by revenue.

_____________

1) Risk & Insurance business of Marsh only.
2) Pro forma for acquisition of Tiger Risk and Marsh R.S.
3) Pro forma for all material acquisitions and disposals completed or contractually committed as of November 2, 2023, and converted
to U.S. dollars at an exchange rate of £1 to $1.22.

We have a depth of specialist and local knowledge built-up over many years, and entrenched client
relationships and deep community penetration. We believe that our scale and diversified proposition
provides us with the ability to effectively compete with even our largest competitors and service over
four million clients as a result of our broad industry knowledge and depth of understanding of customer
needs from our team of over 8,000 professionals across more than 150 offices globally. The scale of
premium we place in the market also allows us to capture incremental earnings across the insurance
value chain and reduce costs.

As a leading global independent insurance broker, we are well positioned to continue to benefit from
the resilient and growing global non-life insurance market. The global non-life insurance market has
proven highly resilient across cycles and recessions, and has been continually growing. The global nonlife market has experienced growth of approximately 3% per annum over the past twenty years, and has
demonstrated resilience through a long track record of stable GWP growth with limited impact from
past economic or capital market downturns as demonstrated by the below chart.

As compared to other sectors, our sector benefits from low volatility and proved to be one of the most
resilient sectors through the COVID-19 pandemic. The growth in the industry is supported by favorable
market dynamics. Brokers can, in middle market segments, promote strong client relations as a result
of this low volatility and foster recurring revenue. We were able to maintain organic growth of
approximately 3% from 2017 through 2020, and increased organic growth (excluding Retail) of 10.2%,
12.5% and 11.6% in 2021, 2022 and the twelve months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.

We are regionally diversified, earning 34% of our GWPs for the twelve months ended September 30,
2023 (excluding the Retail Transaction) in the UK, 30% in North America, 15% in Europe, 10% in the
APAC region, 8% in the LATAM region and 3% in the AMEA region, and our worldwide business is
positioned at the center of global insurance markets as shown on the map below.

-----

Our global presence covers the major global insurance hubs and provides us with global access and
insight. We established Ardonagh Global Partners in 2021 to invest in strong platforms operating in
attractive markets and verticals outside the UK and Europe and to partner with management teams who
want to grow faster as part of a larger group while retaining operational independence. Since its
inception, Ardonagh Global Partners has grown to include Resilium, one of Australia’s largest
independently-owned intermediary networks and the founding business of our Australia platform, and
Ethos Broking Australia, which invests in or directly acquires brokers. Ardonagh Global Partners also
includes Hemsley Wynne Furlonge, a specialist M&A warranty and indemnity insurance broker and
advisor, MDS Group, an insurance broker and risk management advisor across the Portuguese-speaking
world and Europe, the only Portuguese Lloyd’s Broker and the largest independent broker in Brazil,
and Envest, an Australian-based insurance investment and distribution group, which now houses
Australian assets Resilium and Epsilon Underwriting within the Group.

**_Scaled platform with significant diversification across geographies and capabilities_**

Our business is highly diversified across products, customers, channels, geographies and carriers. We
offer a wide-ranging product portfolio across both general and bespoke insurance products and services
across the insurance value chain, including personal and commercial lines, wholesale distribution,
underwriting and insurance outsourcing services to large corporations, insurers, third-party brokers,
SMEs, and individual consumers at a variety of price points, without assuming any underwriting or
principal risk in relation to any of the services or products that we provide. For the twelve months ended
September 30, 2023, no single line of business accounted for more than 20% of GWP. We reach
customers through diverse distribution channels, including through our digital platform, telephone
contact centers, and traditional face-to-face customer contact via our network of over 150 offices
globally.

As a result of our international presence, our GWP is diversified by geography, with 66% of our
premium (excluding the Retail Transaction) placed outside the UK (specifically, 30% of our premium
is placed in North America and 15% is placed in Europe). We have long-standing partnerships with key
carriers, and relationships more broadly with a wide range of insurance carriers in each of the markets
that we serve. Our large number of carrier relationships mitigates potential carrier concentration risks
and enables us to enhance and improve our product offerings for clients as well as pricing and our own

commercial terms. For the twelve months ended September 30, 2023, no single carrier accounted for
more than 7% of our total GWP, with the top five carriers in aggregate representing less than 25% of
total GWP. Our gross written premiums by geographical region, class of business and carrier are shown
in the chart below:

_______

(1) LTM premiums to September 2023; pro forma to exclude Retail and include Assepro.

Our highly diversified offering ensures minimal reliance on any particular product, distribution channel,
customer, or market, limiting our exposure to any adverse industry developments and macroeconomic
factors and thereby mitigating volatility in our overall financial performance. In addition, the breadth
of our offering provides us with various avenues through which we can identify gaps in the market and
develop specialized products to capture unmet demand. We are thus able take advantage of cross-selling
opportunities to increase our customer penetration and drive incremental growth.

**_Robust, accelerating organic growth benefitting from the realization of key strategic initiatives_**

We have a track record of delivering strong organic income and margin growth. By leveraging our
scaled platform and best practices, we have negotiated superior terms with insurer counterparties,
industry participants, and suppliers, enabling us to offer a better experience and pricing to our
customers. We also value diversity and keeping up with current technologic trends, prioritizing
investments in people and data and technology. As a result, we have grown the business every quarter
(compared with the prior year period) since our establishment in 2017 and have achieved double-digit
organic growth since 2021, growing 10.2% in 2021, 12.5% in 2022 and 11.6% (excluding Retail) in the
twelve months ended September 30, 2023. Our organic growth is driven, in part, by our key strategic
initiatives across our segments, as outlined below.

_Global P&C: UK Advisory_

- _Drive new business: Targeting large corporate clients with focused expertise and leveraging_
data and single customer view to cross-sell products within Advisory and between platforms

- _Enhanced placement: Reducing the number of markets from 750 to 185 to improve client_
outcomes and reduce costs, giving partners white label access to existing binders and
specialties, which allows them the opportunity to re-brand such binders and products, and
leveraging increased scale to increase commission rates paid by customers across business

- _Grow our digital proposition: Enhancing our online offering to improve the customer journey_
and reduce costs, and entering into affinity partner deals

6


-----

- _Integration:_ Focusing on integration through significant new opportunities for value creation
with rapid integration of further “add-on” accretive acquisitions

_Global P&C: International Advisory_

- _Identify strategic markets: Focusing on select regions that fulfill our acquisition criteria and_
clearly focus on larger, more sophisticated markets with growing macroeconomic conditions
and a developed regulatory environment

- _Utilize networks:_ Leveraging our networks and the wider broker networks to identify suitable
assets and targeting attractive off-market opportunities at below market multiples

- _Realize synergies:_ Rapidly integrating acquisitions to realize significant cost and revenue
synergies

- _Roll-out best practices: Establishing initiatives to accelerate organic growth and improve_
margin and cash flow conversion, and to provide access to new products and capacity

_Specialty Broking_

- _Producer hires:_ Driving existing producer hires to maturity and hiring new individuals who can
add value quickly with a relentless focus on renewal retention, leveraging existing retail and
wholesale relationships

- _Digital solutions:_ Leveraging and overlaying external tools to attract new business and protect
existing business, employing digital solutions to get us closer to our end client

- _Portfolio & Placement:_ Engaging with Ardonagh Portfolio Solutions (“APS”) for select lines
such as terrorism, financial institution, personal injury and cyber in order to increase
commissions, and actively managing portfolio to reduce exposure to underperforming lines

- _Global strategy: Maximizing inflow from growing Global P&C platform, leveraging network_
memberships to increase existing business and inflow and capitalizing on footprint to drive
further growth

Our organic growth has been further supported over the past five years by delivering value from our
new producer hires. We have generated Adjusted EBITDA of approximately £30 million for the twelve
months ended September 30, 2023 from 29 maturing producer teams hired since 2020. Teams typically
mature to their full profitability potential approximately three years after the expiry of capacity or
covenant restriction. We have seven teams hired in 2020 that were at 75% maturity as of September 30,
2023, seven teams hired in 2021 at 58% maturity as of September 30, 2023, seven teams hired in 2022
at 37% maturity as of September 30, 2023 and eight teams that started trading in the nine months ended
September 30, 2023. As a result, we expect to realize additional Adjusted EBITDA as a result of these
hires over the next three years.

**_Proven ability to grow through thoughtful, highly accretive acquisitions and disciplined integration_**

We have a long-term track record and well-established process for identifying, executing, and
integrating highly accretive acquisitions across many geographies. We have completed or entered into
acquisition agreements for more than 150 acquisitions since our establishment in 2017, which represents
an enterprise value of over £3.2 billion with a year-to-date average “add-on” enterprise value multiple
of 6.6 times and a “platform” enterprise value multiple of 9.6 times. We also have a further 36
acquisitions that are contractually committed or under signed letter of intent as of February 1, 2024,
which would contribute an additional £32.2 million of Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA.This track record
of successful acquisitions is shown in the below chart.

We have built our Global P&C franchise by building on our UK Advisory business and carefully
selected regional platforms. We have built our Specialty Broking business by investing in carefully
strategic producer hires and specialisms. In the past three years, we have expanded our addressable
markets through acquisitions in new synergistic geographies. In 2020, we acquired our first non-UK
business, Arachas, Ireland’s largest commercial insurance broker, which kick-started our international
operations. We have since established our latest standalone platform, International Advisory, under
which we are consolidating our non-UK broking enterprises and related investments and under which
we have launched our Ardonagh Europe and our Ardonagh Global Partners businesses. We established
Ardonagh Global Partners in 2021 to invest in leading platforms operating in attractive markets and
verticals outside the UK and Europe and to partner with management teams who want to grow faster as
part of a larger group while retaining operational independence. Since its inception, Ardonagh Global
Partners has grown to include various brands, including Resilium, one of Australia’s largest
independently owned intermediary networks and the founding business of our Australian platform and
Ethos Broking Australia, which invests in or directly acquires brokers. We continue to have a robust
M&A pipeline, and we continue to explore larger transaction opportunities both in the UK and
internationally with a strong focus on market-leading platforms in our international business.

To successfully complete and integrate such a large amount of acquisitions, we follow a clear,
disciplined and highly selective acquisition strategy. We encourage competition between segments in
order to receive centrally controlled capital for acquisitions, and we employ a rigorous due diligence
process that is implemented by our highly experienced and dedicated team of investment professionals.
Given the scope of our operational footprint, we are also able to leverage deep local knowledge in our
markets in order to further understand our targets. Our primary focus when reviewing potential
opportunities is on the customer proposition and financial returns. We have also implemented a robust
and efficient integration and post-deal tracking process after closing.

8


-----

Our disciplined execution focuses on a clear, orderly and highly selective strategy based on ten
principles: strategic fit, cultural fit, integration commitment, aligned incentives, financial returns,
synergy discipline, cash discipline, realistic plan, risk assessment and clear accountability. We perform
a rigorous due diligence process through a highly experienced and dedicated team of investment
professionals, leveraging deep local knowledge in the markets where we operate and a robust and
efficient integration and post-deal tracking process. We are able to present ourselves as the acquirer of
choice by emphasizing our culture, aligning interests and maintaining discipline. In addition, we have
made significant investments in our technology platform, which allows us to integrate new acquisitions
at low cost and with low integration risk.

**_Leading data and analytics capabilities driving platform efficiencies_**

Our leading centralized data and analytics capabilities allow us to enhance risk solutions for capacity
providers and improve outcomes for our clients and to drive cost savings. These capabilities have been
primarily utilized to support the building of broker facilities, which then allow us to access
predominantly traditional capacity in more efficient ways for the client. For example, we have used data
and analytics to significantly improve and re-package older previous products into better terms, cover
and product for our clients, including improvements on the Terrorism, Fine Art Jewellery and Specie
facilities. We have also used data and analytics to introduce brand new facilities to the market, such as
a Construction facility and a cross-class facility named LECTIO. The following chart shows our
centralized data analytics structure, where we have centralized global premium and carrier information
using our data center based in Mullingar, Ireland.

As an example, in our Specialty Broking platform, we have built facilities such as the Ardonagh
Portfolio Solutions (“APS”) business to use data analytics and capabilities to bring benefits to both
clients, in terms of wider market placement, and our Group, in terms of increased revenues.

Our technology and scale facilities have also allowed us to identify cost savings totalling approximately
£15.8 million that we expect to achieve within the next 12 months. In our Global P&C: UK Advisory
segment, we expect cost savings of £3.2 million, primarily as a result of a target model implementation
project that has reduced headcount through efficiency gains from optimizing policy administration
systems, an IT transformation from improving the office network, which is aimed at removing legacy
applications and outsourcing, and an onshoring finance project expected to deliver benefits from process
efficiencies and automation. In our Global P&C: International Advisory segment, we expect cost
savings of £3.9 million from synergies through our hub-and-spoke model and by integrating further
acquisitions into our existing platforms. In our Specialty Broking segment, we expect cost savings of

9


-----

£8.2 million from a technology-led transformation of middle- and back-office functions. We have also
identified cost synergies in connection with the acquisition of Corant Global, including harmonization
of reward structures, footprint consolidation and back-office optimization, and the acquisition of the
Oxford Insurance Group. We have also identified cost savings of £0.5 million through back-office
optimization in our Corporate function.

**_Attractive financial profile with strong growth, profitability and cash flow conversion_**

Since our establishment in 2017, we have delivered a transformational improvement in our quality of
earnings and have had strong performance across all metrics. We experienced a four times increase in
revenue (including Retail) from 2017 to Total Pro Forma Income (excluding Retail) in the twelve
months ended September 30, 2023 and a seven times increase in Adjusted EBITDA (including Retail)
to Total Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA (excluding Retail) during the same period. We also experienced
a more than eight percentage points increase in organic growth from 2017 to the twelve months ended
September 30, 2023 (excluding Retail) and a more than 13 percentage point increase in Adjusted
EBITDA margin over the same time period (excluding Retail).

We have designed our business model to generate high EBITDA margins with limited working capital
and maintenance capital expenditure requirements, resulting in management operating cash flow of
£420 million and an operating cash conversion of 86% in the twelve months ended September 30, 2023.
Since our establishment, we have delivered a transformational improvement in quality of earnings,
primarily as a result of significant investments towards transformative cost-savings programs and
synergy initiatives in our business to create a scalable and efficient platform that is conducive to future
growth, resulting in approximately £150 million of realized cost-savings since the start of 2018. Our
investments have resulted in a continued and rapid improvement in our quality of earnings as cost
savings are delivered and one-time costs have decreased. We believe that our cash generative business
model is highly scalable and that we will be able to leverage our well-invested infrastructure as we
continue to grow organically and via acquisitions.

Our transformational improvement in quality of earnings has improved cash generation. In the twelve
months ended September 30, 2023, we had management operating cash flow of £420 million and an
operating cash conversion of 86% in the twelve months ended September 30, 2023. We believe that our
cash generative business model is highly scalable and that we will be able to leverage our well-invested
infrastructure as we continue to grow organically and via acquisitions. The continuing contribution from
new producer hires already made but not yet at maturity and from enhanced and alternative capacity
arrangements in place to better serve our existing customers also supports our cash generation.

**_Deep, aligned management team well positioned to drive culture and lead ongoing growth_**

Our management team is highly experienced in leading and growing successful insurance intermediary
organizations. Our Chief Executive Officer, David Ross, has over 25 years of industry experience
building and leading brokerage businesses including leading transformative mergers and acquisitions
in the insurance intermediary field. Mr. Ross is supported by a highly experienced management team
with over 25 years of industry experience on average, with a strong track record of delivering on
transformative change and investment. Our Chief Financial Officer, Diane Cougill, has over 20 years
of industry experience and has held senior leadership positions at RAC and at Aviva. Our senior
management team also includes Aurelio Cusaro, our Chief Investment Officer, John Tiner, our
Chairman, Geoff Gouriet, our General Counsel, and Sarah Dalgarno, our Chief Risk Officer. Our Global
P&C senior management includes Rob Worrell, Chief Executive Officer of our UK Advisory segment,
Conor Brennan, Chairman of our International Advisory segment and Des O’Connor, Chief Investment
Officer of our International Advisory segment. Our Specialty Broking senior management includes
Chief Executive Officer Andrew Wallin and Chairman James Masterson. Together, this team leads a
deep bench of revenue-producing talent and committed operational support staff, all of whom have been
specifically targeted for their entrepreneurial spirit and ability to drive sustainable revenue growth. The
culture cultivated by our senior management team leads to our continued success in the insurance
market and differentiates itself from other competitors in various ways, including:

  - An emphasis on entrepreneurship at a local level with strong organizational alignment, resulting
in colleagues working together towards common, Group-wide objectives,

  - Continuous cross-group collaboration to amplify the best of our collective experience and
insight,

  - The application of the depth and breadth of our specialist expertise, built through years of
market leadership,

  - Our tailored and innovative solutions and ability to understand what works for each industry,
market and client,

  - Our deep relationships with clients built through longstanding service, accountability and trust,
and

  - Our regular programming to celebrate special accomplishments and promote internal events.

These factors have resulted in over 90% client retention based on strong relationships, knowledge and
expertise, stickiness of specialist products and high barriers to entry, and 95% average producer
retention across last five years (excluding non-regrettable leavers), as a result of our ability to leverage
a broader platform, our emphasis on training, development and support, our aligned incentives with
producers and our collaborative and cohesive culture.

Management and employees are incentivized directly or indirectly through a combination of B ordinary
share ownership at Tara Topco Limited and/or participation in various broad equity and performance

schemes, the value of which are linked to the achievement of long term, sustainable, and profitable
growth. We also benefit from the support, significant investment experience and industry network in
the insurance broking and underwriting market of our long-term majority shareholders, HPS Investment
Partners and Madison Dearborn Partners, who in aggregate directly or indirectly own over 90% of our
equity capital. HPS Investment Partners and Madison Dearborn Partners have been highly supportive
of our management and have demonstrated their continued commitment to Ardonagh by investing $2.7
billion in common equity over the past years.

**Our Strategies**

**_Accelerate organic growth by optimizing placement strategy and driving new business through new_**
**_products, cross-selling and up-selling_**

We seek to consistently achieve double-digit organic growth across our overall business by expanding
product portfolios, streamlining operations, increasing penetration of our customer base—particularly
in new synergistic geographies—through concerted sales efforts across our Group and capitalizing on
a targeted acquisitions pipeline. We have a growing pipeline of new specialist products that is highly
complementary to our existing offerings, including high net worth, political violence, specialty
terrorism facility. These products are being developed on existing systems and channels at limited
upfront cost and are largely linked to new hires, who can contribute the relevant product and channel
expertise. As an example, new products launched in our Specialty Broking platform contributed towards
organic growth of approximately 11.6% in the twelve months ended September 30, 2023.

As part of our organic growth strategy, we are also focused on cross-selling and up-selling and customer
retention and expansion. We seek to improve cross-selling and up-selling across Group clients,
including by leveraging data. We have rolled out of a Group-wide database in which we collate data
from each of our platforms to enable a “single view of the client” (i.e., how many policies are linked to
each client across personal and commercial lines) to facilitate retention, cross-selling and up-selling.
This database continues to provide a more granular understanding of our clients’ needs, allowing us to
offer them tailored cross-selling opportunities. We have also implemented a bespoke pricing system
and leveraged our data infrastructure, fraud detection capabilities and access to third-party data sources
to improve retention and increase customer lifetime value across most products. In our Specialty
Broking platform, we have developed a highly sophisticated customer and broker-facing software
which interfaces with several market-leading policy administrative systems and substantially improves
ease of access to customer and broker data. We are also in discussions with several third-party brokers
who are clients of our wholesale platform to roll-out this software in order to maximize efficiency and
centralization within our platform and improve the experience of third-party brokers on our platform.
We also intend to leverage our membership of the Worldwide Broker Network to increase existing
business and in-flow through the establishment of new relationships and intend to capitalize on our
existing global footprint to drive further growth. In the UK, our UK Advisory business launched a
focused client strategy aimed at large UK corporates, which is already bearing fruit with the successful
signing of several marquee clients, including a global broadcaster that has a £5 billion turnover and also
the UK’s largest charity.

In addition, in 2021, we launched Inver Re, a new risk strategy and reinsurance broker with ambitions
to harness our scale, resources and reach to offer a credible alternative to global brokers and become
our industry’s independent reinsurance broker of choice. We plan to further strengthen our reinsurance
operations by (i) consolidating our existing reinsurance operations while organically building out our
brand, talent and capabilities in key global hubs (such as London, North America & Bermuda), (ii)
developing our first party business through leveraging key group carrier relationships, (iii) hiring
industry leading talent and building further revenue streams and (iv) deploying M&A to expand
geographic focus beyond key hubs (such as in Latin America and Asia).

**_Streamline operations through our continued focus on capacity excellence, talent excellence and_**
**_operational excellence_**

We are constantly re-examining our operating models to incrementally streamline lower value-add
operations and further support our front-office distribution and client service capabilities. We have
developed a range of strategies to streamline operations and optimize middle and back-office functions.
Our strategy is based on three key pillars of excellence, which are:

- _Capacity excellence. We seek to reach capacity excellence by operating a strategic capacity_
model through our Ardonagh Portfolio Solutions (“APS”) business, part of our Specialty
Broking platform. APS utilizes data captured from across the Group’s platforms and businesses
to enhance income through a centralized placement. We expect our APS business to be a key
growth driver going forward by allowing us to capitalize on a select number of strategic carrier
relationships, create market leading products which offer better terms for our customers and
access alternative capital providers either directly or in connection with our MGA business. We
intend to engage with APS for select high-profitability lines and actively manage the portfolio
to reduce exposure to underperforming lines.

- _Talent excellence. We believe that we will be able to deliver significant incremental income_
and EBITDA growth by nurturing talent excellence. We are working to attract the best people
in our industry and are ideally placed to capitalize on market dislocation. We believe that
incoming hires bring capabilities and are highly accretive. We have a strong track record of
income hires and producer recruitment, delivering significant incremental income and
EBITDA. We intend to leverage our success to date to continue selective transformational hires,
focusing on hiring exceptional individuals who can swiftly add value to our Group. Since 2019,
we have secured at least five new specialist team hires per year, and currently have a deep
pipeline of future hires. We also intend to deliver on exceptional existing hires, relentlessly
focusing on renewal retention, leveraging existing retail and wholesale relationships.

- _Operational excellence. We believe that through operational excellence we can continue our_
track record of delivering value through our focus on operational expertise. We have delivered
cost efficiencies to drive margin expansion across all divisions, resulting in approximately £150
million of synergies and cost savings delivered to date since the start of 2018, and £15.8 million
of cost savings and cost synergies expected to be delivered within the next twelve months,
consisting of (i) £3.2 million within the UK Advisory platform resulting from benefits from a
target operating model implementation project that has reduced headcount through efficiency
gains from optimizing policy administration systems, IT transformations from improving the
office network, removing legacy applications and outsourcing and an onshoring finance project
expected to deliver benefits from process efficiencies and automation, (ii) £8.2 million within
the Specialty Broking platform resulting from the technology-led transformation of our middle
and back office functions and the cost synergies identified with the acquisition of Corant
Global, including the harmonization of reward structures, footprint consolidation and backoffice optimization, as well as the acquisition of Oxford Insurance, (iii) £3.9 million within the
International Advisory platform through the ‘hub and spoke’ model and the integration of
further acquisitions into existing platforms and (iv) £0.5 million through back-office
optimization in our Corporate segment.

We also continue to make significant investments into our technology platform, as we believe that
digital solutions will get us closer to our end client, allowing us to leverage and overlay external tools
to attract new business and protect existing business.

**_Expand our addressable markets in new synergistic geographies_**

We intend to continue expanding our addressable markets in synergistic geographies. In 2021 we
established our International Advisory platform, under which we are consolidating our non-UK broking
enterprises and related investments and under which we have launched our Ardonagh Europe and our

13


-----

Ardonagh Global Partners businesses. We established Ardonagh Global Partners in 2021 to invest in
leading platforms operating in attractive markets and verticals outside the UK and Europe and to partner
with management teams who want to grow faster as part of a larger group while retaining operational
independence. We intend to continue growing our International Advisory platform with the aim of
consolidating our presence in a selected portfolio of fast-growing markets and expanding participation
in select new products and markets where there is significant synergy between our UK platforms and
our International Advisory platform. We are focusing on a number of regions which fulfil our
acquisition criteria, and intend to employ the hub and spoke methodology to quickly expand our
regional presence. Our aim is to develop a number of regional hubs, with specialist knowledge,
technology and product expertise, to support in-country assets, and we intend to focus on strategic
markets with assets that are capable of executing further in-country expansion.

**_Continue to grow by capitalizing on targeted acquisitions pipeline_**

As part of our strategy, we target additional growth expected from accretive acquisitions, and intend to
further strengthen our position and broaden our portfolio by continuing to consolidate smaller players
in the highly fragmented and competitive UK and international insurance markets. Any acquisition we
pursue will be in line with our targeted and selective acquisition criteria focused on companies with
attractive profitability, growth potential and complementary business operations. We utilize our
network to identify suitable targets at reasonable multiples. We support acquired assets post-acquisition
in order to achieve our organic growth plans going forward, utilizing our expertise and networks. We
also manage the realization of identified revenue and cost synergies on an ongoing basis. We have a
highly disciplined and proven acquisition program, which includes a standardized approach to
integration and synergy delivery, which, together with the proven execution ability of our management
team and our strong focus on value creation and financial metrics, allows us to maximize synergies and
rapidly deploy economies of scale to acquired businesses.

We have a robust M&A pipeline underpinned by a rigorous evaluation and assessment process driven
by an experienced and dedicated team of M&A professionals, and we continue to explore larger
transaction opportunities both in the UK and internationally with a strong focus on market-leading
platforms in our international business. Acquisitions completed during the fourth quarter of 2023
(including the impact of the AccuRisk disposal) contributed Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA of £13.6
million for the twelve months ended September 30, 2023, and acquisitions completed between January
1, 2024 and February 1, 2024 contributed an additional £3.0 million. We have a further 36 acquisitions
that are contractually committed or under signed letter of intent as of February 1, 2024, which would
contribute an additional £32.2 million of Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA. Our pipeline includes targets
on multiple continents. We are also actively pursuing other acquisitions in the near-term or very nearterm, including one or more potentially material acquisitions.

**Recent Developments**

**_Retail Transaction_**

In September 2023, we announced the merger and disposal of the Retail Business with the Markerstudy
Group Limited (the “Merged Business”), with our shareholders maintaining a minority stake in the
Merged Business. The transaction values the Retail Business at £1.2 billion and will be funded by a
new investment led by Pollen Street Capital and Bain Capital Special Situations. We expect to receive
upfront cash consideration of up to £820 million (on a debt free/cash free basis, excluding transaction
fees and expenses, and deferred cash consideration linked to related investments) and an approximately
£400 million promissory note receivable from a related-party entity (“RP Entity”). The RP Entity is
wholly owned by our shareholders and will, with Retail management, receive a 23% equity stake in the
Merged Business. The promissory note receivable to be entered into in connection with the completion
of the Retail Transaction will accrue interest at a fixed rate of 15% (compounding annually), which will
be mandatorily prepaid on any realization of the stake in the Merged Business or a change of control of
the RP Entity, and will require the RP Entity not to incur debt, grant security or make distributions

14


-----

without the consent of our Group. We expect to distribute this promissory note receivable to a parent
entity of the Parent following the completion of the Retail Transactions. In addition, certain exiting
managers will continue to hold shares in management incentive plans within the Group following the
completion of the Retail Transactions, and we will buyback such manager’s shares upon exit or
otherwise winding up such plan.

The Retail Transaction is subject to the satisfaction of certain closing conditions, including customary
regulatory and antitrust approvals from both the FCA and the CMA. We expect completion of the Retail
Transaction to occur in the second or third quarter of 2024. The Retail Transaction is subject to
customary transaction risks, including of delay due to longer than expected regulatory reviews or
actions. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—The Retail Transaction may
_be delayed or may not proceed to completion.”_

As a result of the Retail Transaction, in our Unaudited Interim Financial Statements, we have presented
Retail as held for sale on our consolidated statement of financial position as of September 30, 2023 and
as a discontinued operation on our consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive
income for the nine months period ended September 30, 2023 and the period ended September 30, 2022.

We expect a significant portion of the cash proceeds from the Retail Transaction will be applied, subject
to certain exceptions and limits, in mandatorily prepaying at par a portion of our New Senior Secured
Credit Facilities. More generally, we expect the Retail Transaction to release capital to invest in our
higher-growth Specialty Broking and our Global P&C Platforms. See also “Business—Retail—Retail
_Transaction.”_

If the Retail Transaction does not proceed to completion, our ratio of as adjusted total net debt to Total
Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA would be 5.8x, as calculated by adjusting as adjusted total net debt to
remove the net proceeds from the Retail Transaction, including Retail Total EBITDA, and adding Lease
Liabilities associated with the Retail Divestiture.

**_Recent Acquisitions and Disposals_**

We completed 16 acquisitions between October 1, 2023 and December 31, 2023 and have completed 6
acquisitions from January 1, 2024 to February 1, 2024. Notable acquisitions during this period included:

- Assepro, one of the largest independent commercial brokers for SMEs in Switzerland, with
further operations in Austria and Liechtenstein. Assepro places CHF1.2 billion of premium
annually and further strengthens Ardonagh International’s presence across Europe.

- RiskSTOP Group, a provider of insurance technology and risk management services to UK
insurer and broking communities. The acquisition is highly complementary to Ardonagh UK
Advisory’s existing digital client offering.

- London Australia Underwriting (“LAUW”), an underwriting agency specializing in
professional and financial lines exclusively on behalf of Lloyd’s of London syndicates. This
extends agency coverage in Australia and further diversifies Ardonagh International Advisory’s
Australian platform.

Additionally, 36 acquisitions are contractually committed or under signed letter of intent across Europe,
Australia, the UK, Brazil and Ireland as of February 1, 2024.

In December 2023, we disposed of the subsidiaries of Alpha Investment Holdings Limited, which
includes the AccuRisk Solutions LLC group of entities. They were acquired by Ryan Specialty, an
international specialty insurance firm.

**_The New Senior Secured Credit Facilities_**

The Company, among others, as of the date of this offering memorandum, is in the proceeds of
negotiating and expect to establish, new additional facilities under its credit facility agreement dated as
of June 26, 2020, among the Company and, among others, the administrative agent and the lenders party
thereto (as amended and/or restated from time to time, the “Senior Secured Credit Facilities
**Agreement”) governing a multi-currency senior secured term loan facility of up to £2,006 million**
(equivalent), split into a U.S. dollar-denominated Facility B of up to £1,200 million (equivalent) (the
“USD Term Facility”), a euro-denominated Facility B of up to £696 million (equivalent) (the “EUR
**Term Facility”) and a Australian dollar-denominated Facility B of up to £111 million (equivalent) (the**
“AUD Term Facility” and together with the USD Term Facility and the EUR Term Facility, the “New
**Term Facilities”) and senior secured delayed draw term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount**
of $175 million, a senior secured delayed draw term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of
€165 million and a senior secured delayed draw term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of
AUD 100 million (collectively, the “CAR Facility”). We are, as of the date of this offering
memorandum, in the process of negotiating, and expect to amend, our existing multi-currency new
revolving credit facility to provide for borrowings of between £240-300 million (equivalent) (the
“Revolving Credit Facility” and together with the New Term Facilities and the CAR Facility, the
“New Senior Secured Credit Facilities”).

The New Senior Secured Credit Facilities will be secured on a first-priority basis by the Shared
Collateral and guaranteed by the Guarantors on a senior basis. See “Description of Other Indebtedness
_and Financing Arrangements—Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement.” Proceeds from the New_
Term Facilities will be used to repay the outstanding drawings under the Senior Secured Facilities
Agreement on or about the Escrow Release Date. See “Use of Proceeds”. To the extent we do not
receive the required third-party consent required to refinance the Australian Local Facility, we may not
fund the AUD Term Facility and the Australian Local Facility may remain outstanding.

**_Existing Notes Redemption_**

In addition, on or about the Escrow Release Date, the Issuer will use a portion of the proceeds of the
Notes to redeem and/or satisfy and discharge all obligations outstanding under the indenture governing
the Existing Notes by paying the applicable redemption price of the Existing Notes plus accrued and
unpaid interest thereon to the date of redemption (the “Existing Notes Redemption”). See “Use of
_Proceeds”._

The entry into the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement, the Offering, the entry into the
Intercreditor Agreement and the application of the proceeds from the Senior Secured Credit Facilities
Agreement and the Offering are collectively referred to in this offering memorandum as the
“Transactions.”

Escrow Account

Concurrently with the closing of the Offering, the initial purchasers will deposit the gross proceeds of
the Notes into escrow accounts (the “Escrow Accounts”) in the names of the respective Issuers, but
controlled by the Trustee, Ankura Trust Company, LLC, as escrow agent (in such capacity, together
with its successors, the “Escrow Agent”) pending funding under the New Term Facilities as described
under as described in “—Recent Developments—The Refinancing,” and pledged on a first-ranking basis
in favor of the Trustee on behalf of the holders of the respective series of Notes. The release of the
escrow proceeds will be subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. If the conditions to the release
of the escrow proceeds have not been satisfied on or prior to March 31, 2024 (the “Escrow Longstop
**Date”) or upon the occurrence of certain other events, the Notes will be subject to a special mandatory**
redemption as described under “—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.” The special
mandatory redemption price of the Notes will be equal to 100% of the aggregate issue price of the

16

respective Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but excluding such
special mandatory redemption date.

(1) Retail is presented as a discontinued operation in the consolidated statement of profit and loss and other comprehensive income in
the financial information of AGHL for the three months and the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2023, and
therefore excluded from the results presented in the above table. Please see “—Summary Historical Financial and Other
_Information—Other Consolidated and Pro Forma Data.”_

(2) Figures for the three months and year ended December 31, 2023 are approximates.

(3) Based on the perimeter of the Group as of December 31, 2023.

The increase in Total Income for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended
December 31, 2022 was primarily due to organic performance growth combined with further
acquisitions. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the
year ended December 31, 2022 was primarily driven by organic performance growth combined with
further acquisitions.

During the three months ended December 31, 2023, we entered into certain transactions that impacted
our statement of financial position. In October 2023, we increased our borrowings by drawing $130.0
million of USD Facility B6 under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement. As of December 31,
2023, we had £283 million equivalent of undrawn Facilities consisting of $182.5 million and $171.7
million respectively under USD Facilities B5 and B6 of our Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement.
On January 10, 2024, we drew the remaining $182.5 million USD B5 Facility and have $171.7 million
undrawn of the USD Facility B6 as of February 2, 2024. In addition to this, the £191.5 million RCF
remains undrawn as of February 2, 2024. We may draw down the remaining USD Facility B6 prior to
the closing of the Transactions to fund acquisitions in February and March. We also entered into a large

17

new lease in its Specialty Broking segment, which increased its IFRS lease liabilities by approximately
£14 million. In addition, the calculation of the amount of our debt based on our foreign exchange rates
changed. We are currently using an exchange rate of $1.25/£1.00 and €1.15/£1.00. We disposed of
AccuRisk (and received the cash from the disposal on December 1, 2023) and acquired Assepro along
with other acquisitions. See “—Recent Acquisitions and Disposals” above. We also received a AUD
150 million equity investment into its Australian business. Our Available Cash as of December 31, 2023
was approximately £308 million.

**SUMMARY CORPORATE AND FINANCING STRUCTURE**

The diagram below provides a simplified overview of our corporate and financing structure on a
consolidated basis as of the date of this offering memorandum, after giving effect to the Transactions
and the use of proceeds from the Offering. The diagram does not include all entities in our group and
does not include management shareholders, nor does it show all liabilities in our group. For a summary
of the material financing arrangements identified in the diagram, see “Description of Other
_Indebtedness and Financing Arrangements” and “Description of the Notes.”_

_____________

(1) As of the date of this offering memorandum, 31.15% of the voting interests in Tara Topco Limited are owned, indirectly, by funds
managed, advised and/or controlled by HPS Investment Partners, LLC (“HPS”) or its affiliates, 67.48% of the voting interests are
owned by entities affiliated with MDP and the remaining 1.37% of voting interests are held by other minority shareholders. See
“Shareholders” and “Management—Management Equity Interests.”

(2) Following completion of the Tara Transactions on May 30, 2022, the corporate structure of the Group changed. This impacted our
financial information as we previously reported our results at the level of The Ardonagh Group Limited. On May 31, 2022, The
Ardonagh Group Limited merged into the Group’s new indirect parent company, Tara Topco Limited. Following this merger,
AGHL acquired Ardonagh New Midco 3 Limited, including the Group companies that were previously owned by The Ardonagh
Group Limited, on June 1, 2022, and has become the reporting entity for the Group. See “Presentation of Financial Information.”

(3) The Parent, which will be a Guarantor of the Senior Notes, is the top entity in the restricted group under the Senior Indenture and
the direct parent of the Senior Notes Issuer. Upon consummation of the Offering, the Senior Notes Issuer will on-loan the proceeds
of the Senior Notes Offering to the Parent and enter into the Senior Proceeds Loan.

(4) The Senior Notes Issuer is a private limited liability company incorporated under the laws of Jersey for the purpose of the
Transactions and other potential transactions and is not expected to engage in any activities other than those related to its formation,
the Transactions and other future transactions permitted by the Senior Indenture. The Senior Notes Issuer is a wholly owned, direct
subsidiary of the Parent. The Senior Notes Issuer’s only material assets and liabilities will be its outstanding indebtedness under
the Senior Notes, the receivable under the Senior Proceeds Loan, any other future indebtedness and certain intercompany balances,
and any other assets or liabilities that arise as a result of transactions not prohibited by the Senior Indenture. The Senior Notes
Issuer’s rights under the Senior Proceeds Loan will be assigned to the Security Agent and form part of the Topco Collateral.

19


-----

(5) The Senior Notes Issuer is offering $1,000,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes. The Senior Notes will be general
senior obligations of the Issuer, will rank pari passu in right of payment with all of the Senior Notes Issuer’s existing and future
indebtedness that is not expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Senior Notes, will rank senior in right of payment to all
existing and future indebtedness of the Senior Notes Issuer that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Senior Notes,
will be effectively subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness of the Senior Notes Issuer that is secured by property and
assets that do not secure the Senior Notes or that is secured on a first-priority basis over property or assets that secure the Senior
Notes on a second-priority basis, in each case to the extent of the value of the property and assets securing such obligation or
indebtedness, including obligations under the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement and certain
hedging obligations.

The Senior Notes will not be guaranteed on the Issue Date. Subject to and in accordance with the Agreed Security Principles, on
the Escrow Release Date, the Senior Notes will be guaranteed (the “Senior **Note Guarantees”) on a senior basis by the Parent and**
on a subordinated basis by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Company, and Ardonagh Finco Plc, Ardonagh Services Limited
and the New SFA Borrowers (the “Subsidiary Guarantors” and together with the Company and, in respect of the Senior Notes
only, the Parent and the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the “Guarantors”). Given the regulated nature of our business, we have
limited ability to grant upstream credit support. As a result, the Issuers and the Guarantors will represent approximately 4.3% of
our Adjusted EBITDA (including Retail) for the twelve months ended September 30, 2023. We have granted security in respect of
the Senior Secured Notes from additional non-guarantor entities, which together with the Issuers and the Guarantors, represent
52.1% of our Adjusted EBITDA (including Retail) for the twelve months ended September 30, 2023.

Concurrently with the closing of the Offering, the initial purchasers will deposit the gross proceeds of the Senior Notes into one or
more escrow accounts (the “Senior Escrow Accounts”) in the names of the Senior Notes Issuer, but controlled by the Escrow
Agent pending funding under the New Term Facilities, and pledged on a first-ranking basis in favor of the Trustee on behalf of the
holders of the Senior Notes. Subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the Intercreditor Agreement and certain perfection
requirements, the Senior Notes and the Senior Note Guarantees will be secured on or about the date the proceeds of the Notes are
released to the Issuers from the Escrow Accounts (the “Escrow Release Date”), on (a) a first-ranking basis, by security over (i)
the shares of the Parent held by Ardonagh Midco 1 Ltd. (“Topco”); (ii) structural intercompany receivables owed to Topco by the
Parent (if any); (iii) the shares of the Senior Notes Issuer held by the Parent; and (iv) the Senior Proceeds Loan and any other
structural intercompany receivables owed to the Senior Notes Issuer by the Parent (collectively, the “Topco Collateral”); and (b)
a second-ranking basis, by security over (i) the shares of the Company held by the Parent and (ii) structural intercompany
receivables owed to the Parent by the Company (if any) (collectively, the “Shared Collateral”). See “Description of the Senior
_Notes,” “Service of Process and Enforcement of Civil Liabilities” and “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_

(6) The Company, which will be a Guarantor of the Senior Notes and the Senior Secured Notes, is the top entity in the restricted group
under the Senior Secured Indenture and the direct parent of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer. Upon consummation of the Offering,
the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will on-loan the proceeds of the Senior Secured Notes Offering to the Company and enter into the
Senior Secured Proceeds Loan.

(7) The Senior Secured Notes Issuer is a private limited liability company incorporated under the laws of Jersey for the purpose of the
Transactions and other potential transactions and is not expected to engage in any activities other than those related to its formation,
the Transactions and other future transactions permitted by the Senior Secured Indenture. The Senior Secured Notes Issuer is a
wholly owned, direct subsidiary of the Company. The Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s only material assets and liabilities will be its
outstanding indebtedness under the Senior Secured Notes, the receivables under the Senior Secured Proceeds Loan, any other
future indebtedness and certain intercompany balances, and any other assets or liabilities that arise as a result of transactions not
prohibited by the Senior Secured Indenture. The Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s rights under the Senior Secured Proceeds Loan will
be assigned to the Security Agent and form part of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral.

(8) The Senior Secured Notes Issuer is offering $500,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of Dollar Senior Secured Notes and
€500,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of Euro Senior Secured Notes. The Senior Secured Notes will be general senior
obligations of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, will rank pari passu in right of payment with all of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s
existing and future indebtedness that is not expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Senior Secured Notes, will rank senior
in right of payment to all existing and future indebtedness of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer that is expressly subordinated in right
of payment to the Senior Secured Notes, will be effectively subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness of the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer that is secured by property and assets that do not secure the Senior Secured Notes, in each case to the extent
of the value of the property and assets securing such obligation or indebtedness.

Concurrently with the closing of the Offering, the initial purchasers will deposit the gross proceeds of the Senior Secured Notes
into one or more escrow accounts (the “Senior Secured Escrow Accounts”) in the names of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, but
controlled by the Escrow Agent pending funding under the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities, and pledged on a first-ranking
basis in favor of the Trustee on behalf of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes. Subject to and in accordance with the Agreed
Security Principles, the Senior Secured Notes will be guaranteed on the Escrow Release Date a senior basis by the Company and
by and the Subsidiary Guarantors on the terms described herein. The Senior Secured Guarantors will also guarantee (or otherwise
be obligors in respect of) the obligations under the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement on a senior basis.

Subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the Intercreditor Agreement and certain perfection requirements, the Senior Secured
Notes and the Senior Secured Note Guarantees will be secured, on a first-ranking basis, by security over the Shared Collateral and
the other Collateral and on the timeframes as further described in “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Security.”

(9) New subsidiaries that are wholly owned, direct subsidiaries of the Company will be incorporated in the Netherlands, Australia and
Delaware, the United States prior to the Escrow Release Date in connection with the Transactions to act as borrowers, or coborrowers, under certain of the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities (the “New SFA Borrowers”). The legal names of the SFA
Borrowers may be different once incorporated. Certain proceeds of the New EUR Term Facility and the New USD Term Facility
will be on-lent to the Company.

20


-----

(10) The SFA Borrowers, among others, are expected to enter into the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement on or prior to the
Escrow Release Date. The Guarantors (other than the Parent) will guarantee the Secured Credit Facilities on a pari passu basis
with the Senior Secured Note Guarantees (although any liabilities in respect of obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility will
have priority with respect to the application of the proceeds from the distressed disposal of, or enforcement of, the Collateral) and
on a senior basis to the Senior Note Guarantees. The Secured Credit Facilities and certain hedging obligations will be secured on
a first-priority basis by the Shared Collateral. See “Description of Other Indebtedness and Financing Arrangements—Senior
_Secured Credit Facilities Agreement.”_

(11) As of the date of this offering memorandum, we had a 100% interest in our subsidiaries other than as specified under “Business—
_Our Subsidiaries.” See also “Management.” The minority shareholders in our subsidiaries may receive certain distributions ahead_
of distributions made to holders of the Notes. From time to time, we have bought out and we may continue to buy out minority
interests as and when market opportunities are aligned with our business strategy. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our
_Financial Profile—Despite our substantial leverage, we may still be able to incur more debt under the Indenture governing the_
_Notes.” Further, the percentages set forth the respective economic rights in connection with a distribution or dividend on ordinary_
shares but are disapplied in circumstances in which a liquidity event may apply. See “Management—Management Equity Interests”
for information on these voting rights.

(12) We expect to receive an approximately £400 million promissory note receivable from the RP Entity as a portion of the consideration
for the Retail Transaction, which we expect to distribute to a parent entity of the Parent following the completion of the Retail
Transaction. The RP Entity is wholly owned by our shareholders and will, with Retail management, receive a 23% equity stake in
the Merged Business. See “—Recent Developments—Retail Transaction.”

**SUMMARY HISTORICAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION AND OTHER DATA**

_On May 31, 2022, The Ardonagh Group Limited, the entity at which we previously reported our results,_
_merged into the Group’s new indirect parent company, Tara Topco Limited. Following this merger, on_
_June 1, 2022, AGHL acquired Ardonagh New Midco 3 Limited, including the Group companies that_
_were previously owned by The Ardonagh Group Limited, and became the reporting entity for the Group._
_AGHL’s first reporting period included all transactions since its incorporation on December 8, 2021_
_to December 31, 2022. The nine-month period ended September 30, 2022, however, only includes four_
_months of the results of operations and cash flows of the consolidated operations of AGHL due to the_
_timing of the Tara Transactions. Accordingly, AGHL’s results during any period ended in 2022 are not_
_comparable to any other period presented. We have accounted for the Tara Transactions using the_
_acquisition method of accounting under IFRS 3, Business Combinations, applying purchase accounting_
_adjustments that resulted, among others, in the recognition of intangibles (including goodwill) and_
_deferred tax liabilities in our financial information. Due to the application of the acquisition method of_
_accounting, the Unaudited Interim Financial Statements of AGHL are not directly comparable to the_
_Audited Financial Statements of the Parent. See “Presentation of Financial Information—Differences_
_in the Financial Statements of AGHL and the Parent.”_

_To aid comparability between periods, the_ _following summary historical (i) consolidated statement of_
_financial position as of December 31, 2022 and the consolidated statement of profit or loss and_
_consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2022 have been derived from_
_the 2022 Audited Financial Statements of the Parent which have been prepared in accordance with_
_IFRS and are included elsewhere in this offering memorandum, (ii) consolidated statement of profit or_
_loss and consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2021 have been derived_
_from the 2021 Audited Financial Statements of the Parent which have been prepared in accordance_
_with IFRS and are included elsewhere in this offering memorandum, (iii) consolidated statement of_
_financial position as of December 31, 2021 have been derived from the comparative column in the_
_2022 Audited Financial Statements of the Parent, due to the restatement of trade and other receivables_
_and retained losses, (iv) consolidated statement of financial position as of December 31, 2020 and the_
_consolidated statement of profit or loss and consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended_
_December 30, 2020 have been derived from the comparative column in the 2021 Audited Financial_
_Statements of the Parent and (v) consolidated statement of profit or loss, consolidated statement of_
_financial position, and consolidated statement of cash flows as of and for the period ended September_
_30, 2022 and the nine months ended September 30, 2023 have been derived from the Unaudited Interim_
_Financial Statements of AGHL which have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 and are included_
_elsewhere in this offering memorandum._

_In addition, in September 2023, we announced the Retail Transaction. As a result of this merger and_
_the resulting disposal of the Retail platform, in our Unaudited Interim Financial Statements, we have_
_presented Retail as held for sale on our consolidated statement of financial position as of September_
_30, 2023 and as a discontinued operation on our consolidated statement of profit or loss and other_
_comprehensive income for the nine months period ended September 30, 2023 and the period ended_
_September 30, 2022. We have not restated or represented any other financial information as of or for_
_any other period for the impact of the Retail Transaction. See “Summary—Recent Developments—_
_Retail Transaction” and note 1 to the Unaudited Interim Financial Statements._

_Financial information of AGHL for the twelve months ended September 30, 2023 presented in the_
_following summary historical consolidated financial information was calculated by taking the results_
_of operations for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and adding it to the results of operations_
_of AGHL for the nine months ended September 30, 2023._ _The results of operations for the three months_
_ended December 31, 2022 extracted from the accounting records of AGHL have been adjusted to_
_present Retail as a discontinued operation for the purposes of calculating the financial information for_
_the twelve months ended September 30, 2023 presented herein. See “Presentation of Financial_
_Information—Comparability of the Financial Statements—The Retail Transaction.” The financial_

_information for the twelve months ended September 30, 2023 for AGHL is not necessarily indicative of_
_the results that may be expected for the year ended December 31, 2023 and should not be used as the_
_basis for or prediction of an annualized calculation. Such financial information is a non-IFRS measure._

_We also present certain unaudited financial information on an as adjusted basis to give effect to the_
_Transactions and the Retail Transaction, and the application of the proceeds therefrom, including on_
_our cash and cash equivalents and capitalization as if such transactions had occurred on September_
_30, 2023 and on our interest expense as if such transactions had occurred on October 1, 2022. The as_
_adjusted financial information has been prepared for illustrative purposes only and does not represent_
_what our debt, cash and cash equivalents and capitalization would have been had such transactions_
_occurred on September 30, 2023, or what our interest expense would have been had such transactions_
_occurred on October 1, 2022, nor does it purport to project our debt cash and cash equivalents and_
_capitalization or interest expense at any future date. This as adjusted financial information has not been_
_prepared in accordance with IFRS. Neither the assumptions underlying such adjustments nor the_
_resulting as adjusted financial information have been audited or reviewed in accordance with any_
_generally accepted auditing or review standards._

_Unless the context otherwise requires, all references herein to “we,” “our,” “us,” “Group” and_
_“Ardonagh” with respect to any financial information in this offering memorandum are to (i) the_
_Company and its consolidated subsidiaries for any period ended on or prior to December 31, 2022 and_

_after December 31, 2022._

_measures. You should read the information summarized below in conjunction with the information_
_contained in “Presentation of Financial Information,” “Use of Proceeds,” “Capitalization,”_

_____________

(1) On May 31, 2022, The Ardonagh Group Limited, the entity at which we previously reported our results, merged into the Group’s
new indirect parent company, Tara Topco Limited. Following this merger, on June 1, 2022, AGHL acquired Ardonagh New Midco
3 Limited, including the Group companies that were previously owned by The Ardonagh Group Limited, and became the reporting
entity for the Group. AGHL’s first reporting period included all transactions since its incorporation on December 8, 2021 to
December 31, 2022, but only includes four months of the results of operations and cash flows of the consolidated operations of
AGHL due to the timing of the Tara Transactions. In order to present meaningfully comparable financial information, we present
the financial information of (i) the Company for the years ended 2020, 2021 and 2022 and (ii) AGHL for the nine months ended
September 30, 2023 and the twelve months ended September 30, 2023 in this table. See “Presentation of Financial Information”
and note 1 to the Unaudited Interim Financial Statements.

(2) The consolidated statement of profit and loss of AGHL for the period ended September 30, 2022 includes all transactions from the
incorporation of AGHL on December 8, 2021 to September 30, 2022, but only includes four months of the results of operations of
the consolidated operations of AGHL due to the timing of the Tara Transactions. As a result of the limited comparability between
the consolidated statement of profit and loss of AGHL for the period ended September 30, 2022 and the nine months ended 2023,
we have not presented the consolidated statement of profit and loss of AGHL for the period ended September 30, 2022 in this table.
See “Presentation of Financial Information” and notes 1 and 26 to the Unaudited Interim Financial Statements.

(3) As a result of the Retail Transaction, Retail is presented as a discontinued operation in the consolidated statement of loss and other
comprehensive income in the financial information of AGHL for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and the twelve months
ended September 30, 2023, and therefore excluded from the results presented in the above table. See “Presentation of Financial
_Information” and note 26 to the Unaudited Interim Financial Statements._

(4) In the 2022 Audited Financial Statements, the Parent changed the presentation of investment income and it is now presented as
part of finance income. This change in presentation was reflected also in the comparative period. As such, the line items investment
income, operating profit and finance income for the year ended 31 December 2021 included in this offering memorandum and
derived from the 2021 Audited Financial Statements differ from the same line items in the 2021 comparative column in the 2022
Audited Financial Statements. The information for the year ended December 31, 2020 also does not reflect this change in
presentation.

(1) On May 31, 2022, The Ardonagh Group Limited, the entity at which we previously reported our results, merged into the Group’s
new indirect parent company, Tara Topco Limited. Following this merger, on June 1, 2022, AGHL acquired Ardonagh New Midco
3 Limited, including the Group companies that were previously owned by The Ardonagh Group Limited, and became the reporting
entity for the Group. AGHL’s first reporting period included all transactions since its incorporation on December 8, 2021 to
December 31, 2022, but only includes four months of the results of operations and cash flows of the consolidated operations of
AGHL due to the timing of the Tara Transactions. In order to present meaningfully comparable financial information, we present
the financial information of (i) the Company for the years ended 2020, 2021 and 2022 and (ii) AGHL for the period ended
September 30, 2022, the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and the twelve months ended September 30, 2022. See
“Presentation of Financial Information” and note 1 to the Unaudited Interim Financial Statements.

(2) The consolidated statement of cash flows of AGHL for the period ended September 30, 2022 includes all transactions from the
incorporation of AGHL on December 8, 2021 to September 30, 2022, but only includes four months of the results of operations
and cash flows of the consolidated operations of AGHL due to the timing of the Tara Transactions. As a result of the limited
comparability between the consolidated statement of cash flows of AGHL for the period ended September 30, 2022 and the nine
months ended 2023, we have not presented the consolidated statement of cash flows of AGHL for the period ended September 30,
2022 in this table. See “Presentation of Financial Information” and notes 1 and 26 to the Unaudited Interim Financial Statements.

(3) See note (3) under “—Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss” above, “Presentation of Financial Information” and notes 1 and
26 to the Unaudited Interim Financial Statements.

(4) We define profit from disposal of assets as the disposal of property, plant and equipment, right-of-use assets and intangible assets.

(5) We define foreign exchange movements as gains/losses arising on the revaluation of monetary items (debtors, creditors, cash, etc.)
and on derivatives to which hedge accounting has not been applied.

(6) We define MSA recharge as group management services charges which cover the transaction costs associated with previous
refinancing or capital structuring projects.

(7) The adjustment for transformational hires includes the removal of costs for hiring new teams or individual employees with
experience from industries or product lines in which the Group does not have existing operations. It includes costs associated with
buying out new hires of existing contracts, bonus schemes, sign-on deals and any net losses associated with new joiners who have
annual salaries of at least £80,000 (or the equivalent in jurisdictions outside the United Kingdom) up to the first year after any
capacity or covenant restriction.

(8) The adjustment for business transformation costs includes the removal of certain costs incurred in achieving synergies from
enhancing existing business processes, such as restructuring and investing in new systems, cost savings and process improvements.

(9) The adjustment for legacy costs includes the removal of the costs associated with resolving legacy issues within the Group that are
not related to the Group’s current trading activity and have been corrected over time. The amount of adjustments related to legacy
costs has reduced period-on-period during the periods presented.

(10) We define other costs as costs that are outside of the normal course of business, including (i) costs incurred in 2020 and 2021 that
are directly attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic that would not have been incurred otherwise, (ii) professional fee relating to a
transaction involving an equity investment into The Ardonagh Group Limited, including post-deal advice to the Group’s investors
in relation to non-cash MIPs; and (iii) non-cash MIP and share based payment charged in the Ireland P&C segment of the Global
P&C platform relating to Arachas.

(11) We define regulatory costs as costs associated with one-off regulatory reviews and with changes in the regulatory and compliance
environments.

(12) We define acquisition and financing costs as costs associated with acquiring businesses, with disposing of parts of the business,
with raising additional financing (legal and accounting advisors, rating agencies, etc.), and with a change in the value of contingent
consideration (after the measurement period has ended).

(13) Pro Forma for Completed Transactions are adjustments to give pro forma effect to (i) all acquisitions completed during the period,
and (ii) financing transactions, in each case, as if they had occurred on the first day of the period.

(14) Pro Forma for Q4 2023 Completed Transactions (including AccuRisk Disposal) are adjustments to give pro forma effect to (i) all
material acquisitions completed between October 1, 2023 and December 31, 2023, including certain cost and procurement
synergies, and (ii) the disposal of AccuRisk following its sale in the fourth quarter of 2023, in each case, as if they had occurred
on the first day of the period.

(15) Pro Forma for Q4 2023 Organic Growth adjusts for organic growth for the three months ended December 31, 2023, calculated as
the Adjusted EBITDA contribution for the three months ended December 30, 2023 less the Adjusted EBITDA contribution for the
three months ended December 31, 2022, in each case, on a constant perimeter basis as of September 30, 2023. See “—Recent
_Developments—Trading Update.”_

(16) Pro Forma for Cost savings and synergies (excluding AccuRisk) comprises acquisition synergies and operational efficiencies across
the Group. Approximately 56% of this adjustment relates to annualizing the impact of benefits not yet realized from initiatives that
have already been completed as if they had already been realized on the first day of the period. The remaining adjustment reflects
the benefits of initiatives are in process and expected to be completed within 12 months as if they had already been realized on the
first day of the period.

(17) Pro Forma for Completed Acquisitions (post-December 31, 2023) are adjustments to give pro forma effect to all material
acquisitions completed between January 1, 2024 and February 1, 2024, including certain cost and procurement synergies as if they
had occurred on the first day of the period.

(18) Pro Forma Transactions under LOI are adjustments that give pro forma effect to 36 acquisitions across Europe, Australia, Brazil,
the United Kingdom and Ireland that are contractually committed or subject to a signed letter of intent and at an advanced stage of
negotiations as of February 1, 2024, expected to complete by the end of the second quarter of 2024, including expected cost and
procurement synergies, as if they had occurred on the first day of the period.

(19) This adjustment reflects the EBITDA contribution of producer hires, who have not yet reached maturity, assuming their production
at 100% maturity, net of assumed bonuses. We estimate the expected contribution of transformational hires at maturity based on
the investment case with a 25% haircut at the time of the respective addition to the business and adjusted following regular
subsequent sensitivity assessments on a team-by-team basis based on performance and market conditions. In the twelve months

46


-----

ended September 30, 2023, we had (i) seven teams hired in 2020 at a maturity of 75%; (ii) seven teams hired in 2021 at a maturity
of 58%; (iii) seven teams hired in 2022 at a maturity of 37%; and (iv) eight teams hired in 2023 who were in the restriction period.

(20) This adjustment reflects contribution from (i) completed enhanced and alternative capacity arrangements in place to better serve
our existing customers (the costs of which have already been included in our consolidated statement of profit or loss and other
comprehensive income) and (ii) further enhanced and alternative capacity arrangements (the costs of which have already been
included in our consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income) that have already been implemented but
are not yet at maturity, as if they had been fully mature during the period.

**RISK FACTORS**

_You should carefully consider the following risk factors together with all the other information included_
_in this offering memorandum before purchasing the Notes. The risks below are not the only risks we_
_face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently consider_
_immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business or operations. Any of the following_
_risks could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations_
_and our ability to service our debt, including the Notes._

**Risks Related to Our Business and Industry**

**_Our business may be adversely affected by a decline in economic conditions in the United Kingdom_**
**_or globally and by other market risks._**

We generate a significant portion of our revenues in the United Kingdom. As a result, we are particularly
affected by economic developments and regulatory and political changes in the United Kingdom and
are also affected by any similar developments across Europe or markets globally that may impact
economic conditions in the United Kingdom or in other markets in which we operate. Economic
difficulties, increased competition between insurers due to economic downturns and other factors may
cause the premium rates on which our commissions are based to decline. In addition, any significant
reduction or delay by customers in purchasing insurance or making payment of premiums could have a
negative impact on our business. Factors such as declining business and consumer confidence, lower
household income and consumer spending, inflation, downturns in the property market and other
economic challenges could have a significant negative impact on the buying behavior of our commercial
and individual customers. Insolvencies associated with continuing economic uncertainty could
adversely affect our business through the loss of customers or by hindering our ability to place
insurance. Due to their size, our SME business customers may be more vulnerable to any economic
downturn and may be more prone to insolvency than larger commercial customers.

Despite an improvement in global economic conditions in 2021 and 2022 following the sharp global
economic downturn in 2020 resulting from the first waves of the COVID-19 pandemic, as of the date
of this offering memorandum, the outlook for the global economy remains highly uncertain, and certain
markets, including Europe, may not achieve the growth rates that they have forecasted or historically
observed. Such uncertainty has been exacerbated by rising global turmoil resulting from the ongoing
conflict between Russia and Ukraine. In particular, the Russia-Ukraine conflict has resulted in severe
political, social and economic consequences in the countries directly involved in the conflict as well as
more broadly on the European continent, as tensions between Russia, the European Union, the United
States, the United Kingdom and other countries continue to increase. The ongoing war in Ukraine has
also been a driver behind a surge in energy and transportation prices in 2022, which has been, and may
continue to be, a key factor in driving inflationary pressures and may ultimately adversely affect general
economic conditions and in turn our results of operations. Separately, in early October 2023, Hamas
and Israel began an armed conflict which may potentially spread to surrounding Middle Eastern
countries. The length, outcome and consequences of the Hamas-Israel military conflict remain highly
unpredictable. We are unable to predict the short- or long-term implications of these conflicts, which
could include but are not limited to further sanctions, uncertainty about economic and political stability,
increases in inflation rates and energy prices, supply chain challenges and adverse effects on currency
exchange rates and financial markets. The tensions arising from the Russian invasion of Ukraine and a
potential escalation of the ongoing military confrontation between Israel and Hamas could also further
increase other political tensions and hamper international trade. A new economic recession, energy and
logistics issues, further political and economic instability and escalating geopolitical tensions in Europe
or globally could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products, our business and our
results of operations.

Supply and labor market disruptions caused by various factors, such as the COVID-19 pandemic,
accommodative monetary and fiscal policy, have contributed to significant inflation in many of the

51


-----

markets in which we operate. In addition to inflation contributing to reductions or delays by customers
in purchasing insurance or making payment of premiums, inflation impacts the costs to attract and retain
employees and other costs to run and invest in our business. If our costs grow significantly in excess of
our ability to raise revenues, our margins and results of operations may be materially and adversely
impacted and we may not be able to achieve our strategic and financial objectives. Furthermore, while
our fees are generally calculated as a percentage of transactions, and as such increase proportionally
with inflation, inflation could cause clients to request flat fees.

Any future developments in respect of the COVID-19 pandemic or any other future outbreak of another
virus or other contagious disease are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope and
duration of an outbreak and actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response
thereto, including further quarantine measures. A resurgence in COVID-19 or any future outbreak of
another virus or other contagious disease may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations, financial condition and prospects.

Any of the aforementioned factors, individually or in the aggregate, that negatively impact the UK
insurance market, the UK economy more generally, or European or global economic growth and
stability more generally could increase our operating costs and impose additional regulatory burdens
and could also have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial
condition. If a significant insurer fails or withdraws from writing certain insurance coverage that we
offer our clients, overall underwriting capacity in the industry could be negatively affected, which could
reduce our placement of certain lines and types of insurance. An insurer with whom we place business
ceasing to operate could also result in errors and omissions claims by our clients. This or any other
negative economic developments in the United Kingdom could reduce customer confidence or limit the
demand for our insurance products and as a result could negatively affect earnings and have a material
adverse effect on our results of operations.

**_Volatility or declines in premiums, declines in commission rates or increases in applicable premium_**
**_taxes may seriously undermine our business and results of operations._**

We derive most of our revenue from commission and fees for broking and underwriting services. Our
commissions are generally based on insurance premiums, which are cyclical in nature and may vary
widely based on market conditions. Competition, economic difficulties, changes in the insurance
premium tax or other factors may change the underlying cost bases of insurance providers and as a
result may cause premium rates to decline. As we cannot determine the timing and extent of premium
rate changes, we may not be able to accurately forecast our commission income, including whether it
will significantly decline. As insurance companies continue to outsource the issuance of insurance
policies to non-affiliated agents and brokers such as ourselves, they may seek to further bring down
their expenses by reducing commission rates payable to such organizations. Additionally, changes in
the manner in which discount rates or other rates related to claims costs are calculated could result in
the rates rising or falling and could lead insurers to adjust commission rates. A significant reduction in
commissions, along with general volatility or declines in premiums, could have a significant adverse
effect on our business, our generation of revenue and our financial condition. Profit commissions are
less predictable than traditional commission and we are consequently less able to forecast the amount
of profit commissions that we will receive. On a longer time horizon, the insurance markets might be
disrupted by new technologies, “open finance” or new distribution structures, which may give rise to
both risks and opportunities for us.

We derive a small portion of our income from profit commissions from insurance companies. Profit
commissions are typically dependent upon the profitability of the business placed with the insurer. We
are less able to forecast profit commissions than premium-based commissions due to the link with
variable insurance events and the inherent volatility this brings. As the profitability of our MGA division
is in part dependent upon the ratio of claims made to total underwriting business placed, and as a
significant amount of the underwriting business that we place insures risk in the United Kingdom,

52


-----

catastrophic events, whether natural or otherwise, may affect the amount of claims being made and
therefore the profitability of the business which we placed. Insurance companies may also seek to
negotiate profit sharing agreements with less favorable terms to us as a result of a decrease in the
profitability of the business we place with them. Furthermore, we have a significant amount of trade
accounts receivable from some of the insurance companies with which we place insurance. If those
third-parties experience liquidity problems or other financial difficulties, there is a risk we could
encounter delays or defaults in payments owed to us. If we are unable to correctly forecast the amount
of profit commissions that we will receive for the above or any other reasons, results of operations,
financial condition and cash flows could be negatively impacted.

**_We may not be able to fully realize our commercial and strategic vision._**

We may experience difficulties in maximizing collaboration across our portfolio of businesses,
including taking advantage of cross-selling opportunities, and may incur higher than expected costs or
may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of acquisition, transformation and integration activity.
Achieving operational efficiencies across our portfolio may involve unforeseen difficulties and may
require a disproportionate amount of our management’s attention or of our financial and other resources.
While we have generated certain operational efficiencies in the past and believe we can continue to
generate such efficiencies, we can provide no assurance that we will realize our goals in a timely manner
or at all. Furthermore, while we believe that expected operational efficiencies from recent and planned
acquisitions are based on reasonable assumptions and diligence, actual developments may differ
significantly from our expectations. The failure to achieve our vision in terms of collaboration across
the businesses could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

As part of our business strategy, we have identified and continue to identify opportunities to improve
profitability by reducing costs and enhancing productivity. Some of our ongoing initiatives focus on
streamlining and automating back-office processes, capitalizing on ongoing synergies and identifying
cost-savings while integrating new businesses. We have, for example, retained specialist IT services
provider Mphasis to deliver tailored infrastructure services across various parts of The Ardonagh Group,
and are in the process of transitioning to cloud-based data centers and a cloud-based core finance
platform, which we believe will contribute to ongoing operating efficiencies across our businesses. Any
operational efficiencies, cost-savings or optimization of middle- and back-office functions that we
expect to realize from such efforts may differ materially from our estimates. In addition, any synergies,
cost-savings or productivity enhancements that we realize may be offset, in whole or in part, by
reductions in income or through increases in other expenses. We can provide no assurance that these
initiatives will be completed as anticipated or that the benefits we expect will be achieved on a timely
basis or at all. Our calculation of Total Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA includes adjustments for cost
savings expected to be realized from these initiatives and cost savings in respect of companies that we
have acquired or have committed to acquire. Although we believe these estimates and assumptions are
reasonable, investors should not place undue reliance upon the calculation of Total Pro Forma Adjusted
EBITDA given how it is calculated and the possibility that the underlying estimates and assumptions
may ultimately not reflect actual results. See also “—The unaudited pro forma financial information
_presented herein is inherently subject to risks and uncertainties.”_

**_Our selective acquisition and disposal strategy exposes us to risks, including the risk that we may not_**
**_be able to successfully integrate acquired businesses or that acquisitions may have liabilities that we_**
**_are not aware of and may not be as profitable as we may have expected them to be, and that disposals_**
**_may not have the impact on results of operations that we expected them to have._**

We intend to continue to selectively pursue further strategic and financially accretive acquisitions and
disposals of businesses, assets or insurance books when and where opportunities exist and fit with our
corporate culture, existing operational platform and overall strategy. We may also acquire noncontrolling stakes or enter into joint ventures with other players if we believe such transactions to be
conducive to the achievement of our strategy. The success of our strategy is dependent upon our ability

53


-----

to identify suitable acquisition and disposal targets, conduct appropriate due diligence, negotiate
transactions on favorable terms, obtain required authorizations and ultimately complete such
transactions and integrate the acquired businesses into The Ardonagh Group or reorganize operations
following a disposal. We cannot ensure that we will be able to identify attractive acquisition or disposal
candidates or complete the acquisition or disposal of any identified candidates at favorable prices and
upon advantageous terms.

In order to pursue our acquisition strategy, we require financing and we may not have the financial
resources necessary to consummate acquisitions or make the necessary investments in acquired
businesses or have the ability to obtain the necessary funds on satisfactory terms. In addition to the
initial cost of acquisitions, acquisition targets may require substantial capital expenditures to bring them
up to our standards. General economic conditions or unfavorable global capital and credit markets could
limit the number of financial institutions that are willing to provide financing to companies in our
industry or affect the cost of such financing, which could affect the timing and extent to which we
successfully acquire or dispose of such targets.

Even if we are successful in acquiring target businesses, we may experience difficulties in integrating
targets into our business, incur higher than expected costs or fail to realize the anticipated benefits or
synergies. Attempting to integrate acquired companies may involve unforeseen difficulties and may
require a disproportionate amount of our management’s attention or of our financial and other resources.
In addition, the process of integrating acquisitions may also be disruptive to our operations, as a result
of, among other things, unforeseen legal, regulatory, contractual (including, for instance,
representations and warranties, indemnities, put and call options) and other issues, difficulties in
realizing operating synergies, difficulties in integrating diverse business cultures which may be
incompatible, problems in integrating IT or other systems between the businesses, disagreements with
joint venture partners or minority shareholders or a failure to maintain the quality of services that we
have historically provided. Such transactions may also disrupt our relationships with current and new
employees, customers, capacity partners and industry colleagues. Our acquisitions may also subject us
to more expansive or new regulatory frameworks, new customer segments with different habits than we
have catered to and/or new competitive dynamics which could hinder our growth and frustrate the
realization of our acquisition objectives.

Although we always conduct due diligence investigations prior to each acquisition, we can provide no
assurance that we will discover all operational deficiencies or material liabilities of an acquired business
for which we may be responsible as a successor owner or operator and actual performance and
developments may differ significantly from our expectations or forecasts. Our assessments of
acquisition targets may prove to be incorrect, particularly our expectations with respect to growth,
financial margins, cash flows and cost and revenue synergies. Additionally, acquisitions may require
the approval of governmental or regulatory authorities which can block, impose conditions on or delay
the acquisition process, resulting in a failure on our part to proceed with announced transactions on a
timely basis or at all, thus hampering our opportunities for growth.

We believe that our corporate culture, including our management philosophy, has been a critical
component to our success and that our culture creates an environment that drives and perpetuates our
overall business strategy. We have invested substantial time and resources in building our team and we
expect to continue to hire as we expand in both the United Kingdom and internationally. As we grow
and mature and grow internationally, we may find it difficult to maintain our corporate culture. Any
failure to preserve our culture could negatively affect our future success, including our ability to recruit
and retain personnel and effectively focus on and pursue our business strategy.

Any acquisition or other strategic transaction we may undertake in the future could result in the
incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities, an increase in interest expenses and amortisation expenses
related to goodwill or other intangible assets or in the use by us of available cash on hand to finance
any such acquisitions. In identifying acquisition targets we may incorrectly assess the market position,

54


-----

growth prospects or underwriting performance of the target business, or whether the business’
geographic, distribution channel or product mix fits within our existing operations. We may incorrectly
assess the commission and fee income streams of the target business, as well as the potential to increase
such streams following the acquisition, upon which the price paid for acquisitions is primarily based.
Although we conduct due diligence with respect to the business and operations of acquired businesses,
we may fail to identify all material facts concerning these businesses. Unanticipated events or liabilities
relating to these businesses could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial
condition and cash flow. Such failures to achieve our acquisition target performance goals and could in
turn have material adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations. See
also “The Retail Transaction may be delayed or may not proceed to completion.”

**_The Retail Transaction may be delayed or may not proceed to completion._**

The Retail Transaction is subject to, and can only occur, upon the satisfaction or (where applicable)
waiver of certain conditions under the Retail SPA including, without limitation, the receipt of regulatory
approvals (including the approval of the Retail Transaction by the FCA under section 178 FSMA) and
the CMA determining not to refer the Retail Transaction to Phase 2 (whether unconditionally or
conditional on the CMA acceptance of undertakings in lieu (“UILs”) or, in the event that a reference to
Phase 2 is made, concluding either that the Retail Transaction may not be expected to result in a
substantial lessening of competition (“SLC”) within any market in the UK or that the CMA accepts
final undertakings which it decides remedy that SLC, which are outside of our control.

While the parties to the Retail SPA have obligations in relation to the satisfaction of the conditions
under the Retail SPA, there can be no assurance that all of the conditions will be satisfied or waived (as
applicable) by the Retail SPA Long Stop Date unless extended. The Retail SPA contains covenants and
agreements applicable to the Retail Group prior to completion of the Retail Transaction. Any failure on
the part of the Retail Seller to comply with any of its obligations under the Retail SPA could result in
the completion of the Retail Transaction being delayed or not taking place at all. Moreover, while the
Retail Purchaser has demonstrated it has funds available to finance the cash consideration under the
Retail SPA, in the event that the Retail Purchaser does not have sufficient funding to satisfy the cash
consideration at completion, completion of the Retail Transaction may not proceed even if all conditions
under the Retail SPA have been satisfied or waived and there can be no assurance that we would be
able to recover any losses as a result thereof. Therefore, Retail Transaction may be delayed or may not
complete at all.

If the Retail Transaction does not proceed to completion, we will not receive the expected proceeds
from the Retail Transaction and there is no guarantee that we would be able to enter into any other
transaction on favorable terms or at all. Any failure to complete the Retail Transaction may negatively
impact the perceived value of the Retail Business and could increase the risk that the value of the Retail
Business may decrease over time if the Group is not able to invest the resources necessary to drive and
to deliver the growth potential of the Retail Business. In addition, if the Retail Transaction does not
proceed to completion, our ratio of as adjusted total net debt to Total Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA
would be 5.8x, as calculated by adjusting as adjusted total net debt to remove the net proceeds from the
Retail Transaction, including Retail Total EBITDA, and adding Lease Liabilities associated with the
Retail Divestiture. We have also incurred significant costs in connection with the Retail Transaction
that we will be responsible for paying irrespective of whether the Retail Transaction completes.

**_The entry into new geographies and markets exposes us to risks._**

Our expansion and growth may, from time to time, lead us to start operating in geographies or markets
where we currently have little or no presence to increase the size and geographic scope of our operations
or to pursue growth and/or other opportunities. We have in recent years strengthened our international
operations and global reach and have entered into new markets such as Australia, the Netherlands,
Portugal, Brazil, Greece, and Switzerland. We have a robust M&A pipeline (85% of which consists of

55


-----

targets outside of the United Kingdom), and we continue to explore larger transaction opportunities
globally with a strong focus on market-leading platforms.

Our expansion may introduce dependencies on new market conditions in new geographical locations.
A broader geographical distribution of our business portfolio may also result in additional costs in
connection with the management of our businesses and reduce the benefits of economies of scale. The
occurrence of any of the foregoing factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

Our entry into new geographies and markets may entail numerous risks, including:

- changes in laws and regulations with a significant impact on our business, our products and our
operations;

- competition with established competitors in new markets, who may have greater knowledge of
those markets and/or resources to expend in those markets than we do;

- difficulties in understanding and adapting to local cultural norms, including, but not limited to,
consumption patterns, seasonal effects, consumer trends and preferences, as well seasonal
effects;

- diversion of management’s attention and difficulties in staffing and managing global operations
and the increased travel, infrastructure, and legal compliance costs;

- certain other risks involved in entering markets in which we have limited or no prior experience;
and

- reputational and other risks regarding our ability to enter new geographies or markets
successfully, including obtaining financing which could result in an increase in our
indebtedness.

We have also recently entered the reinsurance market. In 2021, we launched Inver Re, a new reinsurance
broker. As a new player in the reinsurance market, we may face strong competition from established
players. In addition, the lack of strong barriers to entry into the reinsurance business means that we may
compete with new companies that may be formed to enter the insurance and reinsurance markets. We
may also experience increased competition as a result of the consolidation in the reinsurance industry.
Competition in the types of reinsurance that we underwrite is based on many factors, including the
perceived and relative financial strength, pricing and other terms and conditions, services provided,
ratings assigned by independent rating agencies, speed of claims payment, geographic scope of
business, reputation and experience in the lines of business to be written. If competitive pressures reduce
our prices, we would expect to write less business. In addition, competition for customers would become
more intense and we could incur additional expenses relating to customer acquisition and retention,
further reducing our operating margins. Furthermore, insurance-linked securities, derivatives and other
non-traditional risk transfer mechanisms and alternative vehicles are being developed and offered by
other parties, which could impact the demand for traditional insurance or reinsurance. A number of
new, proposed or potential industry or legislative developments could further increase competition in
the reinsurance industry. New competition from these developments could cause the demand for
reinsurance to fall or the expense of customer acquisition and retention to increase, either of which
could have a material adverse effect on our growth and profitability. As a result of new and alternative
capital inflows into the industry and cedants retaining more business, there is an excess supply of
reinsurance capital which is also driving pricing lower and putting pressure on terms and conditions.
See also “—Competition in our industry is intense, and if we are unable to compete effectively, our
_business may be adversely affected.”_

Any failure to successfully enter new geographies or markets could have a material adverse effect on
our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, there can be no assurance that
we will be able to identify suitable geographies or markets.

**_The loss of key personnel could negatively affect our financial results and impair our ability to_**
**_implement our business strategy._**

Our success substantially depends on our ability to attract and retain key members of our senior
management team and key leaders throughout our platforms. If we were to lose one or more of these
key employees, we may not be able to replace them on a timely basis with other professionals capable
of making comparable contributions to the business, and our ability to successfully implement our
business plan and the value of the business could be adversely affected. We maintain what we believe
to be a comprehensive range of staff retention and incentive mechanisms, but we can provide no
assurances that we will not lose one or more key members of the senior management team or key leaders
in any of our platforms.

**_Disruption to our infrastructure, interruption or loss of our information systems, including our data_**
**_integrity or other digital distribution channels or a failure to maintain secure information systems_**
**_could have a material adverse effect on our business._**

Our success depends, in part, on our ability to develop and implement technology solutions that
anticipate and keep pace with changes in industry information technology (“IT”) platforms, industry
standards, client preferences and internal control standards, and our capacity to service our customers
depends in part on storing, retrieving, processing and managing information. We may not be successful
in anticipating or responding to these developments on a timely and cost-effective basis. We can provide
no assurance that our IT infrastructure and software systems, or the IT infrastructure of our third-party
service providers will not be disrupted or interrupted. An interruption to or loss of our information
processing capabilities through the loss of stored data, a failure of our computer equipment or software
or telecommunications systems or some other technology disruption could have a material adverse
effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Disruptions may include terrorist
activities, disease pandemics, war or military activity, or disruption to the electrical, communications
or other services used by our company, our employees or third parties with whom we conduct business.
While we have developed a disaster recovery plan for our IT services as well as our cloud-based IT data
center, there can be no assurance that in the event of a disaster our systems will be fully effective.

We rely on (“PCWs”) to distribute certain of our products and are as such exposed to interruptions to
the processing systems in the services provided by PCWs. We are also dependent on certain third parties
to enable us to complete transactions relating to the pricing and placement of insurance products. A
significant failure of any of our platforms or any of these third parties could have a negative impact on
our ability to service our customer and complete transactions, could have a material adverse impact on
our financial control frameworks and our ability to carry out our internal financial processes.

Our computer systems store information about our customers, some of which is sensitive personal data.
Database privacy, identity theft and related computer and internet issues are matters of growing public
concern and are subject to changes in rules and regulations. Any failure to adhere to or successfully
implement processes in response to changing regulatory requirements in this area could result in legal
liability or harm to our reputation. Unauthorized data disclosure could occur through cyber security
breaches, as a result of human error, external hacking, malware infection, malicious or accidental user
activity, internal security breaches and physical security breaches, among others, and we are exposed
to increased risk of data compromise when our employees work from home due to such employees
being outside the office environment and are unable to be supervised in person. Some of our businesses
have in the past had weak cyber security controls. In particular, with the growing incidence of hacking
and other forms of cyberattacks, our IT systems and networks have been, and may in the future be,
subject to malicious attacks, including cyber-attacks or the deliberate, accidental or negligent insertion

57


-----

of software viruses or other malicious code, any of which may disrupt or interrupt their normal
operation, prevent access to data, cause data loss or corruption, result in the unauthorized distribution
of data, including customer or employee data, damage or destroy some or all of our systems or cause
unexpected shutdowns.

We may be from time to time subject to, and our business may be vulnerable to, cybercrime attacks,
such as attempts to gain unauthorized access to, or deliberately breach, our IT systems and networks in
order, for example, to manipulate our proprietary business data or customer information, theft of data,
and even incidents that do not amount to a breach could result in adverse regulatory and financial
consequences including breaches of the Data Protection Act 2018 and the General Data Protection
Regulation (the “GDPR”), as well as further regulatory intervention, and could harm our reputation.
Such attacks are technologically sophisticated and may be difficult or impossible to detect and defend
against. Despite the security measures that we have implemented to prevent unauthorized access to
information stored in our database and to comply with relevant data protection regulations, our
technology may fail to adequately protect the private information we maintain in our databases from
theft or inadvertent leakage.

In addition, the transition of our employees to working from home increases data compromise risk due
to such employees being outside the office environment and are unable to be supervised in-person. See
“—Regulation or other requirements in the areas of privacy, information security and data protection
_could increase our costs and affect or limit how we collect and/or use personal information and our_
_business opportunities.”_

If unauthorized parties do gain access to our networks or databases, they may be able to steal, publish,
delete or modify private and sensitive third-party information, and misuse could include committing
fraud and identity theft. In such circumstances, we may be held liable to our clients or may be subject
to regulatory actions for breaching privacy rules. In addition, our reputation may be harmed. This, in
turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Furthermore, the failure of any of the PCWs that distribute our products or other third-party IT solutions
that support distribution of our products and services to maintain secure information systems could
result in customers associating our products or brands with such failures, which could have a negative
impact on our reputation and brand. Any resultant litigation, civil penalties, government investigations
or adverse publicity could cause us to incur expenses to resolve these issues, could deter intermediaries
and customers from dealing with us or could damage our reputation more broadly.

**_We continue to implement IT initiatives in order to realize internal efficiencies and deliver scale_**
**_advantages across our business, often in reliance on third-parties. Any adverse challenges to our_**
**_implementation of new technologies, systems or processes could have a material adverse effect on_**
**_our business._**

Although we have been successful in realizing benefits from our IT initiatives, we can provide no
assurance that we will realize all of the benefits of our various IT initiatives, including increasing costsavings or achieving synergies between our various divisions. For example, we have partnered with
Mphasis to deliver tailored infrastructure service across various parts of The Ardonagh Group while
leveraging Microsoft’s Azure cloud platform across several applications. Any or all of the composite
segments of the program may be delayed, be more expensive than we may have expected or may not
result in the same IT efficiencies, synergies or costs savings for some offices, product markets, or
regions as for others, if at all. The installation of certain technologies or systems may prove difficult for
our staff to fully utilize such that the expected benefits are not fully realized, if realized at all.
Implementation of any IT initiatives may distract management’s attention from other aspects of the
business, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

In addition, we have outsourced certain financial and other functions to third-party service providers,
including Microsoft and Mphasis, in an effort to maximize operating efficiencies. Inadequate

58


-----

management or training of any of these providers could lead to an inability to effectively manage and
execute the applicable processes. We are at risk of data security breaches, losing visibility and control
of the applicable processes and potential language barriers. Furthermore, the IT platforms for our
premium financing are provided by various premium credit providers, including third parties, and thus
we have no control and can provide no assurances with respect to risk of data breaches on this platform.
See “—Regulation or other requirements in the areas of privacy, information security and data
_protection could increase our costs and affect or limit how we collect and/or use personal information_
_and our business opportunities.” If we do not effectively manage outsourcing relationships, if third-_
party providers do not perform efficiently or in a timely manner or if we experience problems with
transitioning work to a third-party provider, we may experience disruptions in transaction processing
or IT services. Furthermore, to the extent that any of the third-party service provider agreements are
determined not to benefit us in their current form, we may not be able to renegotiate or rescind any or
all of the agreements. If any of the above risks were to materialize, it could negatively impact our
business processes, reputation and customers.

The various technologies, systems, processes and third-party relationships that comprise our IT
initiatives are intended to operate in a complementary manner, connecting our offices, standardizing
our systems and processes and capitalizing on scale advantages across our business. There is a risk that
if any one or more individual IT initiatives proves difficult to implement, does not become fully
integrated or does not achieve all expected results, the full integration and expected performance of
other specific IT initiatives, as well as the impact of the IT initiatives taken as a whole, may be adversely
affected. See also “—Disruption to our infrastructure, interruption or loss of our information systems,
_including our data integrity, a failure of PCWs or other digital distribution channels or a failure to_
_maintain secure information systems could have a material adverse effect on our business.”_

The success of our business depends in large part on our ability to achieve operational efficiency which
we believe our IT initiatives support, but any of the abovementioned obstacles to the successful
implementation of our IT initiatives, or any other challenges to the improvement and integration of our
IT systems across our IT platforms and companies, may have a material adverse effect on our business,
results of operations and financial condition.

**_We depend on relationships with third-party brokers, third-party MGAs and other capacity and_**
**_product providers._**

Our success depends in part on the quality of services provided by, and our relationships with, the thirdparty brokers (including insurance brokers and mortgage brokers), third-party MGAs and insurers
through which we distribute a portion of our insurance products. Our relationships with these trading
partners are significant factors relating to our success. If a carrier partner relationship terminates or there
is loss of strategic support or alignment, we may be unable to transition to a new relationship without
some short-term disruption, which could have a degree of financial impact. If carriers were to
experience liquidity problems or other financial (such as rating agency downgrades) or operational
difficulties, we could encounter business disruptions as a result, and our results of operations may suffer.

A failure to maintain our existing relationships with carriers, or a failure to build relationships with new
entrants to the market, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and
financial condition. Any of the aforementioned, or any other deterioration in our relationships with
third-party brokers or mortgage intermediaries could have a material adverse effect on our business,
results of operations and financial condition.

**_We depend on insurance companies and other third-party capacity and product providers providing_**
**_us with underwriting capacity and products, but we have no control over such insurance companies’_**

59


-----

**_or other third-party capacity and product providers’ abilities to provide insurance underwriting_**
**_capacity and products._**

As an insurance intermediary we depend on insurance companies providing us with insurance
underwriting capacity and products, which in turn depends upon, among other things, insurance
companies’ ability to procure reinsurance, over which we have no control. To the extent that reinsurance
becomes less widely available, for example as a result of adverse economic conditions, we may not be
able to provide the amounts or types of coverage desired by our customers. To retain underwriting
capacity for our MGA, we also need to maintain underwriting discipline and satisfactory loss ratios for
our insurance company partners. Capacity providers may also choose to withdraw capacity based upon
changes in our credit ratings or loss of reputation. Withdrawal by insurance companies of underwriting
capacity for whatever reason and in circumstances where replacement underwriting capacity cannot be
procured, or a significant increase in the rates charged by an insurance company, could have a material
adverse effect on our business performance and consequently upon our financial condition, results of
operations and cash flow.

**_The unaudited pro forma financial information presented herein is inherently subject to risks and_**
**_uncertainties._**

The unaudited Adjusted EBITDA Pro Forma for Completed Transactions, Adjusted EBITDA Pro
Forma for Q4 2023 Growth and Transactions and Total Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and the unaudited
Total Income Pro Forma for Completed Transaction, Total Income Pro Forma for Q4 Growth and
Transactions and Total Pro Forma Income presented in this offering memorandum is inherently subject
to risks and uncertainties. For the convenience of readers only, we include these metrics in this offering
memorandum to illustrate the effect of certain acquisitions and other transactions, actions or
assumptions, on our Adjusted EBITDA and Total Income as if these acquisitions and other transactions,
actions or assumptions had occurred on October 1, 2022. This information does not present our reported
results of operations for the twelve months ended September 30, 2023, and is not comparable to the
consolidated financial statements or other financial information included elsewhere in this offering
memorandum. Such unaudited pro forma financial information as of and for the twelve months ended
September 30, 2023 is based on unaudited financial information of AGHL, certain financial information
available to us in respect of companies that have been acquired or we have committed to acquire and
certain assumptions, expectations and estimates of management. This information has been prepared
by management for illustrative purposes and as supplemental information to facilitate management
discussion and analysis.

In addition, Adjusted EBITDA Pro Forma for Completed Transactions, Adjusted EBITDA Pro Forma
for Q4 2023 Growth and Transactions and Total Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and the unaudited Total
Income Pro Forma for Completed Transaction, Total Income Pro Forma for Q4 Growth and
Transactions and Total Pro Forma Income do not purport to indicate our future consolidated results of
operations. Our actual results may differ significantly from those reflected in these metrics. The
calculations of Adjusted EBITDA Pro Forma for Completed Transactions, Adjusted EBITDA Pro
Forma for Q4 2023 Growth and Transactions and Total Pro Forma Adjusted and the unaudited Total
Income Pro Forma for Completed Transaction, Total Income Pro Forma for Q4 Growth and
Transactions and Total Pro Forma Income are based on various assumptions and management estimates
and are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties. For example, Total Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA
and Adjusted EBITDA Pro Forma for Q4 2023 Growth and Transactions and Total Pro Forma Income
and Total Income Pro Forma for Q4 2023 Growth and Transactions include adjustments for transactions
that either have not closed or have not signed. As a result, we may never acquire or integrate these
targets in our business and may never receive the contribution from such acquisitions or transactions.
Total Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Total Pro Forma Income includes estimated future contribution
to our Adjusted EBITDA and Total Income which may not materialize within the expected time or at
all. As a result, these metrics have inherent limitations and may not give an accurate or complete picture
of the financial condition or results of operations of any entities prior to their acquisition by us, may not

60


-----

give an accurate or complete indication of our current or future results of operations or may not be
comparable to our consolidated financial statements or the other financial information included in this
offering memorandum and should not be relied upon when making an investment decision. See “—Our
_selective acquisition and disposal strategy exposes us to risks, including the risk that we may not be_
_able to successfully integrate acquired businesses or that acquisitions may have liabilities that we are_
_not aware of and may not be as profitable as we may have expected them to be and that disposals may_
_not have the impact on results of operations that we expected them to have.” These assumptions and_
management estimates may depend on a number of circumstances that are outside our control or may
not materialize in line with our expectations.

**_Potential future impairments of intangible assets could have a material adverse effect on our results_**
**_of operation._**

Our goodwill is a significant asset. As of September 30, 2023, the book value of our goodwill amounted
to £3,876.9 million while our total intangible assets amounted to £5,305.7 million. In accordance with
IFRS, we annually test whether goodwill and other assets with indefinite useful lives have suffered any
impairment. Other assets are also reviewed for impairments whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount. The
recoverable amount of an asset or a cash generating unit is determined based on the higher of fair value
less costs to sell and a value in use calculation based on management’s assumptions and estimates. Our
last impairment review on September 30, 2023 resulted in no impairment charge. A decrease in expected
cash flows of the group of cash generating units, changes in market conditions, loss of key customers
and a change in our imputed cost of capital may indicate potential impairment of recorded goodwill.
Weakness in the global economy also may cause us to make impairment charges, which, depending on
the amounts impaired, could have a material adverse effect on results of operations.

**_Competition in our industry is intense, and if we are unable to compete effectively, our business may_**
**_be adversely affected._**

We face intense competition in all areas of the insurance intermediary industry in which we operate,
based on product breadth, innovation, quality of service and price. Consolidation within the insurance
industry increases competition and can lead to downward pricing pressures as consolidated entities
compete for market share. In respect of our MGA and broking divisions, numerous other firms, as well
as insurance companies that directly solicit customers without the assistance of an agent or broker,
compete for a share of the various insurance markets and customers. Furthermore, aggressive pricing
by competitors in the underwriting industry could have a material adverse effect on our business and
results of operations. Any of the above, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse
effect on our business and financial position, our results of operation and our cash flow.

**_Adverse publicity, in particular relating to our financial condition, our cost-savings initiatives or_**
**_activities associated with the integration of acquired entities, may adversely affect our customer,_**
**_insurer and supplier relationships, may lead to increased regulatory scrutiny and may have a_**
**_negative impact upon the market perception of our business._**

Our success depends in significant part on our relationships with our capacity partners, industry
colleagues and customers. As an insurance intermediary, we depend on insurance companies providing
us with underwriting capacity and products. Adverse publicity relating to our financial condition,
including negative changes in our credit ratings, may have a material adverse effect on our relationships
with our capacity partners, industry colleagues and customers and/or the market perception of our
business. Insurance companies may, as a result of such adverse publicity, choose to withdraw
underwriting capacity and products in circumstances where no suitable replacement can be procured,
or may seek to impose an excessive increase in rates, and third-party brokers and mortgage
intermediaries may choose not to distribute our products. Existing suppliers may choose not to do
business with us, demand quicker payment terms or decline to extend normal trade credit and we may
find it difficult to obtain new or alternative suppliers. Customers may choose not to (and it may be more

61


-----

difficult to convince such customers to) subscribe, or continue to subscribe, to our products and services.
Adverse publicity may also result in increased regulatory scrutiny. Any of the foregoing could have a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_New expectations from investors, customers or employees on environmental, social and governance_**
**_matters could harm our business._**

Increasing scrutiny and changing expectations from investors, customers and our employees with
respect to environmental, social and governance practices may result in additional costs on us which
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_If we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or guidelines, we may not be able to conduct_**
**_business or may be subject to sanctions or substantial fines that may have a material adverse effect_**
**_on our reputation, results of operations and financial condition._**

Our UK-domiciled businesses are authorized and regulated by the FCA and firms in our industry must
maintain regulatory authorization. Our insurance intermediary activities must comply with FCA rules
which impose minimum “threshold conditions” that must be satisfied as well as robust standards for the
establishment and maintenance of proper systems and controls, notably for the conduct of business and
the fair treatment of customers and the protection of fiduciary funds (i.e. client monies). The FCA Rules
also impose upon us certain minimum capital and liquidity requirements. Our conduct obligations
require us to demonstrate that we are consistently delivering fair outcomes to consumers and that senior
management are taking responsibility for ensuring that we, and our staff at all levels, deliver the
consumer outcomes relevant to our business by establishing an appropriate culture. Situations can arise
in which our interests differ from those of customers or in which we represent two customers who are
both parties to the same insurance claim. The FCA Rules oblige us to proactively identify and manage
conflicts of interest fairly and we risk regulatory action if we do not do so. Additionally, future changes
in laws and regulations relating to our business, as well as any future regulatory intervention with
respect to our business or the industry more generally, could limit activities in the future and result in
increased costs of regulatory compliance and increased management attention being required to be
dedicated to compliance. This could consequently adversely affect our business, financial condition and
results of operations.

Firms have an ongoing obligation to periodically provide the FCA with certain information, including
on their financial performance and customer outcomes. The FCA supervises firms’ activities to assess
compliance with regulatory requirements, including client money rules. The FCA will seek additional
information from firms via surveys, thematic reviews and formal risk assessments. The FCA has
extensive investigative and disciplinary powers, including the power to impose fines and vary or cancel
regulatory permissions. While we maintain an ongoing dialogue with the FCA in the ordinary course
of business and while we consider our compliance with the FCA Rules to be robust, failure to comply
with the FCA Rules could lead to disciplinary action, including requiring customers to be compensated
for loss, the imposition of penalties and the revocation or variation of our authorizations to conduct
business, in whole or in part. In addition, individuals performing various controlled ‘Senior
Management’ functions in accordance with the Senior Managers & Certification Regime (“SMCR”)
for regulated firms are required to be approved by the FCA and to satisfy certain fitness and propriety
criteria. The SMCR requires a number of approved person to be in charge of a certain range of activities
within our business, including finance, audit and risk. Any disciplinary or enforcement action against
these individuals by the FCA could prevent such persons from continuing to work for us. As a number
of these individuals are key personnel, this could have a material adverse effect on our business.
Disciplinary or enforcement action against any individuals or against the business generally could result
in damage to our brands and reputation.

As such, any future material incidents of non-compliance within The Ardonagh Group and any business
that we are acquiring could result in enhanced sanctions, fines, penalties or other disciplinary actions,

62


-----

including, among other things, limitations or prohibitions on our future business activities, which could
consequently materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Although we conduct due diligence with respect to the business and operations of acquired businesses,
we may fail to identify all material facts concerning these businesses. Unanticipated events or liabilities
relating to acquired businesses could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations,
financial condition and cash flow.

Conducting our business in an ethically acceptable manner is important to our reputation, status with
regulators and business prospects. Although we have adopted and maintain a “Code of Ethics” that
includes provisions addressing compliance with best practices, we have recently been subject to
fraudulent behavior by employees in connection with the embezzlement of both our and certain
customer funds. Any such instances (including our failure to adequately implement monitoring
systems) may expose us to liabilities, as well as to reputational damage as a result of such occurrences.

**_Regulation or other requirements in the areas of privacy, information security and data protection_**
**_could increase our costs and affect or limit how we collect and/or use personal data and our business_**
**_opportunities._**

There is increasing awareness and concern among the general public, governmental bodies, and others
regarding marketing and privacy matters, particularly as they relate to individual privacy interests.
Recent events, including the discovery of monitoring activities by certain governmental agencies, have
resulted in a heightened legislative and regulatory focus on privacy, data protection and information
security around the world and, in particular, across Europe. Legislators and regulators in the EEA have
adopted and are introducing further privacy, data protection and information security laws, regulation
and guidance that could potentially have a significant and adverse impact on our current and planned
privacy, data protection and information security-related practices, our collection, use, sharing,
retention and safeguarding of consumer and/or employee personal data and some of our current or
planned business activities. In particular, and in addition to incurring compliance costs, changes to such
laws, regulations and guidance may create significant business interruption risks if we are no longer
able to use customer data in the manner in which we have been accustomed.

Our ability to obtain, retain, process and otherwise manage the personal data of our customers is
governed by data protection laws and regulations, including the GDPR, which came into effect on May
25, 2018 (including as implemented into the laws of the UK) and the Data Protection Act 2018, as well
as the regulatory rules and guidance issued by, among others, the UK Information Commissioner’s
Office These data protection laws provide individuals with a number of rights (data subjects), impose
strict controls over the processing of personal data by both controllers and processors of personal data
and impose strict sanctions with substantial administrative fines and potential claims for damages from
data subjects for breach of their rights. Should a serious data breach occur, the GDPR sets out potentially
onerous obligations to notify regulators and data subjects whose personal data has been compromised
and may result in the imposition of significant sanctions and penalties, which will require heightened
escalation and notification processes with associated response plans. If a significant or widely
publicized incident, such as an unlawful disclosure of employee or customer data were to occur, whether
as a result of a cyber-attack, the failure of our IT security systems, employee negligence or the actions
of our vendors, we may be subject to legal claims by individuals (including in the form of group
litigation) and counterparties, fines and/or other enforcement action which could result in adverse
regulatory and financial consequences and could harm our reputation.

Our EEA, UK and Swiss businesses may also be subject to evolving data protection laws on personal
data export as they may transfer personal data from the EEA, UK and Switzerland to other jurisdictions.
For example, in 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union (“CJEU”) invalidated the EU-US
Privacy Shield framework regarding the transfer of personal data from the European Union to the United
States in its landmark decision Schrems II. While the EU-US Privacy Shield was subsequently replaced
in July 2023 by the EU-US Data Privacy Framework, the CJEU placed additional conditions on the use

63


-----

of the main alternative mechanism for adequate data export, i.e., the standard contractual clauses, which
requires the exporting entity to assess the laws of the importing entity and determine whether additional
safeguards need to be applied to protect the personal data. Data export continues to be a contentious
issue and there may be future challenges and requirements. We rely on a mixture of mechanisms to
transfer data from our EEA, UK and Swiss business to India as part of our Mphasis outsourcing contract
and could be impacted by changes in law, regulation or guidance as a result of the current climate.

Current European laws that cover online marketing by email or other electronic communications such
as SMS or cookies are under reform and may change in due course. A draft new law, i.e., the ePrivacy
Regulation, was announced on January 10, 2017 and has been discussed at length within the EU
Council, although discussions have currently stalled and it is unclear whether or when it will eventually
come into force. Unlike the current marketing rules across the European Union, this ePrivacy
Regulation will directly be implemented into the laws of each of the European Union Member States
without the need for further enactment (although certain local deviations are contemplated in some
areas). The current draft extends the strict opt-in marketing rules to business-to-business
communications, strengthens requirements around other online marketing tools, and significantly
increases penalties to the same level of fines as the GDPR. The UK is unlikely to implement equivalent
regulation, but the UK’s Data Protection and Digital Information Bill (No.2), which is still being
debated in the House of Lords, looks likely to make changes to the current UK ePrivacy regime. These
changes may make the requirements around cookies in the UK less onerous. Further regulatory
developments in the EEA, UK and Switzerland may impact our current online marketing strategies and
revising these strategies may result in additional compliance costs. Furthermore, industry developments
driven by privacy considerations may also impact our current online marketing strategies, including
changes to ability to use third-party cookies.

We are also subject to the terms of our privacy policies and privacy-related obligations to third parties.
We strive to comply with all applicable laws, policies and legal obligations, decisions and opinions of
relevant local authorities relating to privacy and data protection in the jurisdictions in which we operate
as well as our other privacy-related obligations. These laws and regulations are subject to revision and
differing interpretations and have generally become more stringent over time. We cannot predict the
nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which we might be subject or the manner in
which existing laws might be administered or interpreted. It also is possible that these obligations may
not be applied consistently by regulatory authorities or across courts. These privacy and data protectionrelated laws, regulations and guidance are evolving with new or modified laws and regulations proposed
and implemented frequently and existing laws, regulations and guidance subject to new or different
interpretations. Compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly and disruptive to the operation
of our business. Although we believe we have implemented appropriate controls to meet these
regulatory obligations, we cannot assure you that our controls will always be foolproof. Our past
compliance history may be factored into any matters that come to a regulator’s attention in the future,
including any apparent violations. If our systems and controls are found to be insufficient, we may be
exposed to heightened sanctions, financial crime and/or fraud risk and the relevant business, its directors
and certain members of staff could face criminal sanctions, regulatory censure or financial penalties.

Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with such obligations or with our own privacy policies,
or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized processing, release or transfer of
information, may result in governmental enforcement actions, litigation or public statements against us
by consumer advocacy groups or others and could cause our customers and the third parties with whom
we work to lose trust in us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Additionally, if
the third parties with whom we work violate either applicable laws or our own policies, such violations
may put the information in our database at risk and could in turn have a material adverse effect on our
business. Furthermore, compliance with current and/or new laws and regulations could result in the
incurrence of additional compliance costs and, under certain circumstances, could require changes in
the way we conduct our business, which, in each case, may adversely impact our business and results
of operations.

**_We are subject to regulatory, business and economic risks associated with operating abroad and_**
**_trading internationally._**

For the twelve months ended September 30, 2023, we generated 22.8% of our Total Income in our
International Advisory segment, and have global customers and plan to continue the international
expansion of our business operations and trading activity. As such, we are subject to a variety of risks
inherent in serving a global customer base and in maintaining offices abroad, including, among others:

- political, social, or economic instability;

- risks related to the legal and regulatory environment in foreign jurisdictions, including with
respect to insurance intermediation, and unexpected changes in laws, regulatory requirements,
and enforcement;

- risks that our IT systems or internal controls and procedures may not be adequate to support
operations abroad;

- potential damage to our brand and reputation due to compliance with local laws, including
potential censorship or requirements to provide user information to local authorities;

- fluctuations in currency exchange rates and inflation;

- higher levels of credit risk or payment fraud;

- longer payment cycles;

- reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;

- imposition of investment requirements or other restrictions by foreign governments;

- risks associated with measures implemented to manage health crisis caused by communicable
diseases, including the COVID-19 pandemic;

- compliance with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the UK Bribery Act 2010,
and similar laws in other jurisdictions;

- our ability to execute effective and efficient cross-border sourcing of services on behalf of our
clients; and

- compliance with statutory equity requirements and management of tax consequences.

As an insurance broker, we are regulated by local regulated authorities in the jurisdictions in which we
operate, and subject to compliance risk in connection with our operations abroad. We are also subject
to laws regarding money laundering, financing of terrorism and laws prohibiting us, our employees or
intermediaries from making improper payments or offers of payment to foreign governments and their
officials and political parties for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, including the UK’s
Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 and Bribery Act 2010 (including The Fourth European Union Anti-Money
Laundering Directive implemented in the United Kingdom by the Money Laundering, Terrorist
Financing and Transfer of Funds (Information on the Payer) Regulations 2017, which impose additional
requirements with respect to determining beneficial ownership and identifying politically exposed
persons). From January 10, 2020, we have also been subject to the Fifth European Union Anti Money
Laundering Directive, which was transposed by the United Kingdom via the Money Laundering and
Terrorist Financing (Amendment) Regulations 2019. The Fifth European Union Anti Money
Laundering Directive makes a number of key amendments to the Fourth European Union Anti Money
Laundering Directive, among them: (i) requiring firms to apply customer due diligence measures to
existing customers where they have any legal duty in a year to contact the customer for the purposes of

65


-----

reviewing any information which relates to the beneficial ownership of the customer, or when an
existing customer must be contacted in order to fulfil any duty under the International Tax Compliance
Regulations 2015; and (ii) requiring firms, when entering into a new business relationship with a
company or trust that is subject to the beneficial ownership registration requirements under the Fourth
European Union Anti Money Laundering Directive, to collect either proof of registration on the register
or an extract of the register. We also may be subject to sanctions administered by the United States
Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”), the United Nations Security
Council, the European Union, the UK Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation, the UK National
Crime Agency, or other relevant sanctions authorities.

As a result of our international reach, we may provide insurance intermediaries services to clients in a
jurisdiction subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny. Failure to comply with any local laws could result
in investigations, public censure, financial penalties, liability and/or enforcement actions being brought
against us. Damage to our reputation, whether because of a failure to comply with applicable laws or
any regulatory action, could deter customers from choosing us. Any of these developments could impair
our ability to conduct our business and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations or financial condition or could have a negative impact our reputation. We cannot predict the
manner in which existing laws or regulations might be administered or interpreted or the nature, scope
or effect of future regulatory requirements to which we might be subject.

We may be subject to fluctuations in the exchange rate between the currencies used in the international
markets in which we operate, including as a result of our Specialty Broking and our International
Advisory platforms placing insurance for global risks, and our accounting currency, the pound sterling.
Our Specialty Broking and International Advisory segments place insurance for a significant amount of
mining, natural resources and energy risks and significant price fluctuations in these commodities,
whether due to supply conditions, geopolitical or economic variables, weather or other unpredictable
external factors may have a negative effect on our clients’ economic position.

**_Breach of international trade sanction laws, and other laws such as anticorruption regulations, could_**
**_result in fines, criminal penalties and other adverse effects on our business_**

We are based in the United Kingdom but place policies globally. International economic and trade
sanctions are complex and subject to frequent change, including in relation to jurisdictional reach and
to the list of countries, entities, products and individuals subject to sanctions. Countries or defined
regional territories may also become the subject of sanctions, for example the Crimea region of Ukraine,
resulting in stringent requirements for trade with such countries or territories. In providing our services,
we must comply with applicable sanctions, including laws, rules and regulations relating to the conduct
of business, trade sanction laws administered by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control, the E.U.,
the U.K. and the United Nations (“U.N.”), and the requirements of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices
Act as well as other anti-bribery and corruption rules and requirements. In the past year, there has been
an increase in U.S. designations in relation to Russia and China (including recent sanctions imposed on
Russia by the United States as well as the E.U. and U.K. due to Ukraine), and there has also been an
increased risk of counter-sanctions in some locations, such as China and Russia in response to the
recently imposed sanctions. We have also seen a maturing of the U.K. sanctions regime, which has
navigated a differing path from the E.U. and U.S. sanctions regimes but largely with the same
objectives. A number of volatile geopolitical events are likely to affect the implementation of sanctions
such as the change of regime in Afghanistan, the escalation of sanctions towards Belarus, Russia’s
invasion of Ukraine, the uncertainty around the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, negotiations between the E.U.,
United States and Iran over a new nuclear deal as well as the continuing trade war between the United
States and China with their sanctions and subsequent counter-sanctions. Such events could impact our
ability to expand our business in the future. As a result, we cannot predict the impacts of any changes
in the United States, E.U., U.K. or other sanctions, and whether such changes could have a material
adverse impact on our business, financial condition and result of operations.

66


-----

Ensuring compliance with such controls and regulations may be difficult or costly and there is a risk
that we could become subject to investigations or claims by authorities. The complexity of maintaining
oversight over the operations of certain third party contractors may expose us to risks of inadvertent,
indirect or secondary violations of applicable sanctions laws. Sanctions laws are regularly evolving and
while we have policies and procedures in place to ensure we only place policies in compliance with
applicable sanctions laws, a policy may subsequently become impermissible, and we may have to react
quickly to ensure our ongoing compliance. If we fail to comply with sanctions, we and our employees
could be subject to civil or criminal penalties, including monetary penalties, and, in extreme cases,
imprisonment of responsible employees for violations of these laws. We may also be adversely affected
through penalties, reputational harm, loss of access to certain markets, or otherwise. Changes in
sanctions and other trade restrictions may delay the introduction and sale of our services in certain
markets and prevent our customers with international operations from using our services. Any change
in trade regulations, sanctions or related laws, shift in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations,
or change in the countries, governments, persons or technologies targeted by such regulations, could
result in decreased use of our services, or in our decreased ability to export or sell our services to existing
or potential customers with international operations. Any violation of sanctions or decrease in the use
of our services or limitation on our ability to export or sell our services would likely adversely affect
our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Legislative or taxation changes or HMRC enforcement actions may have a material adverse impact_**
**_on our business, results of operations and financial condition._**

We are subject to the laws of England and Wales and the taxation rules administered by HM Revenue
& Customs (“HMRC”) and we are required to certify to HMRC that we have appropriate tax accounting
arrangements in place. Changes in legislation or regulations and actions by regulators, including
changes in administration and enforcement policies, could from time to time require operational
improvements or modifications, the conduct of reviews and audits or the cessation of certain business
practices, product lines or income streams that could result in higher costs or restrict our ability to
operate our business and, as a result, have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations
and financial condition. HMRC may also take enforcement actions against us which may result in fines,
penalties and/or interest charges being imposed on us which may have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, we are currently in process of
assessing the impact of Pillar Two, which introduces a global minimum effective tax rate for certain
multinational groups with consolidated revenues over a certain amount and becomes effective this year.
If we conclude that Pillar Two has a significant impact, it could have a negative impact on our financial
position and cash flow.

Our business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected by the
outcome of certain actual and potential claims, lawsuits and other proceedings.

We are subject to various actual and potential claims, lawsuits and proceedings relating principally to
alleged errors, omissions or unfair provisions in connection with the placement of insurance or the
provision of financial services advice in the ordinary course of business. As we often assist our
customers with matters involving substantial amounts of money, including the provision of financial
services advice and the placement of insurance coverage and handling of related claims, errors and
omissions claims against us may arise that allege potential liability for all or part of the amounts in
question. Claimants can seek large damage awards and these claims can involve potentially significant
defense costs. Such claims, lawsuits and other proceedings could, for example, allege damages as a
result of our employees, agents or sub-agents improperly:

- failing to place coverage on behalf of customers;

- failing to inform clients of relevant warranties and exclusions applying to their policies;

67


-----

- failing to adequately advise customers of their duties of disclosure and the risk of
underinsurance; and

- failing to provide insurance companies with complete and accurate information relating to the
risks being insured or to appropriately apply funds that we hold for our customers on a fiduciary
basis.

Our MGA segment assesses risk and issues policies to customers on behalf of insurance companies. In
writing an insurance policy, we agree to a set of underwriting criteria with an insurance company and
write the policy under delegated authority from the insurance company. If we underwrite a greater risk
than agreed by the insurance company, handle a claim in excess of any cap without referring such claim
to the insurance company, issue policies that are outside of the applicable eligible business criteria, use
staff who are not authorized under the relevant delegated authority agreement or otherwise act beyond
the scope of our delegated authority, the insurance company may refuse to provide the funds in respect
of the insurance claim in question. As a result, we would incur the liability for such claims, which could
have a negative effect on our reputation, financial position and cash flow.

We maintain professional indemnity insurance for errors and omissions claims, the terms of which vary
by policy year. Our ability to obtain such professional indemnity insurance in the future in the amounts
and with the deductibles we desire may be adversely impacted by general developments in the market
for such insurance or by our own claims experience. We cannot guarantee that in the future we will be
able to renew our current insurance policies on favorable terms, if at all. In recent years, our self-insured
risks in our Advisory platform and MGAs have increased. In respect of such risks, we have established
a provision for claims in respect of outstanding errors and omissions claims that we believe to be
adequate in light of current information and legal advice; we adjust this provision from time to time
according to relevant developments. If such insurance coverage proves inadequate or unavailable or if
there is an increase in liabilities for which we self-insure, our business, results of operations and
financial condition may be materially adversely affected.

We may also incur liabilities for the actions of our directors, employees, agents and representatives
related to our business, including in relation to financial crime and fraudulent activities, which may
expose us to liability for claims and proceedings that could have a negative effect on our reputation,
financial position and cash flow. In addition, our reputation and operations may be adversely affected
by contractual or other proceedings instituted by third-party service providers, suppliers or competitors.
Our reputation and operations may also be adversely affected by failures in claims management.
Instances of failing to notify insurers of claims on behalf of customers, of inaccurate or incomplete cash
reserves, poor service quality or excessive claims handling costs may result in claims, lawsuits or other
proceedings as well as damage to our reputation.

Our brands and reputation may be negatively affected if customers seek redress publicly, through the
courts or otherwise. We may suffer such brand and reputational damage even in circumstances where
allegations by customers and/or consumer groups are not ultimately upheld. Any of these could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Our success depends on our continued access to various proprietary technologies and the continued_**
**_protection of our trademarks and other proprietary intellectual property rights._**

We rely upon intellectual property that is owned or licensed by us to use various technologies, conduct
our operations and sell our products and services. Legal challenges could be made against our use of
our proprietary or our licensed intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, patents and trade secrets)
and we may be required to enter into licensing arrangements on unfavorable terms, incur monetary
damages or be enjoined from use of the intellectual property rights in question. Our trademarks and
other intellectual property rights are important to our success and competitive position and the loss of
or inability to enforce trademark and other proprietary intellectual property rights could harm our
business. We devote substantial resources to the establishment and protection of our trademark and

68


-----

other proprietary intellectual property rights. Our efforts to establish and protect our trademarks and
other proprietary intellectual property rights may not be adequate to prevent imitation of our brands or
products by others or to prevent others from seeking to block sales of our branded products.
Additionally, we could face heightened risk relating to integration of acquired consumer-focused
brands. Any unforeseen issues or negative publicity relating intellectual property protection from these
brands could cause harm to our business.

**_Our success is dependent on the consistent application of our risk and compliance frameworks across_**
**_all of our segments._**

Despite the frameworks we have put into place, as with any large organization, we face a risk that our
risk and compliance policies and procedures may not be fully effective in identifying, monitoring and
managing the risks that we face. If our policies and procedures are not successful in capturing all of the
risks to which we are or may be exposed, we may suffer harm to our reputation or be subject to litigation
or regulatory actions that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
results of operations.

Reporting guidelines, including those for risk reporting, internal control and financial reporting, may
also not always be followed properly and in a timely manner. The failure by any of our employees or
operational segments to follow risk and compliance standards could have a material adverse effect on
our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, some of our risk evaluation
methods depend on information provided by third parties and on public information regarding markets,
customers or other matters that are otherwise not generated by us. In some cases, that information may
not be accurate, complete or up-to-date. Such failure could consequently materially and adversely affect
our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Although each of our businesses maintains and will continue to maintain compliance, supported as
necessary by Group legal and compliance departments, it is important to ensure that our Group
management standards, including risk control and compliance policies, will always be fully and
consistently applied throughout our organization, in particular since in the past some of our businesses
have failed to meet internal guidelines and external FCA regulations. We may, however, experience
difficulties in harmonizing our management, legal and compliance processes and in ensuring the full
and consistent application of policies across our large and diversified organization.

**_The audit reports of Deloitte LLP included in this offering memorandum include statements to limit_**
**_liability and the persons that may rely on such reports and the opinions contained therein._**

The audit reports of Deloitte LLP for the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 are
included in this offering memorandum. Deloitte LLP has undertaken its audit work to state to members
of The Ardonagh Group those matters that they are required to state to them in an independent auditor’s
report and for no other purpose. Investors in the Notes should understand that these statements are
intended to disclaim any liability to parties other than the members of The Ardonagh Group with respect
to those reports.

The SEC would not permit such limiting language to be included in a registration statement or a
prospectus used in connection with an offering of securities registered under the Securities Act or in a
report filed under the Exchange Act. If a court were to give effect to such limiting language, the recourse
that investors in the Notes may have against the independent auditor or reporting accountant based on
its reports or the consolidated financial information to which they relate could be limited.

**_If we are required to make unexpected payments to any pension plans applicable to our employees,_**
**_or to cover plan funding shortfalls, our financial condition may be adversely affected._**

If we are required to make unexpected payments to any pension plans applicable to our employees, or
to cover plan funding shortfalls, our financial condition may be adversely affected. We operate several

69


-----

defined contribution pension schemes as well as three closed defined benefit schemes for certain former
employees. Cash flows may be negatively impacted to the extent we are required to make any additional
payments to any relevant defined benefit pension plans in excess of the amounts assumed in our current
projections and assumptions or report higher pension plan expenses under relevant accounting rules.
Moreover, in certain jurisdictions, pension regulators and authorities may be granted extensive powers
that may be exercised in connection with the completion of certain transactions. For further information
on the net pension surplus position of the schemes entered into by the Group see note 20 to the
Unaudited Interim Financial Statements.

Any future changes to, or strengthening of, pension legislation or regulations (particularly the regulatory
funding regime), could increase requirements for cash funding, demanding more financial resources to
meet governmentally mandated pension requirements. Future contributions to our defined benefit
pension plans could therefore reduce the cash otherwise available to operate our business and could
have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

**Risks Related to our Financial Profile**

**_We are exposed to liquidity risk. Ongoing liquidity challenges may have an adverse impact on_**
**_business value and earning capacity._**

Our ability to obtain liquidity is essential to our capacity to meet both anticipated and unanticipated
financial obligations in a manner that does not prejudice our day-to-day operations. Liquidity risk refers
to any inability on our part to meet payment obligations. It arises where, for internal reasons (such as a
specific major issue) or external reasons (such as macroeconomic conditions), we face a sudden
reduction in available liquidity, or a sudden need to increase funding. For example, future exceptional
payments or a negative result in a material dispute could result in our experiencing shortfalls of cash.
Moreover, the incurrence of additional debt could lead to a downgrade by rating agencies which could
in turn result in revenue or cash pressure through competitors using the information to discredit the
business among customers and staff, insurers increasing pressure on payment and collections processes
as a means of managing their risk and staff becoming unsettled as a result of adverse publicity. If market
conditions were adverse for an extended period, if there were a general economic downturn, if our credit
standing were to decline or if we were unable to access the market to meet our liquidity requirements,
such factors individually or in the aggregate could have a material adverse effect upon our cash flow,
business, results of operations, and financial condition. See “—Risks Related to Our Business and
_Industry—Our business may be adversely affected by a decline in economic conditions in the United_
_Kingdom.”_

**_We will require a significant amount of cash to service our debt and sustain our operations. Our_**
**_ability to generate or raise sufficient cash depends on many factors beyond our control._**

Our ability to make principal or interest payments when due on our indebtedness, including our
obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement and the Notes, and to fund our
ongoing operations, will depend on our future performance and ability to generate cash, which is subject
to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, legal, regulatory and other factors, as well as
other factors discussed in these “Risk Factors,” many of which are beyond our control.

The Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement provides for the New Term Facilities and the CAR
Facility, each of which matures in 2031, and the Revolving Credit Facility, which matures on January
14, 2029. See “Description of Other Indebtedness and Financing Arrangements—Senior Secured
_Credit Facilities Agreement.” The Senior Secured Notes mature in 2031 and the Senior Notes mature_
in 2032. At the respective maturity dates of the Secured Credit Facilities, the Notes, or any other debt
which we may incur, if we do not have sufficient cash flows from operations and other capital resources
to pay our debt obligations, or to fund our other liquidity needs, we may be required to refinance or
restructure our indebtedness. If we are unable to refinance or restructure all or a portion of our
indebtedness or obtain such refinancing or restructuring on terms acceptable to us, we may be forced to

70


-----

sell assets, or raise additional debt or equity financing in amounts that could be substantial or the holders
of our debt may accelerate our debt and, to the extent such debt is secured, foreclose on our assets. The
type, timing and terms of any future financing, restructuring, asset sales or other capital raising
transactions will depend on our cash needs and the prevailing conditions in the financial markets. We
cannot assure you that we will be able to accomplish any of these measures in a timely manner or on
commercially reasonable terms, if at all. In such an event, we may not have sufficient cash or sources
of cash to repay all of our debt. In addition, the terms of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement,
the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or the agreements governing other future indebtedness, as
applicable, may limit our ability to pursue any of these measures.

**_Our derivative instruments may be ineffective or may not be implemented correctly._**

We are subject to the risk of changes in exchange rates and their impact on our derivative instruments.
Hedging arrangements entered into at historic rates may become unfavorable in future. There is a risk
that bank credit lines are exceeded which may cause us to be barred from taking out new derivatives.
We also face counterparty risk where the hedging bank might fail to honor the hedging transactions. An
inability to enter into hedging arrangements on favorable terms may result in us not receiving sufficient
U.S. dollars, euros or Australian dollars to meet contractual obligations as they fall due, including under
the Notes. Any of these events could cause losses and have a material adverse effect on our business,
results of operations or financial conditions.

**_The New Senior Secured Credit Facilities will bear interest at floating rates that could rise_**
**_significantly, increasing our interest cost and reducing cash flow._**

Our borrowings under the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities which represent a large portion of our
indebtedness will bear interest at per annum rates equal to SOFR, CDOR, Daily Compounded SONIA
or EURIBOR, in each case adjusted periodically, plus a margin. These interest rates could rise
significantly in the future, thereby increasing our interest expenses associated with these obligations,
reducing cash flow available for capital expenditures and hindering our ability to make payments on
the Notes.

The material increases in global inflation since early 2022, reaching double-digit levels not seen since
the 1980s, and the risk that annual inflation may remain high for a long period of time (driven at least
in part by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the resulting impact on energy markets) has forced central
banks of the major world economies, including the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central
Bank, to significantly increase certain interest rates in a very short timeframe, ending the lengthy period
of low interest rates. This has resulted in increases in base rates such as SOFR, CDOR, Daily
Compounded SONIA or EURIBOR, on which our floating rate instruments are calculated, including
the Existing Senior Secured Credit Facilities, which has significantly and adversely affected our
financing costs. The interest rates under our floating rate financing arrangements could continue to rise
significantly in the future, increasing our interest expense associated with these obligations, reducing
cash flow available for capital expenditures, and hindering our ability to make cash payments on the
Notes.

Although we may enter into and maintain certain hedging arrangements designed to fix a portion of
these rates, there can be no assurance that hedging will continue to be available on commercially
reasonable terms. Hedging itself carries certain risks, including that we may need to pay a significant
amount, including costs, to unwind any hedging arrangements.

If we determine that a benchmark rate has been permanently discontinued at the request of the majority
lender, the agent will use an alternative reference rate in the manner as described therein.

**_Our substantial leverage and debt service obligations could adversely affect our business and prevent_**
**_us from fulfilling our obligations with respect to the Notes, Note Guarantees and the Collateral._**

We cannot guarantee that we will be able to generate enough cash flow from operations to service our
debt obligations. We are highly leveraged and expect to continue to be highly leveraged following the
Offering. As of September 30, 2023, as adjusted to give effect to the Transactions, we would have total
financial indebtedness of £3,749 million (equivalent). See “Capitalization.”

The degree to which we are and continue to be leveraged following the issuance of the Notes could
have important consequences to holders of the Notes, including, but not limited to:

- making it difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness;

- making us vulnerable to, and reducing our flexibility to respond to, general adverse economic
and industry conditions;

- requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment
of principal of, and interest on, indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of such cash
flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, joint ventures, or other general
corporate purposes;

- limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the
competitive environment and the industry in which we operate;

- placing us at a competitive disadvantage as compared to our competitors, to the extent that they
are not as highly leveraged; and

- limiting our ability to borrow additional funds and increasing the cost of any such borrowing.

Any of these or other consequences or events could have a material adverse effect on our ability to
satisfy our debt obligations, including the Notes.

Despite our substantial leverage, we may still be able to incur more debt under the Indenture governing
the Notes, which could further exacerbate the risk described above.

The terms of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement and the terms of the Indenture will permit
us to incur substantial additional indebtedness, including in respect of committed borrowings under the
Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement or borrowings under any credit facility that replaces or
refinances the New Senior Secured Facilities. See “Description of Other Indebtedness and Financing
_Arrangements—The Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement.”_

Under the Indenture, we will be permitted to incur additional indebtedness, in addition to specified
permitted indebtedness, so long as we meet the relevant ratio test on a pro forma basis as described
under “Description of the Notes—Limitation on Indebtedness.” The Indenture will allow us to incur
secured debt (including debt that is secured on assets that do not secure the Notes) and will allow our
non-Guarantor subsidiaries to incur additional debt that would be structurally senior to the Notes.
Moreover, the Indenture will not prevent us from incurring liabilities that do not constitute Indebtedness
pursuant to the definition in the Indenture. If we are able to designate some of our Restricted
Subsidiaries as Unrestricted Subsidiaries (each as defined under “Description of the Notes—Certain
_Definitions”), those Unrestricted Subsidiaries would be permitted to borrow beyond the limitations_
specified in the Indenture and engage in other activities in which Restricted Subsidiaries may not
engage.

**_We are subject to restrictive covenants that may limit our ability to finance future operations and_**
**_capital needs and to pursue business opportunities and activities._**

The Indenture will restrict, among other things, our ability to:

- incur or guarantee additional indebtedness and issue certain preferred stock;

- make certain restricted payments, including dividends or other distributions, and make certain
investments;

- create or permit to exist certain liens;

- sell certain assets;

- create certain restrictions on the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends or make
other payments to us;

- merge or consolidate with other entities or transfer all or substantially all of our assets and the
assets of our subsidiaries on a consolidated basis;

- guarantee certain types of additional debt of the Issuer or a Guarantor without also guaranteeing
the Notes;

- engage in certain transactions with affiliates;

- impair the security interests in the Collateral; and

- create unrestricted subsidiaries.

All of these limitations are subject to significant exceptions and qualifications. See “Description of the
_Notes.” Despite these exceptions and qualifications, the covenants to which we are subject could limit_
our ability to finance our future operations and capital needs and our ability to pursue business
opportunities and activities that may be in our interest.

In addition, we are subject to the affirmative and negative covenants contained in the Senior Secured
Credit Facilities Agreement while amounts under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement
remain outstanding. Furthermore, under certain circumstances, the Revolving Credit Facility will
require us to comply with certain specified financial ratios while amounts are outstanding under
thereunder. See “Description of Other Indebtedness and Financing Arrangements—Senior Secured
_Credit Facilities Agreement.” Our ability to meet the financial ratios under the Senior Secured Credit_
Facilities Agreement may be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that we
will meet such financial ratios. A breach of any of those covenants, including our failure to comply with
the financial ratios under the Revolving Credit Facility, or the occurrence of certain specified events
will, subject to applicable cure periods and other limitations, result in an event of default under the
Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement. In particular, upon the occurrence of any event of default
under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement, the Majority Lenders (being, subject to certain
limitations, lenders of the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities whose commitments thereunder
aggregate at least 66⅔% of the total commitments thereunder) could (among other remedies) cancel the
availability of the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities and elect to declare all amounts outstanding
under the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities, together with accrued interest, immediately due and
payable. In addition, upon the occurrence of any event of default for failure to comply with any financial
covenant granted for the benefit of the lenders under any but not all of the New Senior Secured Credit
Facilities, the Majority Lenders under those Secured Credit Facilities benefitting from such financial
covenant only (being, subject to certain limitations, lenders of the applicable New Senior Secured Credit
Facilities whose commitments thereunder aggregate at least 66⅔% of the total commitments
thereunder) could (among other remedies) cancel the availability of the New Senior Secured Credit

73


-----

Facilities benefitting from such financial covenant only and elect to declare all amounts outstanding
under the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities benefitting from such financial covenant only, together
with accrued interest, immediately due and payable. A default or event of default under the Senior
Secured Credit Facilities Agreement could lead to an event of default and acceleration under other debt
instruments that contain cross-default or cross-acceleration provisions, including the cross-acceleration
provision that will be in the Indenture. If our creditors, including the lenders under the Senior Secured
Credit Facilities Agreement, accelerate the payment of amounts owing to them under such other debt
instruments, we cannot assure you that our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries would be sufficient
to repay in full those amounts, to satisfy all other liabilities of our subsidiaries which would be due and
payable and to make payments to enable us to repay the Notes, in full or in part. In addition, if we are
unable to repay those amounts, our creditors could proceed against any collateral (including the Shared
Collateral) granted to them to secure repayment of those amounts.

**_The Issuer and the Company are dependent upon cash flow from subsidiaries to meet the obligations_**
**_on the Notes._**

The Issuer is a newly incorporated finance company that conducts no business operations of its own
and has no significant assets other than, following the completion of the Transactions, the Proceeds
Loan made to the Company, which is a holding company. Payment of interest and repayment of our
indebtedness, including under the Notes, will be wholly dependent on the ability of the Company to
make such cash available to the Issuer, through interest payments under the Proceeds Loan or other
payments. We intend to provide funds to the Company in order to meet the obligations on the Notes
through a combination of dividends and interest payments on intercompany loans. If our subsidiaries
do not fulfil their obligations under the intercompany loans and do not distribute cash to the Company
in sufficient time to allow the Issuer to make scheduled payments on the Notes, the Issuer will not have
any other source of funds that would allow it to make such payments. Cash and cash equivalents held
by our regulated entities can only be extracted and upstreamed to their direct or indirect parent entities,
including for purposes of debt service or, in the case of such entities that are Guarantors, in the event of
an enforcement on such entity’s Note Guarantee, to the extent that such regulated entities has sufficient
cumulative distributable reserves and that the minimum capital requirements continue to be met. See
“Description of the Notes—The Note Guarantees—General.”

Agreements governing our debt (including the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement) may also
restrict and, in some cases may prohibit, the ability of these subsidiaries to move cash within their
restricted group. In particular, the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement restricts the ability of the
Issuer’s subsidiaries from paying cash interest on the Senior Notes while an event of default thereunder
is continuing. Applicable tax laws may also subject such payments to further taxation and applicable
corporate law may limit the amounts that some of our subsidiaries will be permitted to pay as dividends
or distributions on their equity interests, or even prevent such payments. In particular, our ability to pay
dividends to the Issuer will generally be limited to the amount of distributable reserves available to us.
Distributions by certain of our subsidiaries will also be subject to pro rata distributions to minority
interests. See “Summary—Summary Corporate and Financing Structure.” In addition, minority
shareholders have interests in certain of our subsidiaries and may receive certain distributions ahead of
distributions made to holders of the Notes. From time to time, we have bought out and we may continue
to buy out minority interests as and when market opportunities are aligned with our business strategy.

The inability to transfer cash among entities within their respective consolidated groups may mean that,
even though the entities, in aggregate, may have sufficient resources to meet their obligations, they may
not be permitted to make the necessary transfers from one entity in their restricted group to another
entity in their restricted group in order to make payments to the entity owing the obligations. The
subsidiaries of the Company that do not guarantee the Notes have no obligation to make payments with
respect to any of the Notes. In the event that we do not receive distributions or other payments from our
subsidiaries, we may be unable to make required principal payments on the Notes and we may be unable
to make interest payments in cash.

**Risks Related to the Notes, the Note Guarantees and the Collateral**

**_Your right to receive payment under the Senior Note Guarantees is contractually subordinated to_**
**_senior debt of the Subsidiary Guarantors._**

The obligations of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors under
their respective Senior Note Guarantee will be contractually subordinated in right of payment to the
prior payment in full in cash of all existing and future obligations in respect of senior debt of such
Subsidiary Guarantor. This senior debt includes the guarantees of and/or obligations under the Senior
Secured Notes and the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities. Although the Senior Indenture will contain
restrictions on the ability of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Company and the Subsidiary
Guarantors to incur additional debt, any additional debt incurred may be substantial and senior to the
Senior Note Guarantees.

Upon any payment or distribution to creditors of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Company or a
Subsidiary Guarantor in respect of an insolvency event, the holders of senior debt of the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer, the Company or such Subsidiary Guarantor will be entitled to be paid in full from the
assets of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Company or such Subsidiary Guarantor before any
payment may be made pursuant to such Senior Note Guarantee. Until the senior debt of the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer, the Company or such Subsidiary Guarantor is paid in full, any distribution to
which holders of the Senior Notes would be entitled but for the subordination provisions included in
the Intercreditor Agreement will instead be made to holders of senior debt of the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer, the Company or such Subsidiary Guarantor as their interests may appear. As a result, in the event
of insolvency of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Company or a Subsidiary Guarantor, holders of
senior debt of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Company or such Subsidiary Guarantor may recover
more, rateably, than the holders of Senior Notes, in respect of the Senior Note Guarantees.

In addition, the subordination provisions in the Intercreditor Agreement relating to the Senior Note
Guarantees provide:

- customary turnover provisions by the Trustee and the holders of the Senior Notes for the benefit
of the holders of senior debt of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Company or such
Subsidiary Guarantor;

- that if a payment default on any senior debt of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Company
or a Guarantor has occurred and is continuing, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Company
or such Guarantor may not make any payment in respect of its Senior Note Guarantee until
such default is cured or waived;

- that if any other default occurs and is continuing on any designated senior indebtedness that
permits the holders thereof to accelerate its maturity and the Trustee receives a notice of such
default, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Company or such Subsidiary Guarantor may not
make any payment in respect of the Senior Notes, or pursuant to its Senior Note Guarantee
(subject, in each case, to certain exceptions), until (among others) the earlier of the waiver or
cure of such default and 179 days after the date on which the applicable payment blockage
notice is received; and

- that the holders of the Senior Notes and the Trustee are prohibited, without the prior consent of
the Majority Senior Secured Creditors and/or the Majority Super Senior Creditors (each as
defined in the Intercreditor Agreement), from taking any enforcement action in relation to such
Senior Note Guarantee, except in certain circumstances and following certain standstill periods,
each as described in the Section entitled “Description of Other Indebtedness and Financing
_Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”_

75


-----

The Senior Indenture will also provide that, except under very limited circumstances, only the Trustee
has standing to bring an enforcement action in respect of the Senior Notes and the Senior Note
Guarantees. Moreover, the Intercreditor Agreement restricts and the Senior Indenture will restrict the
rights of holders of the Senior Notes to initiate insolvency proceedings or take legal actions against each
of the Guarantor and by accepting any Senior Note each such holder will be deemed to have agreed to
these restrictions. As a result of these restrictions, holders of the Senior Notes will have limited remedies
and recourse under the Senior Note Guarantees in the event of a default by the Issuer or a Guarantor.

In addition, the Senior Note Guarantees are, or will be, limited as set forth under “Certain Insolvency
_Law Considerations,” which limitations could be significant. See also “—Corporate benefit, financial_
_assistance laws, capital maintenance and other limitations on the Note Guarantees and the Collateral_
_may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Collateral.”_

**_The Notes and the Note Guarantee thereof will be structurally subordinated to the claims of creditors,_**
**_including depositors, trade creditors and preferred stockholders (if any), of our non-Guarantor_**
**_subsidiaries, and effectively subordinated to liabilities that are secured on assets that do not secure_**
**_the Notes._**

Certain of our subsidiaries will not guarantee the Notes. Our subsidiaries will not have any obligations
to pay amounts due under the Notes or to make funds available for that purpose unless they guarantee
the Notes or grant security interests in favor of the Notes. Generally, claims of creditors, including
depositors, trade creditors, lenders under bank financing arrangements and preferred stockholders (if
any) of non-Guarantor subsidiaries of the Company, are entitled to payments of their claims from the
assets of such subsidiaries before these assets are made available for distribution to their respective
parent entity or the creditors of the Issuer and the Guarantors. Accordingly, in the event that any nonGuarantor subsidiary of the Company becomes insolvent, is liquidated, reorganized or dissolved or is
otherwise wound up other than as part of a solvent transaction:

- the creditors of the Issuers and the Guarantors (including the holders of the Notes) will have no
right to proceed against the assets of such non-Guarantor subsidiary; and

- creditors of such non-Guarantor subsidiary, including depositors, trade creditors and preferred
stockholders (if any) will generally be entitled to payment in full from the sale or other disposal
of the assets of such subsidiary before either Issuer or any Guarantor, as a direct or indirect
shareholder (as applicable), will be entitled to receive any distributions from such subsidiary.

As such, the Notes and the Note Guarantees thereof will be structurally subordinated to the creditors,
including depositors, trade creditors and any preferred stockholders (if any) of the non-Guarantor
subsidiaries of the Company. A portion of this total amount is secured on property or assets that do not
form part of the Collateral securing the Notes and the Notes will be effectively subordinated to the
extent of the value of the property or assets securing such indebtedness.

In addition, the Indentures will permit these non-Guarantor subsidiaries, subject to certain limitations,
to incur substantial additional indebtedness, and such indebtedness may also be secured, including on
property or assets that do not form part of the Collateral securing the Notes. The Indentures will not
contain any limitation on the amount of other liabilities, such as deposits and trade payables that may
be incurred by these subsidiaries.

**_If the funding of the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities does not occur, the Issuers will be required_**
**_to redeem the Notes._**

The Group as of the date of this offering memorandum, is in the proceeds of negotiating and expect to
establish the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the proceeds of the New Term Facilities will be
used to refinance the Existing Senior Secured Credit Facilities. To the extent that we do not fund the
New Term Facilities (other than the AUD Term Facility if we do not refinance the Local Australian

76


-----

Facility) on or prior to the Escrow Longstop Date, we will be required to pay the Special Mandatory
Redemption Price, which is equal to 100% of the issue price of the applicable series of Notes, plus
accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the Special Mandatory
Redemption Date. See “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special
_Mandatory Redemption” and “Description of the Senior Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special_
_Mandatory Redemption.” In such event, you may not obtain the return you expect to receive on the_
Notes.

In addition, your decision to invest in the Notes is made at the time of purchase. Changes in the business
or financial position of the Group between the Issue Date and the Escrow Release Date, may have an
impact on our creditworthiness, and you will not be able to rescind your decision to invest in the Notes
as a result thereof.

**_The Note Guarantees will not be provided until after the Issue Date._**

Subject to and in accordance with the Agreed Security Principles, the Notes will not be guaranteed on
the Issue Date. Subject to and in accordance with the Agreed Security Principles, the Guarantors are
expected to provide a Note Guarantee by the Escrow Release Date. The Issuers may not be successful
in procuring such Note Guarantees within the time periods specified and the Note Guarantees will be
subject to the Agreed Security Principles, which could relieve certain subsidiaries of the Parent or the
Company, including any entity that may provide a guarantee under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities
Agreement, the obligation to provide a Note Guarantee, which could have a material adverse effect on
the credit support available to you in connection with your investment in the Notes.

**_The security interests in the Shared Collateral in favor of the Senior Notes will rank junior to the_**
**_security benefiting the holders of the Senior Secured Notes and the lenders under the New Senior_**
**_Secured Credit Facilities and your rights to enforce your security over the Shared Collateral are_**
**_limited._**

The Shared Collateral will be pledged to the Security Agent for the benefit of lenders under the Senior
Secured Credit Facilities Agreement and the holders of the Notes. Under the Intercreditor Agreement
and the security documents, the Senior Secured Notes and the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities will
be secured by first-ranking security interests in all of the Shared Collateral and the proceeds of any sale
of Shared Collateral on enforcement will be applied first to repay the Senior Secured Notes and all debt
under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement, certain hedging obligations and other future
obligations that is secured on the Shared Collateral on a first-ranking basis. Holders of the Senior Notes
may not be able to recover on such Shared Collateral because the holders of the Senior Secured Notes,
the lenders under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement, the counterparties to certain hedging
obligations and other future obligations that is secured on the Shared Collateral on a first-ranking basis
will have a prior claim on all proceeds realized from any enforcement of such Shared Collateral. See
also “—The Notes will be secured only to the extent of the value of the Collateral that has been granted
_as security for the Notes and future secured debt may be secured by certain assets that do not secure_
_the Notes. The value of the Collateral securing the Notes may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations_
_under the Notes and such Collateral may be reduced or diluted under certain circumstances.”_

**_The Notes will be secured only to the extent of the value of the Collateral that has been granted as_**
**_security for the Notes and future secured debt may be secured by certain assets that do not secure the_**
**_Notes. The value of the Collateral securing the Notes may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations_**
**_under the Notes and such Collateral may diluted under certain circumstances._**

The Notes will be secured only to the extent of the value of the Collateral described in this offering
memorandum. See “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Security” and “Description of the Senior
_Notes—Security.” The Collateral (other than Topco Collateral) also secures the obligations under the_
Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement on a first-ranking basis, and may secure additional debt
ranking pari passu with or junior to the Notes and the Note Guarantees, senior to the Senior Notes and

77


-----

Senior Notes Guarantees and certain debt on a super senior basis. The Indentures will permit the
granting of certain liens other than those in favor of the holders of the Notes on the Notes Collateral.
To the extent that holders of other indebtedness or third parties enjoy liens, including statutory liens,
whether or not permitted by the Indentures or the security documents, such holders or third parties may
have rights and remedies with respect to the Collateral which, if exercised, could reduce the proceeds
available to satisfy our obligations under the Notes. Moreover, under certain circumstances, we may be
permitted to issue additional Notes under the Indentures or other indebtedness that is secured on a basis
_pari passu to the Notes or the Note Guarantees in the future and holders of such additional Notes or_
other pari passu indebtedness would benefit from the same Collateral as the holders of the Notes. The
rights of the holders of the Notes may therefore be diluted by any increase in the debt secured by the
Collateral. Furthermore, in the case of the holders of the Senior Notes, although the Topco Collateral
will secure the Senior Notes and the Senior Note Guarantees thereof on a first-priority basis and will
not secure any obligations under the Senior Secured Notes or the Senior Secured Credit Facilities
Agreement, the Topco Collateral may secure additional debt ranking pari passu with or junior to the
Senior Notes, to the extent permitted by the terms of the Senior Indenture and the Intercreditor
Agreement.

If we default on the Notes, holders of the Notes will be secured only to the extent of the value of the
Collateral granted in favor of holders of the Notes. In addition, pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement,
the proceeds of an enforcement of the Collateral (other than the Topco Collateral, which will be applied
in repayment of the Senior Notes and the Senior Note Guarantees only) will be applied in repayment of
any Super Senior Liabilities, followed (to the extent the Collateral is a Shared Collateral) by the Senior
Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Note Guarantees and the Senior Secured Credit Facilities
Agreement, among others, followed by the Senior Notes and Senior Note Guarantees. In the event of
an enforcement of the Collateral, the proceeds from the sale of the assets underlying the Collateral may
not be sufficient to satisfy the Issuer’s obligations with respect to the Notes including as a result of
enforcement by creditors who are secured on the Shared Collateral on a first-ranking basis. No appraisal
of the value of the Collateral has been made in connection with this Offering. The value of the assets
underlying the Collateral will also depend on many factors, including, among other things, whether or
not the business is sold as a going concern, regulatory restrictions that could affect such sale, the ability
to sell the assets in an orderly sale and the condition of the economies in which operations are located
and the availability of buyers.

The Collateral that is pledged or assigned for the benefit of the holders of the Notes may provide for
only limited repayment of the Notes, in part because most of such Collateral may not be liquid and its
value to other parties may be less than their value to us. Likewise, we cannot assure you that the
Collateral will be saleable or, if saleable, that there will not be substantial delays in the liquidation
thereof. Furthermore, enforcement of the Collateral and any transfer of our operations may require, in
certain jurisdictions, governmental or other regulatory consents, approvals or filings or might otherwise
be challenged. Such consents, approvals or filings may take time to obtain or may not be obtained at
all. As a result, enforcement may be delayed, a temporary shutdown of operations may occur and the
value of the Collateral may be significantly decreased. Most of our assets do not secure the Notes and
it is possible that the value of the Notes Collateral will not be sufficient to cover the amount of
indebtedness secured by the Notes Collateral. With respect to the shares that will be pledged to secure
the Notes and the Note Guarantees thereof, such shares may also have limited value in the event of
bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar proceedings in relation to the entity’s shares that have been
pledged because all of the obligations of the entity whose shares have been pledged must first be
satisfied, leaving little or no remaining assets in the pledged entity. As a result, the creditors may not
recover anything of value in the case of an enforcement sale. In addition, the value of the Collateral
may decline over time.

To the extent the claims of the holders of the Notes exceed the value of the Collateral securing the Notes
and the Note Guarantees, those claims will generally rank equally with the claims of the holders of all
other existing and future senior unsecured debt ranking _pari passu with the Notes and the Note_

78


-----

Guarantees. As a result, if the value of the assets pledged as Collateral is less than the value of the
claims of the holders of the Notes, those claims may not be satisfied in full. In addition, not all of our
assets will secure the Notes, and the Indentures will allow the Company and its restricted subsidiaries
(in the case of the Senior Secured Indenture) or the Parent and its restricted subsidiaries (in the case of
the Senior Indenture)) to secure certain types of debt permitted to be incurred under the Indentures
(which may be structurally senior to the Notes and the Note Guarantees) with the property and assets
of the restricted subsidiaries that do not secure the Notes. The value of such assets and property could
be significant. If an event of default occurs and the obligations under the Notes are accelerated, the
Notes and the Note Guarantees will not benefit from the assets securing such secured debt and will rank
equally with the holders of other unsecured debt of the Company and its restricted subsidiaries (in the
case of the Senior Secured Indenture) or the Parent and its restricted subsidiaries (in the case of the
Senior Indenture)) with respect to any property or assets that is excluded from the Collateral securing
the Notes or such secured debt.

**_The granting of the Note Guarantees and security interests in connection with the issuance of the_**
**_Notes, or the incurrence of permitted debt in the future, may create or restart hardening or voidance_**
**_periods for such security interests in accordance with the laws applicable in certain jurisdictions._**

The granting of the Note Guarantees and security interests to secure the Notes may create hardening or
voidance periods for such Note Guarantees and security interests in certain jurisdictions. The granting
of shared security interests to secure future permitted debt may restart or reopen such hardening or
voidance periods in particular, as the Indentures will permit the release and retaking of security granted
in favor of the Notes in certain circumstances including in connection with the incurrence of future debt.
The applicable hardening or voidance period for these new security interests can run from the moment
each new security interest has been granted or perfected. At each time, if the security interest granted
or recreated were to be enforced before the end of the respective hardening or voidance period
applicable in such jurisdiction, it may be declared void or ineffective and/or it may not be possible to
enforce it. See “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”

The same rights may also apply in connection with the accession of further subsidiaries as Guarantors
or the granting of security interest over any assets and equity interests for the benefit of holders of the
Notes, as applicable.

**_Enforcing your rights as a holder of the Notes or under the Note Guarantees thereof or the Collateral_**
**_across multiple jurisdictions may prove difficult._**

The Issuers are organized under the laws of Jersey, the Guarantors are organized under the laws of
England and Wales, Australia, the Netherlands and Jersey and the Collateral will be granted by entities
incorporated under the laws of England and Wales and Jersey, and in the case of the Senior Secured
Notes, Australia, the Netherlands, Ireland and Cayman Islands. In the event of bankruptcy, insolvency,
administration or a similar event, proceedings could be initiated in any of these jurisdictions. Your rights
under the Notes, the Note Guarantees and/or the Collateral are likely to be subject to insolvency and
administrative laws of several jurisdictions, and there can be no assurance that you will be able to
effectively enforce your rights in such complex proceedings.

The insolvency, administration and other laws of the jurisdiction of organization of the Issuers, the
Guarantors or any third-party security provider may be materially different from, or conflict with, each
other and with the laws of the United States, including in the areas of rights of creditors, priority of
governmental and other creditors, the ability to obtain post-petition interest, the duration of proceeding
and preference periods. The application of these laws, and any conflict between them, could call into
question whether, and to what extent, the laws of any particular jurisdiction should apply, adversely
affect your ability to enforce your rights under the guarantees and the security documents in these
jurisdictions or limit any amounts that you may receive.

79


-----

**_The security interests in the Collateral have been, or will be, granted to the Security Agent rather_**
**_than directly to the holders of the Notes. The ability of the Security Agent to enforce the Collateral_**
**_may be restricted by local law._**

The security interests that will secure the obligations of the Issuers under the Notes and the obligations
of the Guarantors under the Note Guarantees have not been, and will not be, granted directly to the
holders of the Notes but to the Security Agent, and thus the holders of the Notes will not have any
independent power to enforce, or have recourse to, any of the security documents or to exercise any
rights or powers arising under the security documents except through the Security Agent as provided
by the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement. By accepting a Note, you will be deemed to have agreed
to these restrictions. As a result of these restrictions, holders of the Notes will have limited remedies
and recourse against us in the event of a default. See “Description of Other Indebtedness and Financing
_Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”_

In addition, the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the security interests is subject to mandatory
provisions of the laws of each jurisdiction in which security interests over the Collateral are taken. See
“Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”

**_Holders of the Notes may not control certain decisions regarding the Collateral._**

The Notes will be secured by the Collateral (including the Shared Collateral) which will also secure
(except in the case of the Topco Collateral) the obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities
Agreement and certain hedging liabilities. In addition, under the terms of the Indentures, we will be
permitted to incur significant additional _pari passu indebtedness and other obligations that may be_
secured by the same collateral. The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that the Security Agent, who
will serve as the security agents for the secured parties with respect to the Collateral (including the
Shared Collateral), will act only as provided for in the Intercreditor Agreement. The Intercreditor
Agreement will regulate the ability of the Trustee or the holders of the Notes to instruct the Security
Agent to take enforcement action. The Security Agent may refrain from enforcing the Collateral unless
otherwise instructed by the Instructing Group. For the purposes of enforcement, “Instructing Group”
means, subject to certain exceptions set out in “Description of Other Indebtedness and Financing
_Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement,” in the context of our capital structure upon consummation_
of the Transactions, more than 50% by value of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured
Notes, the total senior secured credit participations under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities
Agreement, certain hedge counterparties at that time, any other additional indebtedness that may be
secured on such collateral on a pari passu basis (the “Majority Senior Secured Creditors”). The
Majority Senior Secured Creditors may have interests that are different from the interests of holders of
the Notes and they may, subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, elect to pursue their
remedies under the Security Documents at a time when it would be disadvantageous for the holders of
the Notes to do so. See “Description of Other Indebtedness and Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor
_Agreement.”_

The lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility and the creditors in respect of certain priority hedging
obligations may have interests that are different from the interests of holders of the Notes and they may,
subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, elect to pursue their remedies under the Security
Documents at a time when it would be disadvantageous for the holders of the Notes to do so. In addition,
if the Security Agent sells Collateral consisting of the shares of the Issuer or any of its holding
companies or subsidiaries as a result of an enforcement action in accordance with the Intercreditor
Agreement, claims under the Notes and the Note Guarantees and the liens over any other assets of such
entities securing the Notes and the Note Guarantees may be released. In certain circumstances the
holders of the Senior Notes will be permitted to take enforcement action in respect of the Shared
Collateral if other creditors do not initiate enforcement.

**_Rights in the Collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect security interests in the_**
**_Collateral._**

Under applicable law, a security interest in certain tangible and intangible assets may in certain
circumstances only be properly perfected, and its priority retained, through certain actions undertaken
by the secured party or the grantor of the security, as applicable. The liens on the Collateral securing
the Notes may not be perfected with respect to the claims under the Notes, if we fail or are unable to
take the actions necessary to perfect any of these liens. Any failure to perfect any security interest in
the Collateral may result in the invalidity or unenforceability of the relevant security interest or
adversely affect the priority of such security interest in favor of the Notes against third parties, including
a trustee in bankruptcy and other creditors who claim a security interest in the same Collateral. The
Trustee and the Security Agent will not be under any obligation or responsibility to take any steps or
action to perfect, or ensure the perfection of, any such liens.

**_It is not possible to conduct lien searches in jurisdictions in which certain of the Guarantors are_**
**_located._**

It is not possible to conduct comprehensive lien searches in all of the jurisdictions in which the
Guarantors are organized. As a result, no assurance can be given that there does not exist one or more
liens securing significant obligations having priority on certain of the Collateral, which liens may
prevent or inhibit the Security Agent from foreclosing on the liens securing the Notes and may impair
the value of the Collateral. For example, we cannot guarantee that information provided to us in
response to company searches with the Registrar of Companies in England for security charges against
our subsidiaries organized in England are accurate and complete because, for example, information
which should have been registered with the Registrar of Companies may not have been so registered or
information that has been lodged for inclusion in our English subsidiary’s file may not have been fully
updated.

**_The Issuers and the Guarantors will have control over the Collateral, and the sale of particular assets_**
**_could reduce the pool of assets securing the Notes._**

The security documents relating to the Collateral will, subject to the terms of the Senior Secured Credit
Facilities Agreement (in respect of the Notes Collateral other than the Topco Collateral) and the
Indentures, allow the Issuers and the Guarantors to remain in possession of, retain control over, freely
operate, and collect, invest and dispose of any income from the Collateral. So long as no acceleration
event under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement or the Indentures is occurring or would
result therefrom, the Issuers and the Guarantors, may, among other things, without any consent by the
Security Agent, conduct ordinary course activities with respect to the Collateral, such as selling,
factoring or otherwise disposing of Collateral and making ordinary course cash payments, including
repayments of indebtedness in accordance with the provisions of the Indentures and the Senior Secured
Credit Facilities Agreement (in respect of the Collateral other than the Topco Collateral). Any of these
activities could reduce the value of the Collateral and consequently the amounts payable to holders of
the Notes from the proceeds of any sale of the Collateral in the case of an enforcement.

**_There are circumstances other than the repayment or discharge of the Notes under which the Note_**
**_Guarantees or the Collateral securing the Notes will be released automatically without your consent_**
**_or the Trustee or the Security Agent obtaining your further consent._**

Under a variety of circumstances, the Collateral securing the Notes will be released automatically other
than upon full repayment of the Notes. These include (among others) releases:

- in connection with certain sales or other dispositions of Collateral that are permitted in
accordance with the Indentures;

81


-----

- the property and assets of a Guarantor that is released from its Note Guarantee pursuant to the
terms of the Indentures;

- the property and assets of any Restricted Subsidiary designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary;

- in connection with certain permitted reorganizations or in connection with certain qualified
receivables financings;

- in respect of the security interests in the shares of the Company or the Parent in the event of an
initial public offering of the Company or the Parent (as applicable); and

- otherwise in accordance with the Indentures, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement.

See “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Security—Release of Liens” and “Description of the
_Senior Notes—Security—Release of Liens” for a description of the provisions governing releases of_
Collateral under the Indenture.

In addition, under a variety of circumstances, the Note Guarantees will be released automatically other
than upon full repayment of the Notes. These include (among others) releases:

- in connection with certain sales or other dispositions that are permitted in accordance with the
Indentures where the Guarantor ceases to be a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of the sale or
other disposition;

- so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, to the extent that such
Guarantor’s guarantee under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement is released and
such Guarantor is not guaranteeing certain other kinds of debt;

- if such Guarantor is designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary;

- in connection with certain mergers, certain solvent liquidations, certain regulatory redress
liability management exercises or certain permitted reorganizations; and

- otherwise in accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement.

See “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—The Note Guarantees—Note Guarantees Release” and
“Description of the Senior Notes—The Note Guarantees—Note Guarantees Release” for a description
of the provisions governing releases of Note Guarantees under the Indenture.

The Indentures will also permit us to designate one or more restricted subsidiaries that are Notes
Guarantors as unrestricted subsidiaries. If we designate a Guarantor as an unrestricted subsidiary for
purposes of the Indenture, all of the liens on the Collateral owned by such subsidiary and any Note
Guarantee by such subsidiary will be released under the Indentures, subject to certain conditions.
Designation of an unrestricted subsidiary as such will reduce the aggregate value of the Collateral
securing the Notes to the extent of liens securing the shares of such unrestricted subsidiary or of its
subsidiaries.

**_Certain actions in respect of defaults taken under the Indentures by beneficial owners with short_**
**_positions in excess of their interests in the Notes will be disregarded._**

By acceptance of the Notes, each holder of Notes agrees, in connection with certain notices of Default
(as defined under “Description of the Senior Secured Notes” and “Description of the Senior Notes”),
notices of acceleration or instructions to the Trustee to provide certain notices of Default, notices of
acceleration or take any other action (a “Noteholder Direction”), to (i) deliver a written representation

82


-----

to the relevant Issuer and the Trustee that such holder and any of its affiliates acting in concert with it
in connection with its investment in the Notes (other than screened affiliates) are not (or, in the case
such holder is a clearing system or its respective nominee, that such holder is being instructed solely by
beneficial owners that (together with such affiliates) are not) Net Short (as defined under “Description
_of the Senior Secured Notes” and “Description of the Senior Notes”) and (ii) provide the relevant Issuer_
with such other information as such Issuer may reasonably request from time to time in order to verify
the accuracy of such holder’s representation within five business days of request therefor. Holders of
the Notes, including holders that have hedged their exposure to the Notes in the ordinary course and not
for speculative purposes, may not be able to make such representations or provide the requested
additional information. These restrictions may impact a holder’s ability to participate in Noteholder
Directions.

**_The insolvency laws of England and Wales and other applicable jurisdictions may not be as favorable_**
**_to you as the insolvency laws of the United States or those of another jurisdiction with which you are_**
**_familiar; other limitations on the Note Guarantees and the Security Interests in the Collateral,_**
**_including fraudulent conveyance statutes, may adversely affect their validity and enforceability._**

On the Issue Date, the Issuers’ obligations under the Notes will not be guaranteed and secured by
security interests over the relevant Escrow Accounts. The Issuers and Midco 3 are organized under the
laws of Jersey and the Parent, the Company, Ardonagh Finco plc and Ardonagh Services Limited are
organized under the laws of England and Wales. The SFA Borrowers will be incorporated in the
Netherlands, Australia and Delaware, United States. See also “—Note Guarantees will not be provided
_until after the Issue Date” and “—Enforcing your rights as a holder of the Notes or under the Note_
_Guarantees thereof or the Collateral across multiple jurisdictions may prove difficult.” There is a_
rebuttable presumption that the “centre of main interest” as defined in the Council of the European
Union Regulation No. 2015/848 on Insolvency Proceedings is the jurisdiction where the registered
office is situated. The insolvency laws of certain jurisdictions may not be as favorable to your interests
as the laws of the United States or other jurisdictions with which you are familiar. In the event that any
one or more of the Issuers, the Guarantors or any other of the Parent’s subsidiaries experiences financial
difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or
similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings.

Although laws differ among the jurisdictions, in general, applicable fraudulent transfer and conveyance
and equitable principles, insolvency laws and limitations on the enforceability of judgments obtained
in courts in such jurisdictions could limit the enforceability of the Notes against the relevant Issuer, the
enforceability of a Note Guarantee against a Guarantor and the enforceability of the security interests
in the Collateral. In certain circumstances the court may also void the security interest in the Collateral
or the Note Guarantees if the company is close to or near insolvency. The following discussion of
fraudulent transfer, conveyance and insolvency law, although an overview, describes generally
applicable terms and principles, which are defined under the relevant jurisdiction’s fraudulent transfer
and insolvency statutes.

In an insolvency proceeding, it is possible that creditors of the Guarantors or the appointed insolvency
administrator may challenge the guarantees and the security interests in the Collateral and intercompany
obligations generally, as preferences, transaction at an undervalue, invalid charges, fraudulent transfers
or conveyances or on other grounds. If so, such laws may permit a court, if it makes certain findings,
to:

- avoid or invalidate all or a portion of a Guarantor’s obligations under its Note Guarantee or the
security interests provided by such security provider;

- direct that the relevant Issuer and the holders of the Notes return any amounts paid under a Note
Guarantee or any security interest in the Collateral to the relevant Guarantor or security provider
or to a fund for the benefit of the Guarantor’s or security provider’s creditors; and

83


-----

- take other action that is detrimental to you.

If we cannot satisfy our obligations under the Notes and any Note Guarantee or security interest in the
Collateral is found to be a preference, transaction at an undervalue, fraudulent transfer or conveyance
or is otherwise set aside, we cannot assure you that we can ever repay in full any amounts outstanding
under the Notes. In addition, the liability of each Guarantor or security provider under its Note
Guarantee or the security interests in the Collateral is limited to the amount that will result in such
guarantee or Security Interests not constituting a fraudulent conveyance or improper corporate
distribution or otherwise being set aside. The amount recoverable from the Guarantors and security
providers under the Security Documents is also limited. However, there can be no assurance as to what
standard a court would apply in making a determination of the maximum liability of each. There is also
the possibility that the entire Note Guarantee or security interest may be set aside, in which case the
entire liability may be extinguished. See also “—Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws, capital
_maintenance and other limitations on the Note Guarantees and the Collateral may adversely affect the_
_validity and enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Collateral.”_

In order to initiate any of these actions under fraudulent transfer or other applicable principles, courts
would, for example, need to find that, at the time the Note Guarantees were issued or the security
interests in the Collateral created and in case such transaction occurred within a specific time period
before the opening of insolvency proceedings, the Notes Guarantor or security provider:

- issued such Note Guarantee or created such security interest with the intent of hindering,
delaying or defrauding current or future creditors or with a desire to prefer some creditors over
others, or created such security after its insolvency;

- issued such Note Guarantee or created such security interest in a situation where a prudent
business person as a shareholder of such Guarantor or security provider would have contributed
equity to such Guarantor or security provider or where the relevant beneficiary of the Note
Guarantees or security interest knew or should have known that the Guarantor or security
provider was insolvent or a filing for insolvency had been made; or

- received less than reasonably equivalent value for incurring the debt represented by the Note
Guarantees or security interest in the Collateral on the basis that the Note Guarantees or security
interest in the Collateral was incurred for our benefit, and only indirectly the Guarantor’s or
security provider’s benefit, or on some other basis and (i) was insolvent or rendered insolvent
by reason of the issuance of the Note Guarantees or the creation of the security interest, or
subsequently became insolvent for other reasons; (ii) was engaged, or was about to engage, in
a business transaction for which the Guarantor’s or security provider’s assets were
unreasonably small; or (iii) intended to incur, or believed it would incur, debts beyond its ability
to make required payments as and when they would become due.

Different jurisdictions evaluate insolvency on various criteria, but a Guarantor or security provider
generally may, in different jurisdictions, be considered insolvent at the time it issued a Note Guarantee
or created any security interest in the Collateral if:

- its liabilities exceed the fair market value of its assets;

- it cannot pay its debts as and when they become due; or

- the present saleable value of its assets is less than the amount required to pay its total existing
debts and liabilities, including contingent and prospective liabilities, as they mature or become
absolute.

Although we believe that the Issuers and the Group are solvent, and will be so after giving effect to the
Transactions, there can be no assurance as to which standard a court would apply in determining

84


-----

whether a Guarantor or security provider was “insolvent” as of the date such Note Guarantee was issued
or the security interests in the Collateral were created or that, regardless of the method of valuation, a
court would not determine that a Guarantor or security provider was insolvent on that date, or that a
court would not determine, regardless of whether or not a Guarantor or security provider was insolvent
on the date its Note Guarantee was issued or the security interests in the Collateral were created, that
payments to holders of the Notes constituted fraudulent transfers on other grounds.

For an overview of certain insolvency laws and enforceability issues as they relate to the Note
Guarantees and Security Interests, see “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”

**_Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws, capital maintenance and other limitations on the Note_**
**_Guarantees and the Collateral may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Note_**
**_Guarantees and the Collateral._**

Certain of the Guarantors are organized under the laws of England and Wales, the Netherlands,
Australia and Jersey, and the Collateral will be granted by entities incorporated under the laws of
England and Wales and Jersey, and in the case of the Senior Secured Notes, Australia, the Netherlands,
Ireland and Cayman Islands. Enforcement of the obligations under a Note Guarantee against, and/or
any Collateral provided by, as applicable, any such Guarantor will be subject to certain defenses
available to the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor, as the case may be. These laws and defenses may
include those that relate to fraudulent conveyance, financial assistance, corporate benefit, capital
maintenance, liquidity maintenance or similar laws as well as regulations or defenses affecting the rights
of creditors generally, particularly by limiting the amounts recoverable under the Note Guarantees and
Collateral, as applicable, and the amounts recoverable thereunder are limited to the maximum amount
that can be guaranteed or secured by a particular Guarantor or security provider under the applicable
laws of each jurisdiction, to the extent that the granting of such Note Guarantee or Collateral is not in
the relevant Guarantor’s or security provider’s corporate interests, or the burden of such Note Guarantee
or Collateral exceeds the benefit to the relevant Guarantor or security provider, or such Note Guarantee
or Collateral would be in breach of capital maintenance, liquidity maintenance or thin capitalization
rules or any other general statutory laws and/or would cause the directors of such subsidiary Guarantor
or security provider to contravene their fiduciary duties and incur civil or criminal liability. See
“Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Security—General” and “Description of the Senior Notes—
_Security—General.”_

As a result, any Guarantor’s or security provider’s liability under its Note Guarantee or the Collateral
could be materially reduced or eliminated, depending upon the law and contractual enforcement
restrictions applicable to it. This could lead to a situation in which such Note Guarantee or such
Collateral cannot be enforced at all. It is possible that a Guarantor or security provider, or any of their
creditors, or the bankruptcy trustee or other insolvency office holder in the case of a
bankruptcy/insolvency of a Guarantor or security provider, may contest the validity and enforceability
of the Guarantor’s Note Guarantee or the Collateral provided by the security provider on any of the
above grounds and that the applicable court may determine that the Note Guarantee or Collateral should
be limited or voided. To the extent that any limitations on the relevant Note Guarantees or Collateral
apply, the Notes would be to that extent effectively subordinated to all liabilities of the applicable Notes
Guarantor or security provider, including trade payables of such Guarantor or security provider. Future
Note Guarantees or Collateral may be subject to similar limitations. See “Certain Insolvency Law
_Considerations.”_

**_Transfer of the Notes will be restricted, which may adversely affect the value of the Notes._**

Because the Notes will not be, and are not required to be, registered under the U.S. Securities Act or
the securities laws of any other jurisdiction, they may not be offered or sold in the United States except
to QIBs in accordance with Rule 144A, to non-U.S. persons outside the United States in accordance
with Regulation S or pursuant to another exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the

85


-----

registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and all other applicable laws. These restrictions
may limit the ability of investors to resell the Notes. It is the obligation of investors in the Notes to
ensure that all offers and sales of the Notes in the United States and other countries comply with
applicable securities laws. See “Notice to Investors.”

**_The Indentures will not be qualified under the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the_**
**_“TIA”)._**

The Indentures with respect to the Notes offered hereby are not required to be, nor will they be, qualified
under the TIA and will not incorporate or include or be subject to any of the provisions of the TIA.
Consequently, the holders of the Notes will not be entitled to the protections provided under the TIA to
holders of debt securities issued under a qualified indenture, including those respecting preferential
collections by the Trustee or conflicting interests of the Trustee. See “Description of the Senior Secured
_Notes” and “Description of the Senior Notes.” For example, the eligibility and disqualification_
requirements of the TIA will not apply and, if they did, the Trustee would not be eligible to act as trustee
under the Indentures if it was deemed to be under common control with the relevant Issuer. See “Related
_Party Transactions.”_

**_The Notes will initially be held in book-entry form, and therefore you must rely on the procedures of_**
**_the relevant clearing systems to exercise any rights and remedies._**

The Notes will initially only be issued in global certificated form and held through DTC (in the case of
the Dollar Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Notes) and Euroclear and Clearstream (in the case of
the Euro Senior Secured Notes). Interests in the global notes will trade in book-entry form only, and the
Notes in definitive registered form, or definitive registered notes, will be issued in exchange for bookentry interests only in very limited circumstances. Owners of book-entry interests will not be considered
owners or holders of the Notes. The nominee for DTC will be the sole registered holder of the global
notes representing the Dollar Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Notes and the common depositary
for Euroclear and Clearstream will be the sole registered holder of the global notes representing the
Euro Senior Secured Notes.

Payments of principal, interest and other amounts owing on or in respect of the global notes representing
the Notes will be made to one or more paying agents, which will make payments to DTC, Euroclear
and Clearstream, as applicable. Thereafter, these payments will be credited to participants’ accounts
that hold book-entry interests in the global notes representing the Notes and credited by such
participants to indirect participants. After payment to the nominee for DTC and the common depositary
for Euroclear and Clearstream, the Issuers will have no responsibility or liability for the payment of
interest, principal or other amounts to the owners of book-entry interests. Accordingly, if investors own
a book-entry interest, they must rely on the procedures of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream, and if
investors are not participants in DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream, they must rely on the procedures of the
participant through which they own their interest, to exercise any rights and obligations of a holder of
the Notes under the Indentures, as applicable.

Unlike the holders of the Notes themselves, owners of book-entry interests will not have the direct right
to act upon the Issuers’ solicitations for consents, requests for waivers or other actions from holders of
the Notes. Instead, if an investor owns a book-entry interest, it will be permitted to act only to the extent
it has received appropriate proxies to do so from DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream. The procedures
implemented for the granting of such proxies may not be sufficient to enable such investor to vote on a
timely basis. Similarly, upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Indenture, unless and until
definitive registered notes are issued in respect of all book-entry interests, if investors own book-entry
interests, they will be restricted to acting through DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream. The procedures to
be implemented through DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream may not be adequate to ensure the timely
exercise of rights under the Notes. See “Book-Entry, Delivery and Form.”

**_There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes_**
**_may be limited._**

We cannot assure you as to:

- the liquidity of any market in the Notes;

- your ability to sell your Notes; or

- the prices at which you would be able to sell your Notes.

Future trading prices of the Notes will depend on many factors, including, among other things,
prevailing interest rates, our operating results and the market for similar securities. The liquidity of a
trading market for the Notes may be adversely affected by a general decline in the market for similar
securities. Historically, the market for non-investment grade securities has been subject to disruptions
that have caused substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to the Notes. Any such disruption
may have a negative effect on you, as a holder of Notes, regardless of our prospects and financial
performance.

**_Investors may not be able to recover in civil proceedings for U.S. securities law violations._**

Each of the Issuers and the Guarantors (other than the SFA Borrower that will be incorporated in
Delaware) and their respective subsidiaries are organized outside the United States. The directors,
managers and/or executive officers of the Issuer and the Guarantors are non-residents of the United
States. Although we and the Guarantors will submit to the jurisdiction of certain New York courts in
connection with any action under US securities laws, you may be unable to effect service of process
within the United States on these directors, managers and executive officers. In addition, as all of the
assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors and their respective subsidiaries and those of their directors and
executive officers are located outside of the United States, you may be unable to enforce judgments
obtained in the US courts against them. Moreover, actions of the Issuers and the Guarantors may not be
subject to the provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States. The United States is not
currently bound by a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other
than arbitral awards, rendered in civil and commercial matters with England and Wales. There is,
therefore, doubt as to the enforceability in England and Wales of US securities laws in an action to
enforce a US judgment in such jurisdictions. In addition, the enforcement in England and Wales of any
judgment obtained in a US court, whether or not predicated solely upon US federal securities laws, will
be subject to certain conditions. There is also doubt that a court in England and Wales would have the
requisite power or authority to grant remedies sought in an original action brought in such jurisdictions
on the basis of US securities laws violations. See “Service of Process and Enforcement of Civil
_Liberties.”_

**_The Issuers may not be able to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control. In addition, under_**
**_certain circumstances, the Issuer may have the right to purchase all outstanding Notes in connection_**
**_with a tender offer, even if certain holders do not consent to the tender._**

Upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a change of control under the Indenture, the Issuers
will be required to make an offer to purchase all the then outstanding Notes at a price in cash equal to
101% of the principal amount thereof, plus any accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if
any, to, but excluding, the date of purchase. In such a situation, the Issuers may not have enough funds
to purchase all of the then outstanding Notes that are tendered under any such offer. If a significant
principal amount of Notes is tendered, the Issuers will likely have to obtain financing to pay for the
tendered Notes. However, the Issuers may not be able to obtain such financing on acceptable terms, if
at all. A change of control may also result in a mandatory prepayment under the Senior Secured Credit
Facilities Agreement and agreements governing any future indebtedness. The repurchase of the Notes
pursuant to such an offer could cause a default under such indebtedness, even if the change of control

87


-----

itself does not. Any failure by the Issuer to offer to purchase the Notes upon a change of control would
constitute a default under the Indenture, which would, in turn, constitute a default under the Senior
Secured Credit Facilities Agreement. See “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Change of
_Control” and “Description of the Senior Notes—Change of Control.”_

The change of control provision that will be contained in the Indentures may not necessarily afford you
protection in the event of certain important corporate events, including reorganizations, restructurings,
mergers, recapitalizations or other similar transactions involving us that may adversely affect you,
because such corporate events may not involve a shift in voting power or beneficial ownership or, even
if they do, may not constitute a change of control as defined in the Indenture.

In addition, in connection with any tender offer for the Notes, if holders of not less than 90% in
aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes
in such tender offer and the relevant Issuer, or any third party making such a tender offer in lieu of such
Issuer, purchases, all of the Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such holders, such Issuer or
such third party will have the right to redeem the Notes that remain outstanding in whole, but not in
part, following such purchase at a price equal to the price offered to each other holder of Notes (which
may be less than par and may exclude any early tender or incentive fee). See “Description of the Senior
_Secured Notes—Optional Redemption—Optional Redemption upon any Tender Offer” and_
“Description of the Senior Notes—Optional Redemption—Optional Redemption upon any Tender
_Offer.”_

**_The term “all or substantially all” in the context of a change of control has no clearly established_**
**_meaning under relevant law and is subject to judicial interpretation such that it may not be certain_**
**_that a change of control has occurred or will occur._**

The definition of “change of control” in the Indentures includes (with certain exceptions) a disposition
of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its restricted subsidiaries (taken as a whole)
to any person (in the case of the Senior Secured Indenture)) and the Parent and its restricted subsidiaries
(taken as a whole) to any person (in the case of the Senior Indenture). Although there is a limited body
of case law interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all,” it has no clearly established meaning under
relevant law, varies according to the facts and circumstances of the subject transaction and is subject to
judicial interpretation. Accordingly, in certain circumstances, there may be a degree of uncertainty in
ascertaining whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of
the assets of a person, and therefore it may be unclear whether a change of control has occurred and
whether the Issuers are required to make an offer to repurchase the Notes.

**_If the Notes are redeemed early, an investor may not be able to reinvest such proceeds in a_**
**_comparable security._**

In the event that the Notes are redeemed early in accordance with “Description of the Senior Secured
_Notes—Optional Redemption” and “Description of the Senior Notes—Optional Redemption” and_
depending on prevailing market conditions at the time, an investor who receives proceeds due to such
an early redemption may not be able to reinvest such proceeds in a comparable security at an effective
interest rate as high as that carried by the Notes.

**_Credit ratings may not reflect all risks, are not recommendations to buy or hold securities and may_**
**_be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time._**

One or more independent credit rating agencies may assign credit ratings to the Notes. The credit ratings
address our ability to perform our obligations under the terms of the Notes and credit risks in
determining the likelihood that payments will be made when due under the Notes. The ratings may not
reflect the potential impact of all risks related to the structure, market, additional risk factors discussed
above and other factors that may affect the value of the Notes. A credit rating is not a recommendation
to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal by the rating

88


-----

agency at any time. No assurances can be given that a credit rating will remain constant for any given
period of time or that a credit rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by the credit rating
agency if, in its judgment, circumstances in the future so warrant. A suspension, reduction or withdrawal
at any time of the credit rating assigned to the Notes by one or more of the credit rating agencies may
adversely affect the cost and terms and conditions of our financings and could adversely affect the value
and trading of the Notes.

**_Certain covenants and events of default will be suspended if we receive investment grade ratings._**

The Indentures will provide that, if at any time following the Issue Date, the Notes issued thereunder
receive two of the following investment grade ratings: Baa3 or better by Moody’s, and/or BBB– or
better by S&P, and/or BBB– or better by Fitch, and no default or event of default has occurred and is
continuing, then beginning that day and continuing until such time as such Notes are no longer rated
investment grade by two of the three ratings agencies, certain covenants will cease to be applicable to
such Notes. See “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Certain Covenants—Suspension of
_Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status” and “Description of the Senior Notes—Certain_
_Covenants—Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status.” At any time when_
these covenants are suspended, we will be able to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness,
pay cash dividends and redeem subordinated indebtedness without restriction, each of which may
conflict with the interests of holders of the Notes. There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever
achieve an investment grade rating or that any such rating if achieved will be maintained.

**_The Notes may not become or remain listed on the Exchange._**

Application will be made to The International Stock Exchange Authority Limited for the listing of and
permission to deal in the Notes on the Official List of the Exchange. However, there can be no assurance
that the Notes will become or remain listed. If the Issuers cannot maintain the listing on the Official
List of the Exchange and the admission to dealing on the Official List thereof, or if it becomes unduly
burdensome to make or maintain such listing, the Issuers may cease to make or maintain such listing
on the Official List of the Exchange.

Listing of any of the Notes on the Official List of the Exchange does not imply that a public offering of
any of the Notes in the Channel Islands has been authorized. Although no assurance is made as to the
liquidity of the Notes as a result of listing on the Official List of the Exchange or another recognized
listing exchange for comparable issuers, failure to be approved for listing or the delisting of the Notes
from the Official List of the Exchange or another listing exchange may have an adverse effect on a
holder’s ability to resell Notes in the secondary market.

A failure to list the Notes may also have adverse UK withholding tax consequences for the Issuers. See
“Certain Tax Considerations—United Kingdom Tax Considerations–Interest on the Notes.” Under the
Indentures, the Issuers will be required to gross up payments to investors which are subject to UK
withholding tax, subject to certain exceptions. See “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—
_Withholding Taxes” and “Description of the Senior Notes—Withholding Taxes.” It may be possible in_
certain circumstances that a gross up for withholding taxes on amounts paid in respect of the Notes is
not required under the Indentures. In cases where the Issuers are required to gross up payments to a
holder of the Notes, this will reduce the available funds of the Issuers and therefore may reduce the
ability of the Issuers to comply with its payment obligations in respect of the Notes.

**_Investors may face foreign exchange risks by investing in the Notes._**

The Dollar Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Notes will be denominated and payable in U.S. dollars
and the Euro Senior Secured Notes will be denominated and payable in euros. If investors measure their
investment returns by reference to a currency other than U.S. dollar (in the case of the Dollar Senior
Notes and the Senior Notes) or euro (in the case of the Euro Senior Secured Notes), an investment in
the Notes will entail foreign exchange-related risks due to, among other factors, possible significant

89


-----

changes in the values of the U.S. dollar or euro relative to the currency by reference to which investors
measure the return on their investments because of economic, political and other factors over which we
have no control. Depreciation of the U.S. dollar or euro against the currency by reference to which
investors measure the return on their investments could cause a decrease in the effective yield of the
Notes below their stated coupon rates and could result in a loss to investors when the return on the Notes
is translated into the currency by reference to which the investors measure the return on their
investments.

**_The Notes may be treated as issued with original issue discount for U.S. federal income tax purposes._**

If the stated principal amount of the Notes exceeds their issue price by an amount greater than or equal
to a statutorily defined de minimis amount, then the Notes will be considered to be issued OID for U.S.
federal income tax purposes in an amount equal to the excess of the stated principal amount over the
issue price of the Notes. If the Notes are issued with OID, a holder subject to U.S. federal income
taxation generally will be required to include such OID in gross income (as ordinary income) for U.S.
federal income tax purposes as it accrues (on a constant yield to maturity basis), in advance of the
receipt of cash attributable to such OID, irrespective of such holder’s regular method of tax accounting.
See “Certain Tax Considerations—Certain United States Federal Income Tax Considerations—
_Original Issue Discount.”_

**_The interests of our principal shareholders may conflict with your interests._**

The interests of our principal shareholders, in certain circumstances, may conflict with your interests as
holders of the Notes. HPS and MDP, together, indirectly own the majority of the Company’s shares. As
of the date of this offering memorandum, 31.15% of the voting interests in Tara Topco Limited are
indirectly owned by funds managed, advised and/or controlled by HPS or its affiliates and 67.48% are
indirectly owned by entities affiliated with MDP. See “Shareholders.” As a result, HPS and MDP,
together, have, and will continue to have, directly or indirectly, the power, among other things, to affect
our legal and capital structure and our day-to-day operations, as well as the ability to elect and change
our management and to approve any other changes to our operations. For example, the shareholders
could vote to cause us to incur additional indebtedness, to sell certain material assets or make dividends,
in each case, so long as the Indenture, the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement and the
Intercreditor Agreement so permit. The incurrence of additional indebtedness would increase our debt
service obligations and the sale of certain assets could reduce our ability to generate revenue, each of
which could adversely affect holders of the Notes. Additionally, investment funds managed by MDP
are indirect equity holders of, and indirectly control, Ankura Trust Company, LLC, which is the Trustee
and investment funds managed by HPS have a minority, non-controlling interest in, and are debt
investors in, Ankura Trust Company, LLC. See “Related Party Transactions.” As a result, MDP or HPS
could attempt to cause Ankura Trust Company, LLC, acting as Trustee, to act in a manner that could
conflict with your interests as holders of the Notes, in which case Ankura Trust Company, LLC might
need to resign.

**USE OF PROCEEDS**

We intend to use the proceeds of the Offering, together with certain proceeds from drawings under the
New Term Facilities and certain proceeds from the Retail Transaction, (i) to fund the Existing Notes
Redemption; (ii) to repay drawn amounts under the Existing Senior Secured Credit Facilities; (iii) to
pay the fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Transactions, including fees and expenses
incurred in connection with the Offering and redemption costs incurred in connection with the Existing
Notes Redemption; and (v) for general corporate purposes, including one or more acquisition
opportunities in the near term and funding cash to our balance sheet. See “Capitalization.”

The estimated sources and uses of the funds from the Offering as estimated as of the date of this offering
memorandum using the exchange rates described are shown in the table below. Actual amounts will
vary from estimated amounts depending on several factors, including actual dates of the Existing Notes
Redemption and the repayment of the Existing Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the amount outstanding
under the Existing Senior Secured Facilities at the time it is repaid, the actual rate at which the U.S.
dollar, euro and Australian dollar proceeds are exchanged for pounds sterling on the dates of the various
transactions, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, the actual date of completion of the Retail
Transaction (if any) and differences in the actual amount of fees, expenses and other costs compared to
our estimates. The figures below have been subject to rounding adjustments and, as a result, the totals
of the sources of funds varies from the actual arithmetic total.

(1) Represents the sterling-equivalent aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes offered hereby (calculated using an
exchange rate of U.S.$1.25 to £1.00 and €1.15 to £1.00).

(2) Represents the sterling-equivalent gross proceeds from the New Term Facilities (calculated using exchange rates of U.S.$1.25 to
£1.00, €1.15 to £1.00 and AUD1.80 to £1.00). Because the Retail Transaction is expected to complete after the entry into the New
Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the refinancing of the Existing Senior Secured Credit Facilities, we expect an additional £430
million (equivalent) of net indebtedness under the USD Facility B under the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities to be drawn and
outstanding prior to the expected completion of the Retail Transaction.

(3) Represents the expected net cash proceeds from the Retail Transaction. The Retail Transaction is subject to the satisfaction of
certain closing conditions, including customary regulatory and antitrust approvals from both the FCA and the CMA. We expect
completion of the Retail Transaction to occur in the second or third quarter of 2024. We expect a significant portion of the cash
proceeds from the Retail Transaction will be applied, subject to certain exceptions and limits, in mandatorily prepaying at par a
portion of our New Senior Secured Credit Facilities. See “Summary—Recent Developments—Retail Transaction.” The Retail
Transaction is subject to customary transaction risks. “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—The Retail
_Transaction may be delayed or may not proceed to completion._

(4) Represents the principal amount outstanding under the Existing Notes (including capitalized PIK interest) and calculated using an
exchange rate of U.S.$1.25 to £1.00. Excludes the premium payable in connection with the Existing Notes Redemption and
estimated accrued and unpaid interest to an assumed date of redemption. The principal amount of Existing Notes shown here for
the Existing Notes Redemption was calculated using a different currency exchange rate than the rate in our September 30, 2023
statement of financial position. See “Capitalization.”

(5) Represents the repayment of the Existing Senior Secured Credit Facilities assuming the Existing Senior Secured Credit Facilities
are fully drawn as of the date of repayment. As of December 31, 2023, approximately £283 million of commitments under the
Existing Senior Secured Credit Facilities remained undrawn.

(6) Represents the estimated amount of cash resulting from the Transactions and the Retail Transaction which will be available for
general corporate purposes, which we currently expect to be used for future acquisitions and to be funded as additional cash to our
balance sheet.

(7) Represents the estimated fees and expenses associated with the Offering and the other Transactions, including underwriting,
financing (including any original issue discount), financial advisory, legal, accounting, ratings advisory and other transaction costs
and professional fees, redemption premium and other financing fees). The actual amount of transaction fees and expenses may
differ from the estimated amount depending on several factors.

assuming that the Retail Transaction has occurred (calculated using an exchange rates of U.S.$1.25 to £1.00, €1.15 to £1.00 and

certain exceptions and limits, in mandatorily prepaying at par a portion of our New Senior Secured Credit Facilities. Because the
Retail Transaction is expected to complete after the entry into the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the refinancing of the

**MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND**
**RESULTS OF OPERATIONS**

_On May 31, 2022, The Ardonagh Group Limited, the entity at which we previously reported our results,_
_merged into the Group’s new indirect parent company, Tara Topco Limited. Following this merger, on_
_June 1, 2022, AGHL acquired Ardonagh New Midco 3 Limited, including the Group companies that_
_were previously owned by The Ardonagh Group Limited, and became the reporting entity for the Group._
_AGHL’s first reporting period included all transactions since its incorporation on December 8, 2021_
_to December 31, 2022. The nine-month period ended September 30, 2022, however, only includes four_
_months of the results of operations and cash flows of the consolidated operations of AGHL due to the_
_timing of the Tara Transactions. Accordingly, AGHL’s results during any period ended in 2022 are not_
_comparable to any other period presented. We have accounted for the Tara Transactions using the_
_acquisition method of accounting under IFRS 3, Business Combinations, applying purchase accounting_
_adjustments that resulted, among others, in the recognition of intangibles (including goodwill) and_
_deferred tax liabilities in our financial information. Due to the application of the acquisition method of_
_accounting, the Unaudited Interim Financial Statements of AGHL are not directly comparable to the_
_Audited Financial Statements of the Parent. See “Presentation of Financial Information—Differences_
_in the Financial Statements of AGHL and the Parent.”_

_To aid comparability between periods, the_ _following summary historical (i) consolidated statement of_
_financial position as of December 31, 2022 and the consolidated statement of profit or loss and_
_consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2022 have been derived from_
_the 2022 Audited Financial Statements of the Parent which have been prepared in accordance with_
_IFRS and are included elsewhere in this offering memorandum, (ii) consolidated statement of profit or_
_loss and consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2021 have been derived_
_from the 2021 Audited Financial Statements of the Parent which have been prepared in accordance_
_with IFRS and are included elsewhere in this offering memorandum, (iii) consolidated statement of_
_financial position as of December 31, 2021 have been derived from the comparative column in the_
_2022 Audited Financial Statements of the Parent, due to the restatement of trade and other receivables_
_and retained losses, (iv) consolidated statement of financial position as of December 31, 2020 and the_
_consolidated statement of profit or loss and consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended_
_December 30, 2020 have been derived from the comparative column in the 2021 Audited Financial_
_Statements of the Parent and (v) consolidated statement of profit or loss, consolidated statement of_
_financial position, and consolidated statement of cash flows as of and for the period ended September_
_30, 2022 and the nine months ended September 30, 2023 have been derived from the Unaudited Interim_
_Financial Statements of AGHL which have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 and are included_
_elsewhere in this offering memorandum._

_In addition, in September 2023, we announced the Retail Transaction. As a result of this merger and_
_the resulting disposal of the Retail platform, in our Unaudited Interim Financial, we have presented_
_Retail as held for sale on our consolidated statement of financial position as of September 30, 2023 and_
_as a discontinued operation on our consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive_
_income for the nine months period ended September 30, 2023 and the period ended September 30, 2022._
_We have not restated or represented any other financial information as of or for any other period for_
_the impact of the Retail Transaction. See “Summary—Recent Developments—Retail Transaction” and_

**Overview**

We are a highly diversified, leading independent insurance broker based in the United Kingdom
(“UK”) operating at scale across numerous segments of the non-life insurance market in the UK and
internationally. We provide a full range of non-life insurance products and related services across
commercial, personal and wholesale insurance. As an insurance distribution intermediary, our business
primarily consists of working with insurers to design, price, and administer insurance-related products
and services, and as such, we do not assume any underwriting or principal risk. From our formation in
2017 to the end of 2023, we have increased our revenue (excluding Retail) by over three times and our
Adjusted EBITDA (excluding Retail) by over five times, due to consistent strong organic growth and
our proven acquisition strategy. The foundations laid over the past five years have provided a platform
for further growth, which has positioned us, pro forma for all material acquisitions and disposals
completed or committed as of November 2, 2023, as a top 10 independent insurance broker and a top
20 insurance broker globally according to Reinsurance News. In September 2023, we announced the
merger and sale of our Retail Business to Markerstudy in a transaction valuing the business at £1.2
billion. See “Summary—Recent Developments—Retail Transaction.” For the twelve months ended
September 30, 2023 and excluding Retail, we generated GWP of £12 billion, commissions and fees of
£1.2 billion, Total Pro Forma Income of £1.6 billion, organic growth of 11.6%, Total Pro Forma
Adjusted EBITDA of £555.8 million and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA margin of 33%.

We offer a broad range of non-life insurance products in multiple geographies, ranging from higher
value and lower volume bespoke corporate insurance products placed in the London Market, to SMB
business insurance policies. Each aspect of our business is highly diversified with limited concentration
or dependence on any single product, channel, carrier, income producer, or supplier. We combine this
diversified operating model with a highly collaborative culture across the Group to provide our clients,
carriers, and employees with a high-quality product and service offering. We serve a wide range of
clients that include large MNCs, SMEs, individual consumers, and other third-party brokers and MGAs.

We distribute our insurance products across multiple channels, including through a network of over 120
local offices in the United Kingdom and more than 150 offices worldwide, and online. Our global
network provides the basis for deep, embedded local relationships and “trusted advisor” status with
clients and benefits from long-standing trusted insurer partner relationships. We also maintain regional
hubs to support our businesses through shared resources and expertise.

**Significant Factors Affecting Results of Operations**

Our business and results of operations have been affected by certain key factors in the past and we
expect these key factors to affect our business in the future. Each of these additional factors is discussed
in more detail below.

96


-----

**_Acquisitions and Disposals_**

We have a long-term track record and well-established process for identifying, executing, and
integrating highly accretive acquisitions across many geographies. We have completed or entered into
acquisition agreements for more than 150 acquisitions since our establishment in 2017, which represents
an enterprise value of over £3.2 billion with a year-to-date average “add-on” enterprise value multiple
of 6.6 times and a “platform” enterprise value multiple of 9.6 times. Acquisitions completed during the
fourth quarter of 2023 (including the impact of the AccuRisk disposal) contributed Pro Forma Adjusted
EBITDA of £13.6 million for the twelve months ended September 30, 2023. We also have further 36
acquisitions that are contractually committed or under signed letter of intent as of February 1, 2024,
which would contribute an additional £32.2 million of Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA. Our pipeline
includes targets on multiple continents. We intend to continue to pursue further strategic and financially
accretive acquisitions of businesses, assets or insurance books when opportunities exist and fit with our
corporate culture and overall strategy.

Our major acquisitions since mid-2020 include, among others:

- Arachas, a commercial insurance broker in Ireland in 2020;

- Bravo, which comprises Broker Network and Compass, two established network service
providers to regional insurance brokers and Ethos Broking, a highly active acquisition platform
focused on the UK regional insurance market, in 2020;

- Resilium Pty Limited, the founding business of our Australian platform, in February 2021;

- Hemsley Wynne Furlong LLP, a specialist M&A warranty and indemnity insurance broker and
advisor, in March 2021;

- Usay Group Limited, one of the largest consumer personal medical insurance and protection
insurance brokers in the UK, in September 2021;

- the Hooper Dolan companies, a client-focused general insurance broker with offices across
Ireland, in October 2021;

- the insurance operations of BGC Partners Inc., a leading global brokerage and financial
technology company, in November 2021;

- the Léons Group, a family-owned independent insurance brokerage and consultancy firm based
in the Netherlands, in October 2022;

- Glennon Insurances, a leading provider of insurance solutions in Ireland, in December 2022;

- the MDS Group, an insurance broker and risk management advisor primarily based in Portugal
and Brazil, with offices in Angola, Mozambique, Spain, Switzerland and Malta, in December
2022;

- Envest PTY Limited, an Australian insurance investment and distribution group, in February
2023;

- the Oxford Insurance Group, a Lloyd’s broker with further operations in Switzerland,
Liechtenstein and Dubai, in March 2023;

- the SRS Group, an Athens-based group whose businesses include an independent wholesale
reinsurance broker and a managing general agencies (“MGA”) platform, in June 2023;

97


-----

- Klap Verzekeringsmakelaar, a Dutch specialist commercial lines insurance broker, in June
2023;

- Classicus, a high-net-worth broker headquartered in the Netherlands, in August 2023; and

- ASSEPRO, one of the largest independent commercial brokers for small and medium-sized
enterprises in Switzerland, with additional operations in Austria and Liechtenstein, in
November 2023.

We also enter into disposals and other similar transactions from time to time. In September 2023, we
announced the merger and disposal of the Retail platform with the Markerstudy Group, with our
shareholders maintaining a minority stake in the Merged Business. The transaction values Atlanta at
£1.2 billion. The Retail Transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals.
As a result of this merger and the resulting disposal of the Retail platform, we have presented Retail as
held for sale on our consolidated statement of financial position as of September 30, 2023 and as a
discontinued operation on our consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income
for the nine months period ended September 30, 2023 and the period ended September 30, 2022. See
“Summary—Recent Developments—Retail Transaction.” In addition, on October 30, 2023, we agreed
to sell the subsidiaries of Alpha Investment Holdings Limited, including the AccuRisk Solutions LLC
group of entities, to Ryan Specialty. This transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and
regulatory approval.

The results of each of these acquisitions and disposals are included or excluded, as applicable, in the
Financial Statements from the date the relevant transaction was completed. See “—Significant Factors
_Affecting Comparability Between Periods—Historic Acquisitions and Disposals” and note 11 to the_
Unaudited Interim Financial Statements.

As a general matter, following an acquisition of a business or group of assets, our results of operations
are impacted by the results of the newly acquired business or operations, the purchase accounting for
the acquisition, any debt incurred to acquire the business or operations and expenditures made to
integrate the newly acquired business or operations. See also “—Business Transformation and
_Synergies” below. We incur certain costs and expenses in connection with any potential or completed_
acquisition. We have adjusted for certain acquisition-related costs in our Adjusted EBITDA. See
“Summary—Summary Historical Financial Information and Other Data—Other Consolidated
_Financial and Pro Forma Data.”_

**_Insurance Cycle_**

The general insurance cycle is an insurance market phenomenon that is driven by supply of and demand
for insurance and can be particularly pronounced in reinsurance and industrial lines insurance. The
insurance market cycle is defined as “softening” and “hardening.” “Soft” periods are characterized by
falling or stagnant premium rates and are driven normally by excessive supply of capital from insurance
companies and other market participants competing for available business. Soft markets on average
result in low profitability for the insurers and as a result lower commissions for brokers. “Hard” periods
can be precipitated by catastrophes, such as natural disasters, or similar significant losses, for example,
severe credit market losses, that result in insurers’ capital becoming depleted or some insurers no longer
being able to participate in the market. The lack of capital and decreased competition drives up premium
rates, thereby the potential for greater profitability for the remaining insurers. Additionally, catastrophes
or similar significant losses may also precipitate increased customer demand for insurance policies,
driving demand for capital and further hardening the market.

**_Commission and Fees_**

As an insurance intermediary, we derive our revenue primarily from commission and fees. Our
commission income is generally based on insurance premiums and negotiated commission rates, and

98


-----

fees are paid for claims administration or other individual services based on negotiated amounts. We
derive a small portion of our commission income from profit commission agreements with our insurers.
Profit commissions are typically dependent upon the underwriting profitability of the business placed
with the insurer, which is a function of premiums earned less commission paid, claims costs, insurer
expenses and the target financial returns for the insurer. We are less able to forecast profit commissions
than premium based commissions due to the link with variable insurance events and the inherent
volatility this brings. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry— _Volatility or_
_declines in premiums, declines in commission rates or increases in applicable premium taxes may_
_seriously undermine our business and results of operations.” Furthermore, catastrophic events, whether_
natural or otherwise, can have a significant effect on the number and value of claims being made, and
therefore a significant effect on the profitability of the business we place with the insurance company.
Changes in profit commissions are largely attributable to economic and market conditions that are
outside of our control and that affect premium prices and lead to increases or decreases in overall claims.

We also offer customers access to premium finance providers for a fee. A premium finance provider
covers the upfront costs of insurance premiums and bills the individual or company in installments to
recover the insurance premium cost.

**_Business Expansion and Transformational Hires_**

We have invested significantly, and continue to invest, in recruiting talent to the insurance broking and
health insurance businesses within our Global P&C platform. In our Specialty Broking platform, we
focus on retaining and attracting income producers and optimizing our panel of products and capacity
providers. Part of our strategy is to drive our existing hires to maturity and hire exceptional individuals
who can swiftly add value to our Group. We added Adjusted EBITDA of approximately £30 million
for the twelve months ended September 30, 2023 from 29 new producer teams hired since 2020. Organic
growth has accelerated since 2021 in part by the maturing income profile of new hires in prior periods.
Our investments in new hires often result in losses in the early years while they build up our client base.
Costs associated with transformational hires include recruitment costs, sign-on bonuses, cost of
retention, and salary costs while hires are under restrictive non-compete covenants or are impacted by
insurer capacity restrictions. Teams typically mature to their full profitability potential approximately
three years after the expiry of capacity or covenant restrictions. Seven teams hired in 2020 were at 75%
maturity as of September 30, 2023, seven teams hired in 2021 were at 58% maturity as of September
30, 2023 and seven teams hired in 2022 were at 37% maturity as of September 30, 2023. In addition,
we hired six teams that started trading in 2023. As a result, we expect to realize additional Adjusted
EBITDA as a result of these hires over the next three years.

We have also focused on expansion into new geographies and into new products and niches. Since
2020, we have expanded our addressable markets in new synergistic geographies through acquisitions
such as the MDS Group in Brazil, Klap Verzekeringsmakelaar and the Léons Group in the Netherlands
and ASSEPRO in Switzerland and Austria. In addition, in 2021, we launched Inver Re, a new
reinsurance broker with ambitions to harness our scale, resources and reach to offer a credible
alternative to global brokers and become our industry’s independent reinsurance broker of choice.

**_Business Transformation and Synergies_**

We have a strong track record of delivering cost down plans and synergies. Since our establishment,
we have delivered a transformational improvement in quality of earnings, primarily as a result of
significant investments towards transformative cost-savings programs and synergy initiatives in our
business to create a scalable and efficient platform that is conducive to future growth, resulting in
approximately £150 million of realized cost-savings since the start of 2018 and approximately £110
million since the start of 2020. We have also identified approximately £15.8 million of near-term cost
savings that we expect can be delivered within the next 12 months, which are described in the table
below:

**_Regulatory Compliance and Costs_**

Our businesses are authorized and regulated by the FCA and firms in our industry must maintain
regulatory authorization. Our insurance intermediary activities must comply with FCA rules and
guidelines that impose, among other things, a high-level standard on the establishment and maintenance
of proper systems and controls and minimum threshold conditions that must be satisfied for an insurance
broking firm to remain authorized as well as rules on the conduct of business and treating customers
fairly (the “FCA Rules”). The FCA Rules impose minimum “threshold conditions” that must be
satisfied as well as robust standards for the establishment and maintenance of proper systems and
controls, notably for the conduct of business and the fair treatment of customers. We incur costs to
comply with the changing regulatory landscape. The FCA Rules also impose upon us certain minimum
capital and liquidity requirements. See “Risk Factors—Risk Factors Related to Our Business and
_Industry—If we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or guidelines, we may not be able to_

100


-----

_conduct business or may be subject to sanctions or substantial fines that may have a material adverse_
_effect on our reputation, results of operations and financial condition.”_

**_Currency Fluctuations and Hedging_**

While the majority of our business is conducted in the United Kingdom, we have an increasing number
of global operations, which exposes us to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. A significant amount
of our income from our Specialty Broking and Global P&C: International Advisory specialty is
denominated in U.S. dollars and euros, although Specialty segment costs are incurred substantially in
pound sterling. We enter into forward contracts to mitigate the exposure resulting from USD revenue
arising on the placement of certain premiums denominated in USD. If we are unable to hedge our
foreign currency revenues or otherwise match brokerage and fees received in foreign currencies with
costs paid in the same currency, results of operations may be affected by currency exchange rate
fluctuations. As a result of the Transactions, we expect to have a significantly improved natural hedging
profile, as the proportionate mix of currencies within the anticipated capital structure (Australian dollar,
euro and U.S. dollar) much more closely match the currencies in which operational cash flow is
generated.

Furthermore, as we present our consolidated financial statements in pound sterling, we are required to
translate the assets, liabilities, income and expenses of all operations that use a functional currency other
than pound sterling, such as U.S. dollars. We translate into pound sterling at then-applicable exchange
rates, exposing us to translation risk (i.e., the risk that exchange rates will impact the value of our
income, assets, liabilities and expenses reported in pound sterling even if the value has not changed in
U.S. dollars) should the pound sterling strengthen against the U.S. dollar. Furthermore, our international
expansion strategy exposes us to additional translation risk. Currency translations could significantly
affect the comparability of our results between financial periods and could result in significant changes
to the carrying value of assets, liabilities and shareholders’ equity.

**_Seasonality_**

We experience some seasonality in the volumes of insurance policies we place and, consequently, in
our commission and fees. Like many of our competitors, we have historically transacted less business
from November to February than in other months. Accordingly, commission and fees for the first and
fourth quarter tend to be slightly lower than the second and third quarter. In addition, our use of cash is
seasonal. For example, we pay certain bonuses to employees (in March of each year) and certain
amounts to tax authorities (in April of each year), resulting in higher cash uses during such periods. In
addition, we currently have two payment dates for our main debt interest payments in January 2024 and
July 2024.

A portion of the Retail platform is characterized by highly seasonal revenue as a consequence of
traditional policy renewal patterns across the various lines of business. For example, our Carole Nash
business experiences seasonality resulting from fewer motorbikes being sold during the winter months
and as a consequence fewer motorbike insurance policies are placed during the same period. Following
the completion of the Retail Transaction, we expect to reduce some of the impact of seasonality on our
business.

**Significant Factors Affecting Comparability Between Periods**

**_Historic Acquisitions and Disposals_**

We have a long-term track record and well-established process for identifying, executing, and
integrating highly accretive acquisitions across many geographies. We have completed or entered into
acquisition agreements for more than 150 acquisitions since our establishment in 2017. We have also
completed two disposals during the periods under review, and have entered into agreements for a further
two disposals. We also completed 25 acquisitions in 2022, and have completed or executed share

101


-----

purchase agreements or letters of intent for 73 acquisitions since January 1, 2023. See “—Significant
_Factors Affecting Results of Operations—Acquisitions and Disposals” for a description of the_
acquisitions and disposals completed during the periods under review. We intend to continue to pursue
further strategic and financially accretive acquisitions of businesses, assets or insurance books when
and where opportunities exist and fit with our corporate culture and overall strategy. As a result, our
financial statements may not be fully comparable from period to period.

As a general matter, following an acquisition of a business or group of assets, our results of operations
are impacted by the results of the newly acquired business or operations, the purchase accounting for
the acquisition, any debt incurred to acquire the business or operations and expenditures made to
integrate the newly acquired business or operations which also affects the comparability of our results
with the previous period. In addition to increasing our income through increasing our commission and
fees, we incur certain costs and expenses in connection with any potential or completed acquisition. See
also “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—Our selective acquisition and
_disposal strategy exposes us to risks, including the risk that we may not be able to successfully integrate_
_acquired businesses or that acquisitions may have liabilities that we are not aware of and may not be_
_as profitable as we may have expected them to be and that disposals may not have the impact on results_
_of operations that we expected them to have.”_

_The Retail Transaction_

In September 2023, we announced the merger and disposal of the Retail platform with the Markerstudy
Group, with our shareholders maintaining a stake in the combined business. The transaction values
Atlanta at £1.2 billion. The Retail Transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory
approvals. As a result of this merger and the resulting disposal of the Retail platform, in our Unaudited
Interim Financial Statements we have presented Retail as held for sale on our consolidated statement of
financial position as of September 30, 2023 and as a discontinued operation on our consolidated
statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income for the nine months period ended September
30, 2023 and the period ended September 30, 2022. See “Summary—Recent Developments—Retail
_Transaction.”_

**_Financing_**

_Debt transactions_

Our future results of operations, and in particular our interest expense, may be affected as a result of the
refinancing of our Existing Notes and Existing Senior Secured Credit Facilities in connection with the
Transactions. The Notes and the New Term Facilities, and potentially amounts drawn under our
Revolving Credit Facility and CAR Facility, will be denominated in currencies other than pounds
sterling. This will also affect our financial results to the extent these currencies fluctuate against the
pound sterling. However, as a result of the Transactions, we expect to have a significantly improved
natural hedging profile, as the proportionate mix of currencies within the anticipated capital structure
much more closely match the currencies in which operational cash flow is generated. The servicing of
our indebtedness will impact, among other things, our cash flows and our cash balances. In addition, as
the New Term Facilities will bear interest at a floating rate, we will continue to face interest rates risk
going forward. See “Risks Factors—Risks Related to Our Financial Profile— _The New Senior Secured_
_Credit Facilities will bear interest at floating rates that could rise significantly, increasing our interest_
_cost and reducing cash flow.” While we currently do not envisage entering into any transactions to_
hedge any potential exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates in respect of the Transaction, we
expect to enter into interest rate hedging arrangements and will have the option to enter into foreign
exchange derivative transactions under the terms of the Indenture.

102


-----

_Equity transactions_

In December 2021, we announced a significant new equity investment whereby our two anchor
investors, Madison Dearborn Partners and HPS Investment Partners, agreed to invest capital through
new funds as part of the equity investment of over $1 billion. These investments, made through certain
co-investments by large global institutions through accounts managed by Madison Dearborn Partners
and HPS Investment Partners, increased our Sponsor’s shareholdings and funded minority buy-outs.
Following completion of the Tara Transactions, the corporate structure of the Group changed. On May
31, 2022, The Ardonagh Group Limited, the entity at which we previously reported our results, merged
into the Group’s new indirect parent company, Tara Topco Limited. Following this merger, on June 1,
2022, AGHL acquired Ardonagh New Midco 3 Limited, including the Group companies that were
previously owned by The Ardonagh Group Limited, and became the reporting entity for the Group.
AGHL’s first reporting period included all transactions since its incorporation on December 8, 2021 to
December 31, 2022. The period ended September 30, 2022, however, only includes four months of the
results of operations and cash flows of the consolidated operations of AGHL due to the timing of the
Tara Transactions. Accordingly, AGHL’s results during any period ended in 2022 are not comparable
to any other period presented. See “Presentation of Financial Information.”

**_Reporting segments_**

Under IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’, we determine operating segments based on the information that
is provided to the Group Executive Committee, which is the Group’s chief operating decision maker,
and it aggregates its operating segments into reporting segments where aggregation provides useful
information to the users of the financial statements and where the operating segments have similar
characteristics. Reporting segments are reviewed and revised as necessary following structural changes
within the Group or acquisitions of new companies.

Since June 22, 2017, we have redefined our operating segments a number of times in accordance with
the needs of the expanding business and the new acquisitions. The periodic re-organization of our
reporting segments reflects our ongoing business at the relevant time and impacts the comparability of
segmental financial information as the underlying inputs will be reallocated based on the revised
segmentation. Under “—Results of Operations” below, we refer to our segments by different names
than in the Financial Statements. The segments have not been restated or changed. We refer to (i)
Ardonagh Advisory as Global P&C: UK Advisory, (i) Ardonagh International as Global P&C:
International Advisory, (iii) Ardonagh Specialty as Specialty Broking and (iv) Ardonagh Retail as
Retail.

_____________

(1) On May 31, 2022, The Ardonagh Group Limited, the entity at which we previously reported our results, merged into the Group’s
new indirect parent company, Tara Topco Limited. Following this merger, on June 1, 2022, AGHL acquired Ardonagh New Midco
3 Limited, including the Group companies that were previously owned by The Ardonagh Group Limited, and became the reporting
entity for the Group. AGHL’s first reporting period included all transactions since its incorporation on December 8, 2021 to
December 31, 2022, but only includes four months of the results of operations and cash flows of the consolidated operations of
AGHL due to the timing of the Tara Transactions. In order to present meaningfully comparable financial information, we present
the financial information of (i) the Company for the years ended 2020, 2021 and 2022 and (ii) AGHL for the nine months ended
September 30, 2023 and the twelve months ended September 30, 2023 in this table. See “Presentation of Financial Information”
and note 1 to the Unaudited Interim Financial Statements.

(2) The consolidated statement of profit and loss of AGHL for the period ended September 30, 2022 includes all transactions from the
incorporation of AGHL on December 8, 2021 to September 30, 2022, but only includes four months of the results of operations of
the consolidated operations of AGHL due to the timing of the Tara Transactions. As a result, the comparability between the
consolidated statement of profit and loss of AGHL for the period ended September 30, 2022 and the nine months ended 2023 is
limited. See “Presentation of Financial Information” and notes 1 and 26 to the Unaudited Interim Financial Statements.

(3) As a result of the Retail Transaction, Retail is presented as a discontinued operation in the consolidated statement of loss and other
comprehensive income in the financial information of AGHL for the period ended September 30, 2022 and the nine months ended
September 30, 2023, and therefore excluded from the results presented in the above table. See “Presentation of Financial
_Information” and note 26 to the Unaudited Interim Financial Statements._

(4) In the 2022 Audited Financial Statements, the Parent changed the presentation of investment income and it is now presented as
part of finance income. This change in presentation was reflected also in the comparative period. As such, the line items investment
income, operating profit and finance income for the year ended 31 December 2021 included in this offering memorandum and
derived from the 2021 Audited Financial Statements differ from the same line items in the 2021 comparative column in the 2022
Audited Financial Statements. The information for the year ended December 31, 2020 also does not reflect this change in
presentation

(5) Total income as presented above comprises the sum of commission and fees, other income, investment income and finance income.

(6) See “Summary Historical Financial Information and Other Data—Other Consolidated Financial and Pro Forma Data” for
reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to Loss for the Period. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-IFRS measure. See “Presentation of
_Financial Information—Non-IFRS Measures.”_

**Results of Operations—Ardonagh Group Holdings Limited—Nine Months Ended September 30,**
**2023 Compared to the Period Ended September 30, 2022**

**_Total Income_**

Total income from continuing operations increased by 190.9%, or £619.4 million, to £943.9 million for
the nine months ended September 30, 2023 from £324.5 million for period ended September 30, 2022.
This increase was primarily due to the Tara Transactions as the results for the period ended September
30, 2022 only included transactions from June 1, 2022 to September 30, 2022 whereas the results for
the nine months ended September 30, 2023 include transactions for the entire period. Other than as
related to the Tara Transactions, this increase was primarily due to acquisitions completed during the
nine months ended September 30, 2023 and due to organic growth of 11.6% (excluding Retail) in the
twelve months ended September 30, 2023, which occurred across all platforms but primarily in
Specialty Broking and International Advisory.

**_Salaries and associated costs_**

Salaries and associated costs from continuing operations increased by 172.9%, or £296.9 million, to
£468.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 from £171.8 million for the period ended
September 30, 2022. This increase was primarily due to the Tara Transactions. As a percentage of Total
Income, salaries and associated costs from continuing operations decreased from 52.9% for the period

105


-----

ended September 30, 2022 to 49.7% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The relative
decrease of salaries and associated costs from continuing operations was primarily due to our revenue
growth increasing faster than our salary growth in our faster growing markets.

**_Other operating costs_**

Other operating costs from continuing operations increased by 263.7%, or £179.7 million, to £247.9
million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 from £68.1 million for the period ended
September 30, 2022. This increase was primarily due to the Tara Transactions. As a percentage of Total
Income, other operating costs from continuing operations increased from 21.0% for the period ended
September 30, 2022 to 26.3% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was
primarily due to higher acquisition and financing costs as we increased our acquisition activity in 2023.

**_Depreciation, amortisation and impairment of non-financial assets_**

Depreciation, amortisation and impairment of non-financial assets increased by 107.8%, or £72.2
million, to £139.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 from £67.0 million for the
period ended September 30, 2022. This increase was primarily due to the Tara Transactions.

**_Finance costs_**

Finance costs from continuing operations increased by 61.7%, or £135.4 million, to £355.0 million for
the nine months ended September 30, 2023 from £219.5 million for the period ended September 30,
2022. This increase was primarily due to the Tara Transactions. Excluding the impact of the Tara
Transactions, the Group’s finance costs decreased as a result of favorable foreign exchange on
borrowings movements.

**_Tax credit_**

Tax credit from continuing operations decreased by 17.8%, or £5.5 million, to £25.3 million for the
nine months ended September 30, 2023 from £30.7 million for the period ended September 30, 2022.
This decrease was due to the Tara Transactions and a change in the applicable effective tax rate of
15.3% in 2022 as compared to an effective tax rate of 9.9% in 2023.

**_Loss for the period_**

Loss for the period from continuing operations increased by 35.5%, or £60.4 million, to £230.2 million
for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 from £169.8 million for the period ended September 30,
2022. This increase was primarily due to the Tara Transactions. Excluding the impact of the Tara
Transactions, loss for the period decreased primarily due to a decrease in finance costs, an increase in
finance income, gains on the revaluation of joint venture and the profit on disposal of business, partially
offset by a decrease in operating profit due to inflation and an increase in tax charges.

**_Adjusted EBITDA_**

Adjusted EBITDA increased by 203.5%, or £204.6 million, to £305.1 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2023 from £100.5 million for the period ended September 30, 2022. This increase was
primarily due to the Tara Transactions. Excluding the impact of the Tara Transactions, the increase in
Adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to a combination of acquisitions and organic growth, seen across
all platforms but primarily in the Specialty Broking, UK Advisory and International Advisory
platforms, with income growth and the delivery of cost savings and synergies offsetting the pressures
of inflation.

**Results of Operations—Ardonagh Midco 2 plc—Year Ended December 31, 2022 Compared to**
**the Year Ended December 31, 2021**

**_Total Income_**

Total income increased by 30.3%, or £286.2 million, to £1,232.0 million in the year ended December
31, 2022 from £945.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase was primarily due to
increased commission and fees driven by acquisitions completed in the year ended December 31, 2022
and as a result of organic growth driven by the International Advisory, Specialty Broking and UK
Advisory platforms.

**_Salaries and associated costs_**

Salaries and associated costs increased by 34.4%, or £153.6 million, to £600.3 million in the year ended
December 31, 2022 from £446.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase was
primarily due to an increase in the number of employees in 2022. As a percentage of Total Income,
salaries and associated costs from continuing operations increase from 47.2% for the year ended
December 31, 2021 to 48.7% for the year ended December 31, 2022. The slight increase of salaries and
associated costs from continuing operations was primarily due to the increase of the Specialty Broking
segment, where employees have higher salaries and associated costs as a share of income, as a share of
the total Ardonagh business.

**_Other operating costs_**

Other operating costs increased by 33.7%, or £89.2 million, to £354.1 million in the year ended
December 31, 2022 from £264.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase was

110


-----

primarily due to growth through acquisitions and underlying cost inflation. As a percentage of Total
Income, other operating costs from continuing operations increased from 28.0% for the year ended
December 31, 2021 to 28.7% for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily due
to underlying inflation in other costs outstripping revenue growth.

**_Depreciation, amortisation and impairment of non-financial assets_**

Depreciation, amortisation and impairment of non-financial assets increased by 49.6%, or £58.3
million, to £175.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2022 from £117.4 million in the year ended
December 31, 2021. This increase was primarily due to growth through acquisitions and investments in
technology assets across the Group.

**_Finance costs_**

Finance costs increased by 106.0%, or £216.8 million, to £421.3 million in the year ended December
31, 2022 from £204.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase was primarily due to
foreign exchange fluctuations resulting in additional expense on the revaluation of the borrowings,
increased borrowings, and increases in base interest rates resulting in additional interest expense.

**_Tax credit_**

Tax credit increased by 99.5%, or £22.4 million, to £44.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2022
from £22.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase was primarily due to larger loss
before taxation on continuing operations.

**_Loss for the period_**

Loss for the period increased by 290.6%, or £208.9 million, to £280.8 million in the year ended
December 31, 2022 from £71.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase was
primarily due to an increase of £216.8 million in finance costs, an increase of £13.5 million in business
transformation costs and changes in foreign exchange gains, and a decrease in operating profit partially
offset by an increase in financial income and an increase in tax credit.

**_Adjusted EBITDA_**

Adjusted EBITDA increased by 16.6%, or £53.1 million, to £373.4 million in the year ended December
31, 2022 from £320.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase was primarily due to
a combination of acquisitions and organic growth in all platforms except for Retail, with income growth
and the delivery of cost savings and synergies offsetting the pressures of inflation.

strong organic growth and growth through acquisitions. Profit before tax decreased by 78.1%, or £40.5
million, to £11.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2022 from £51.9 million for the year ended
December 31, 2021. This decrease was primarily due to increased finance and other operating costs
including acquisition costs, as the segment increased its acquisition activity.

2021 from £713.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due strong
organic revenue growth in our Global P&C and Specialty Broking platforms, partially offset by a small
decline in Retail resulting from market volatility towards the end of 2021.

-----

**_Salaries and associated costs_**

Salaries and associated costs increased by 29.3%, or £101.2 million, to £446.7 million in the year ended
December 31, 2021 from £345.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was
primarily due to an increase in the number of employees in 2021. As a percentage of Total Income,
salaries and associated costs from continuing operations decreased from 48.4% for the year ended
December 31, 2020 to 47.2% for the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease of salaries and
associated costs from continuing operations was primarily due to the impact of various business
transformation programs.

**_Other operating costs_**

Other operating costs increased by 28.3%, or £58.5 million, to £264.9 million in the year ended
December 31, 2021 from £206.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was
primarily due an increase in the number of acquisitions completed in 2021. As a percentage of Total
Income, other operating costs from continuing operations decreased from 28.9% for the year ended
December 31, 2020 to 28.0% for the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease was primarily due
to the impact of various business transformation programs.

**_Depreciation, amortisation and impairment of non-financial assets_**

Depreciation, amortisation and impairment of non-financial assets increased by 22.1%, or £21.3
million, to £117.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 from £96.2 million in the year ended
December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to the increase in the number of acquisitions
completed from mid-2020 through 2021 (notably the acquisition of Bravo and the acquisition of
Arachas).

**_Finance costs_**

Finance costs decreased by 13.3%, or £31.3 million, to £204.5 million in the year ended December 31,
2021 from £235.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease was primarily due to an
amendment to the terms of the Existing Term Facilities on August 19, 2021. Pursuant to the amendment,
the margin on the Existing Term Facilities was reduced by 0.25%, and the option to pay interest in kind
was removed. On November 18, 2021, the foregoing margins were further reduced by 0.50% due to the
change to the consolidated senior net leverage ratio.

**_Tax credit/(expense)_**

Tax credit was £22.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to a tax expense of
£17.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. The change was primarily due to the higher
corporate tax in 2020.

**_Loss for the period_**

Loss for the period decreased by 64.0%, or £127.5 million, to £71.9 million in the year ended December
31, 2021 from £199.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease was primarily due to
a reduction in financing costs as compared to the prior period due to certain one-off costs related to the
refinancing of our senior secured notes and revolving credit facility in 2020 and a decrease in tax
charges.

**_Adjusted EBITDA_**

Adjusted EBITDA increased by 41.6%, or £94.2 million, to £320.3 million in the year ended December
31, 2021 from £226.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to
strong organic growth across all platforms, with the exception of Retail where growth was flat, through

a combination of income growth in both existing and newly acquired businesses and the delivery of
significant cost savings through ongoing programs.

**Liquidity and Capital Resources**

Liquidity describes the availability of liquid resources and ability of a company to generate sufficient
cash flows to meet the cash requirements of its business operations, including working capital needs,
capital expenditure, debt service obligations, other commitments, contractual obligations and
acquisitions. Proactive and careful management of our liquidity continues to be a key priority for us,
utilizing both medium (12 months rolling) and short-term (13 weeks rolling) forecasts. Our liquidity
requirements arise primarily to meet our debt service obligations, to fund capital expenditures, to fund
salaries and other associated costs and to fund acquisitions. Going forward, our primary sources of
liquidity are provided by our cash from operating activities and drawings under the Revolving Credit
Facility. In addition, we received net proceeds for issuance of share capital from our shareholders in the
amount of £134.9 million in January 2023 and £187.4 million in March 2023.

Our debt service obligations consist primarily of interest payments on the Existing Senior Secured
Credit Facilities and the Existing Notes, and following the Transactions, including the Offering, will
consist of interest payments on the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the Notes.

Although we believe that our expected cash flows from operating activities, together with available
borrowings will be adequate to meet our anticipated general liquidity needs and debt service obligations,
we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations to meet these
needs or that future debt or equity financing will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us
to fund our liquidity needs, including making payments on the Notes or other debt when due. If our
cash flows from operating activities are lower than expected or our capital expenditure requirements
exceed our projections, we may be required to seek additional financing, which may not be available
on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Our ability to arrange financing generally and our cost of
capital depends on numerous factors, including general economic conditions, the availability of credit

(1) On May 31, 2022, The Ardonagh Group Limited, the entity at which we previously reported our results, merged into the
Group’s new indirect parent company, Tara Topco Limited. Following this merger, on June 1, 2022, AGHL acquired
Ardonagh New Midco 3 Limited, including the Group companies that were previously owned by The Ardonagh Group
Limited, and became the reporting entity for the Group. AGHL’s first reporting period included all transactions since its
incorporation on December 8, 2021 to December 31, 2022, but only includes four months of the results of operations and
cash flows of the consolidated operations of AGHL due to the timing of the Tara Transactions. In order to present
meaningfully comparable financial information, we present the financial information of (i) the Company for the years ended
2020, 2021 and 2022 and (ii) AGHL for the period ended September 30, 2022 and the nine months ended September 30,
2023 in this table. See “Presentation of Financial Information” and note 1 to the Unaudited Interim Financial Statements.

(2) The consolidated statement of cash flows of AGHL for the period ended September 30, 2022 includes all transactions from
the incorporation of AGHL on December 8, 2021 to September 30, 2022, but only includes four months of the results of
operations and cash flows of the consolidated operations of AGHL due to the timing of the Tara Transactions. As a result,
the comparability between the consolidated statement of cash flows of AGHL for the period ended September 30, 2022 and
the nine months ended 2023 is limited. See “Presentation of Financial Information” and notes 1 and 26 to the Unaudited
Interim Financial Statements.

_Net cash inflow from operating activities_

The net cash inflow from operating activities increased by £46.3 million to £278.7 million for the nine
months ended September 30, 2023 from a net cash inflow of £232.4 million for the period ended
September 30, 2022. This increase was primarily due to the Tara Transactions.

_Net cash inflow/(outflow) from investing activities_

The net cash flow from investing activities decreased by £1,543.3 million to a net cash outflow of
£471.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 from a net cash inflow of £1,072.3 million
for the period ended September 30, 2022. This increase was primarily due to the Tara Transactions as
the entire business of the Group was acquired by AGHL on June 1, 2022.

_Net cash inflow from financing activities_

The net cash inflow from financing activities increased by £435.2 million to £303.5 million for the nine
months ended September 30, 2023 from a net cash (outflow) of £131.7 million for the period ended
September 30, 2022. This increase was primarily due to the Tara Transactions.

-----

2023 and the twelve months ended September 30, 2023. See “Presentation of Financial Information” and note 1 in the
Unaudited Interim Financial Statements.

_Net cash inflow from operating activities_

The net cash inflow from operating activities decreased by £517.4 million to £171.1 million in the year
ended December 31, 2022 from a net cash inflow of £688.5 million for the year ended December 31,
2021. The decrease was predominantly due to increased losses from continuing operations and a
decrease in trade payables given that 2021 benefited from the acquisition of BGC Partners Inc.

_Net cash outflow from investing activities_

The net cash outflow from investing activities increased by £4.3 million to £426.8 million in the year
ended December 31, 2022 from a net cash outflow of £422.5 million for the year ended December 31,
2021.

_Net cash inflow from financing activities_

The net cash inflow from financing activities decreased by £350.5 million to £137.7 million in the year
ended December 31, 2022 from a net cash inflow of £488.2 million for the year ended December 31,
2021. The decrease was due to a reduction in proceeds from borrowings in 2022 in comparison to
proceeds received in 2021 in addition to an increase in interest paid on Group borrowings.

**_Group Management Presentation of Cash Flow for the nine and twelve months ended September 30,_**
**_2023_**

In our business activity as a broker, we handle significant amounts of fiduciary cash that is collected
from customers and passed on to insurers. Movements in such fiduciary cash balances are included in
the cash flow under IFRS reporting. The cash flow figures in this section represent management’s view
of cash flow excluding movements in fiduciary cash balances.

Our management operating cash flow for the twelve months ended September 30, 2023 was £420
million. Our investment spend for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was £54 million
(compared with £48 million for the same period in the prior year). Our free cash flow, for the nine
months ended September 30, 2023 was an outflow of £125 million (compared with an inflow of £3
million for the same period prior year). For the twelve months ended September 30, 2023, free cash
flow was an outflow of £40 million. Our net free cash flow for the nine months ended September 30,
2023 was an outflow of £59 million (compared with an outflow of £189 million for the same period in
the prior year). For the twelve months ended September 30, 2023, net free cash flow was an outflow of
£15 million.

**Capital Expenditures**

Ardonagh Midco 2’s capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2022 were £37.3 million,
consisting of purchases of intangible fixed assets and property, plant and equipment. For the nine
months ended September 30, 2023, AGHL’s capital expenditures were £38.6 million. We have
budgeted capital expenditures for the year ending December 31, 2024 in an amount of approximately
£26 million.

**Contingent Obligations and Liabilities**

In the ordinary course of business, we receive claims in respect of actual or alleged errors and omissions.
See “Business—Legal Proceedings.” We maintain professional indemnity insurance for such claims,
the terms of which vary by policy year. We have made a provision for claims in respect of outstanding
errors and omission claims and to self-insure against smaller claims.

**Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures About Our Market Risk**

The Group is exposed to market risk through its use of financial instruments and specifically to foreign
currency risk and interest rate risk.

**_Foreign Currency Risk_**

Our primary exposure to foreign currency risk arises from (i) our borrowings in U.S. dollars and (ii)
settlement in foreign currency, principally U.S. dollars, of brokerage and fees related to the placement
of insurance business originating outside of the United Kingdom. We use derivatives, specifically
forward contracts to mitigate this risk.

We have forward contracts that mitigate our exposure to certain U.S. dollar-denominated revenue
arising on the placement of premiums, which is not the presentation nor the functional currency of the
Group. Based on forecast transactions, we effectively sell U.S. dollar-denominated revenue by reference
to individual brokerage transactions.

**_Interest Rate Risk_**

Our main exposure to interest rate risk arises from our floating rate Existing Secured Credit Facilities,
and following the Transactions, the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. These loans bear interest at an
applicable margin plus EURIBOR or SONIA. We use derivatives, specifically interest rate swaps, to
mitigate our interest rate risk. We expect to continue to be exposed to interest rate risk following the
Transactions. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Financial Profile—The New Senior Secured
_Credit Facilities will bear interest at floating rates that could rise significantly, increasing our interest_
_cost and reducing cash flow.”_

**Significant Accounting Policies**

Significant accounting policies are those that (i) are relevant to the presentation of our financial
condition and results of operations and (ii) require management to make judgments, estimates and
assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities, income and expenses. In order to provide an understanding of how we form our judgments,
including the variables underlying their estimates and assumptions and the sensitivity of those
judgments to different circumstances, we have identified the significant accounting polices discussed
below. While we believe that all aspects of our financial statements should be studied and understood
in assessing our current and expected financial condition and results of operations, we believe the
following significant accounting policies warrant particular attention.

**_Critical judgments in applying accounting policies_**

Certain judgments that have been made in applying accounting policies are considered to be critical.

_Acquisitions and Disposals_

AGHL obtained control of Ardonagh New Midco 3 Limited on June 1, 2022. For the year ended
December 31, 2022, AGHL applied acquisition accounting in accordance with IFRS 3 Business
Combinations to the acquisition of Ardonagh New Midco 3 Limited at fair value on June 1, 2022, which
included the recognition of intangible assets arising on a business combination and the recognition of
goodwill and non-controlling interests. A critical judgment was applied in the prior year to determine
if it was appropriate to apply acquisition accounting, which included consideration of the wider
transaction, if there had been a change of control, and who was the acquirer. Acquisition accounting
was applied as a business had been acquired and because AGHL clearly obtained control of that
business. As at December 31, 2022, we had not completed the acquisition accounting of Ardonagh New
Midco 3 Limited. Goodwill recognized in the prior year’s consolidated financial statements was based

119


-----

on provisional fair values of the assets acquired. The initial allocation of goodwill to the cash generating
units was also done on a provisional basis in accordance with IAS 36. During 2023, AGHL and its
subsidiaries completed the acquisition accounting of Ardonagh New Midco 3 Limited, and the resulting
amount of goodwill has been finalized and reallocated to cash-generating units in a manner that is most
appropriate to the business.

During 2023, AGHL and its subsidiaries entered into negotiations to dispose of the entire share capital
of Atlanta Investment Holdings 3 Limited, being the holding company for the Retail operating segment.
On September 1, 2023, all material matters fundamental to the deal were agreed upon with the buyer
and there were no further matters that could have caused the planned sale to be withdrawn or changed
significantly. Consequently, as at that date the disposal group was classified as held for sale in
accordance with IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations. At that date,
the carrying values of all assets and liabilities within the disposal group were measured in accordance
with applicable IFRS and then compared to the fair value less cost to sell of the disposal group. The
excess, if any, of the carrying value of the disposal group over its fair value less cost to sell is required
to be recognized as an impairment loss. There was no material difference between the carrying value
and the fair value less cost to sell of the disposal group and therefore no impairment loss was recognized.
Furthermore, in accordance with IFRS 5, from the date of classification as held for sale, non-current
assets within the disposal group are not subject to depreciation or amortisation.

**_Key sources of estimation uncertainty_**

_Impairment of assets_

We test annually whether goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives have suffered
any impairment. Other assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may exceed their recoverable amounts. The last annual
impairment test was performed as of July 1, 2023.

An impairment test of an asset or cash-generating unit (or group of cash-generating units) is performed
by comparing its carrying amount with its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher
of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use, where its value in use is the present value of
its future cash flows. An impairment test requires the application of significant judgment because it
relies on key assumptions, including forecast cash flows, a discount rate, a terminal growth rate and an
Adjusted EBITDA multiple. Accordingly, the resulting estimates are significant estimates because there
is a significant risk of a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of affected balances within the
next financial year.

Goodwill arising from a new business combination is, for the purposes of impairment testing, allocated
to those cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the goodwill that was acquired.
Impairment testing is performed at the level of the smallest groups of cash-generating units at which
goodwill is monitored, known as the divisions. Forecast cash flows used in the value in use calculation
were determined by considering historic business performance, by overlaying it with assumptions to
reflect areas where growth or income improvement was expected, and by taking into account the
expected results of cost management programs to which we are committed. The forecasts were
extrapolated to subsequent years using a steady growth rate being the forecast CPI inflation rate of 2%,
and a terminal value was calculated using the perpetual growth model. The discount rate of 9.55% to
11.45% that was applied to the forecasts was a market participant weighted average cost of capital
calculated by reference to the Capital Asset Pricing Model.

The fair value of AGHL and its subsidiaries was calculated based on multiples of forecast 2024
Adjusted EBITDA and on information provided by external advisors, where that information is based
on recent transactions in the insurance broking industry. The fair value of an operating segment was
estimated by apportioning the fair value of our group between the operating segments based on the

120


-----

value in use of each operating segment. The estimated costs of disposal are assumed, based on market
experience, to be 1.5% of the fair value of the operating segment. As of September 30, 2023, there were
no indications of impairment and therefore no impairment test has been performed.

**INDUSTRY OVERVIEW**

**Overview**

Providing insurance coverage to customers entails a series of activities, including (i) providing risk
capital, a service exclusively provided by insurance and reinsurance companies; (ii) underwriting
insurance policies, a service that requires in-depth technical knowledge; and (iii) distribution, a service
that requires knowledge of the customer base and of the risks to the customer. The amount of financial
risk an insurance or a reinsurance company is willing to assume in relation to its insurance policies is a
function of underwriting appetite and capital or capacity. The participants in the intermediation of
insurance products are principally brokers, underwriting agencies and aggregators as well as insurers
selling directly to customers. The chart below shows the participants across the insurance distribution
chain.

**Insurance products**

Insurance products, both specialist and non-specialist, can be broadly classified into three types: (A)
General non-life personal lines insurance; (B) General non-life commercial lines insurance, which
includes SME commercial lines insurance; and (C) Life, pensions and other financial services
insurance.

**_General non-life personal lines insurance_**

General non-life personal lines insurance is sold to individual customers and includes accident and
sickness coverage, household insurance, motor insurance, along with travel and personal accident
insurance. In these segments, specialist non-life personal lines insurance products are sold to individual
customers in niche areas within a segment or those with non-standard risk profiles, such as classic car
insurance or insurance for learner drivers.

**_General non-life commercial lines insurance_**

General non-life commercial lines insurance is sold to commercial customers and includes construction
insurance, commercial property insurance, commercial combined insurance, office and contents
insurance, professional indemnity insurance, fleet insurance, employer liability insurance, agriculture

122


-----

insurance, marine insurance and transport insurance. SME commercial lines insurance is sold to SMEs.
Specialist non-life commercial lines insurance is also sold to commercial customers in niche markets.

**_Life, pensions and other financial services insurance_**

Life, pensions and other financial services insurance is sold to individual customers and includes life
insurance, pensions, annuities and investment products.

**Insurance supply chain**

There are broadly three main activities in the insurance supply chain:

**_Providing risk capital_**

Risk taking activity in the insurance supply chain is undertaken by insurance companies who underwrite
insurance and expose their balance sheets to loss. Insurance companies earn income (i) from premiums;
and (ii) by investing their available reserves, that is, the amount of money at any given time collected
in premium but not yet paid out in claims.

Traditionally, insurance companies sold indirectly through intermediaries such as brokers and
underwriting agencies but in certain markets and product areas they now also sell insurance directly,
via telephone or online. Traditionally, insurance companies also performed all the services necessary
for providing insurance, including underwriting, administering insurance policies and handling
insurance claims and renewals. Today, many insurance companies outsource these services to
intermediaries.

**_Distribution_**

The distribution of insurance products is carried out by brokers, underwriting agencies and through
PCWs. In certain markets and product areas, insurers also distribute products directly to customers.

_Brokers_

Broking is the process by which a broker negotiates insurance policy terms for a customer and places
that customer’s risk with an appropriate insurance company either directly or through an underwriting
agency. Customers include businesses, individuals and public institutions, and, in the case of wholesale
brokers, other brokers. Brokers connect insurance companies and underwriting agencies with customers
in the insurance supply chain and so act as a distribution channel for insurance products. Insurance
companies and underwriting agencies, as the case may be, compensate brokers by means of
commissions based on premium levels and fees for individual services. In certain cases, brokers will
forego some or all of the commission payable by the insurance company and instead be compensated
by the customer for the placement service (particularly in personal lines).

_Underwriting agencies_

An underwriting agent serves as an intermediary between an insurance company and a broker or the
customer. In addition to providing underwriting services, some underwriting agencies act as MGA by
issuing and administering insurance policies and handling insurance claims and renewals on behalf of
insurance companies. Such underwriting agencies operate as “virtual insurers”, performing most
functions of a traditional insurance company including underwriting and pricing, but excluding the
provision of capital and the incurrence of liability in respect of insurance claims. The performance of
an underwriting agency can be judged by its underwriting results, the amount of total premiums earned
minus the cost of claims and operating expenses. Notably, there may be “loss-sharing” arrangements
put in place between the insurance company and the underwriting agency that can impact profitability,
depending on underwriting performance.

123


-----

_Price Comparison Websites (PCWs)_

PCWs are internet portals that allow insurance companies and insurance intermediaries to make their
insurance products available directly to customers via the internet. Customers can obtain several quotes
from insurance companies and insurance intermediaries on aggregator websites by making only one
data entry. The insurance company or insurance intermediary with the most appealing (by terms or
price) quote issues the insurance policy to the customer and compensates the PCW by means of a
referral fee.

PCWs are predominantly used to sell personal motor insurance policies and, to a lesser extent,
household insurance policies as well as other personal lines products. PCWs have had a limited impact
on the sale of commercial lines (except commercial auto) of insurance due to the complexity of the
products and the “off-line” advice sought by commercial customers for most commercial insurance
products.

In many cases, the PCW is reliant on another insurance intermediary, such as a broker or an
underwriting agency, to fulfill a number of critical activities such as managing the panel of insurers
whose products are available on the website. Similarly, an insurer may contract with a broker to manage
the insurer’s presence on a number of PCWs.

**_Service providers_**

_Network service providers_

Network service providers offer independent brokers access to insurance products that are not typically
available to independent brokers as well as enhanced agency terms, in effect operating as a buying club.
Network service providers also offer independent brokers access to certain business support services
such as handling of client money, risk & compliance and marketing.

_Service companies_

As insurers, MGAs, brokers and other participants in the insurance market look to improve cost
efficiencies in fulfillment, specialists offering business process outsourcing have become more
significant in the market. The initial focus of these service providers have been on claims fulfillment,
including completion of the first notification of loss, claims validation, litigation services, and other
associated claims services. These service providers have also branched out into other areas such as
customer services, sales campaign management, premium finance and white-labelled products.

**Insurance market structure and size**

_UK non-life insurance market_

The UK non-life insurance market grew by 6.7% in 2022 to £71.1 billion and is forecasted to grow to
£80.2 billion by 2027 according to Fitch Solutions.

The global non-life insurance market grew at a CAGR of 5.7% from 2000 to 2022 and is valued at $4
trillion. The map below presents the global insurance market on the basis of real non-life premium.

_International London market_

The international London market (the “London Market”) is the largest global center for commercial
and specialty risk with an emphasis on high-exposure, complex risk. Key types of risk insured in the
London Market include marine, aviation, catastrophe, professional indemnity and product liability. The
London Market controlled more than $121 billion of gross written premium in 2020 consisting of $84
billion written directly by London and $37 billion marketed and controlled through London according
to London Market Group.

**_Industry dynamics and trends_**

_Competitive landscape_

The competition for business has been one of the primary factors that has been driving broker
consolidation by non-vertically integrated players in the highly competitive UK market in recent years.
Consolidation is driven by the need to gain scale to effectively compete with larger, vertically integrated
players, particularly in the personal lines market. A variety of other factors have also driven these
acquisitions, including the increase in compliance and administrative costs resulting from new FCA
regulations, the aging broker demographic, recognition of the potential for economies of scale and the
consequent enhanced ability to compete effectively on price to drive increases in win-rates. The group
has a proven track record of M&A across all of its platforms, and believes there remain significant
opportunities to acquire brokers of varying sizes, which can add capabilities and customer volumes.

_UK Insurance distribution trends_

Brokers are the primary distribution channel in the UK non-life market.

Client purchasing behavior differs between customer types. Accordingly, brokers account for differing
percentages of GWP depending on the type of insurance being transacted with a large majority of
commercial premium transacted by brokers compared with a smaller amount of personal lines premium.

125


-----

Brokers will likely remain the largest SME market distribution channel due to the complexity of covers
required and development of digital capabilities.

With the expansion of the internet, the amount of personal insurance products sold by means of PCWs
has grown significantly. Expansion is expected to continue at a more modest rate as customers continue
to use PCWs. PCWs will likely continue to dominate the standard personal insurance markets, but will
increasingly look to other markets both geographically and from a product perspective. PCWs have
previously tried to sell other insurance products directly; however, they experience greater success when
partnering with existing product specialists. PCWs allow existing product specialists to make their
insurance products available directly to customers via the internet, and as such, PCWs are not direct
competitors of existing product specialists, but rather serve as intermediaries between them and end
customers.

_New emerging risks_

The broker’s role in connection with non-standard risks is becoming increasingly important. The market
is experiencing an increased appetite for newer risk categories, including cyber, supply chain and
legislative, and as more customers look to insure against these new risks, the role of advice and
significance of choice will become more important and the use of on brokers will subsequently increase.
This is in particular relevant to any complex, large or otherwise sophisticated risks, which demand a
broker-advised sale as opposed to a low involvement sale through PCWs.

_Increase in divestment / redistribution of unprofitable products or processes_

As all participants in the insurance market seek to improve profit margins, there is an increasing trend
for organizations to divest and outsource unprofitable products or processes to specialists who charge
an administrative fee or take a cut of commission. More of the larger insurers and other insurance
intermediaries, such as banks and retailers, are actively using white-labelled products from other
insurance providers. MGAs, brokers and other participants in the insurance market have also benefitted
from the use and distribution of white-labelled products.

_Increasing reliance on technology_

Technology is playing an increasingly important role in all aspects of the insurance market. Significant
investments are required by insurers and their distributors in order to ensure that customer service levels
remain high, fraud is controlled, product design is fit-for-purpose and underwriting risk is managed.
The use and analysis of data is critical to a successful insurance distribution chain.

_Data.”_

**Overview**

We are a highly diversified, leading independent insurance broker based in the UK operating at scale
across numerous segments of the non-life insurance market in the UK and internationally. We provide
a full range of non-life insurance products and related services across commercial, personal and
wholesale insurance. As an insurance distribution intermediary, our business primarily consists of
working with insurers to design, price, and administer insurance-related products and services, and as
such, we do not assume any underwriting or principal risk. From our formation in 2017 to the end of
2023, we have increased our revenue (excluding Retail) by over three times and our Adjusted EBITDA
(excluding Retail) by over five times, due to consistent strong organic growth and our proven
acquisition strategy. The foundations laid over the past five years have provided a platform for further
growth, which has positioned us, pro forma for all material acquisitions and disposals completed or
committed as of November 2, 2023, as a top 10 independent insurance broker and a top 20 insurance
broker globally according to Reinsurance News. In September 2023, we announced the merger and sale
of our Retail Business to Markerstudy in a transaction valuing the business at £1.2 billion. See
“Summary—Recent Developments—Retail Transaction.” For the twelve months ended September 30,
2023 and excluding Retail, we generated GWP of £12 billion, commissions and fees of £1.2 billion,
Total Pro Forma Income of £1.6 billion, organic growth of 11.6%, Total Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA
of £555.8 million and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA margin of 33%.

We offer a broad range of non-life insurance products in multiple geographies, ranging from higher
value and lower volume bespoke corporate insurance products placed in the London Market, to SMB
business insurance policies. Each aspect of our business is highly diversified with limited concentration
or dependence on any single product, channel, carrier, income producer, or supplier. We combine this
diversified operating model with a highly collaborative culture across the Group to provide our clients,
carriers, and employees with a high-quality product and service offering. We serve a wide range of
clients that include large MNCs, SMEs, individual consumers, and other third-party brokers and MGAs.

We distribute our insurance products across multiple channels, including through a network of over 120
local offices in the United Kingdom and more than 150 offices worldwide, and online. Our global
network provides the basis for deep, embedded local relationships and “trusted advisor” status with
clients and benefits from long-standing trusted insurer partner relationships. We also maintain regional
hubs to support our businesses through shared resources and expertise.

Following the signing of the Retail Transaction, we have taken steps to organize our business into two
main reporting segments, which we refer to as platforms, that focus on distinct but complementary
aspects of the insurance brokerage and services value chain. See “Summary—Recent Developments—
_Retail Transaction.”_

**Strengths**

**_Leading global independent broker positioned in resilient insurance markets_**

We are a highly diversified, leading, global independent insurance broker based in the United Kingdom.
Following our creation in 2017 as the result of a combination of long-established leading insurance
broking brands, we have rapidly grown into a top 20 global insurance broker by revenue.

4) Risk & Insurance business of Marsh only.
5) Pro forma for acquisition of Tiger Risk and Marsh R.S.
6) Pro forma for all material acquisitions and disposals completed or contractually committed as of November 2, 2023, and converted
to U.S. dollars at an exchange rate of £1 to $1.22.

We have a depth of specialist and local knowledge built-up over many years, and entrenched client
relationships and deep community penetration. We believe that our scale and diversified proposition
provides us with the ability to effectively compete with even our largest competitors and service over
four million clients as a result of our broad industry knowledge and depth of understanding of customer
needs from our team of over 8,000 professionals across more than 150 offices globally. The scale of
premium we place in the market also allows us to capture incremental earnings across the insurance
value chain and reduce costs.

As a leading global independent insurance broker, we are well positioned to continue to benefit from
the resilient and growing global non-life insurance market. The global non-life insurance market has
proven highly resilient across cycles and recessions, and has been continually growing. The global nonlife market has experienced growth of approximately 3% per annum over the past twenty years, and has
demonstrated resilience through a long track record of stable GWP growth with limited impact from
past economic or capital market downturns as demonstrated by the below chart.

As compared to other sectors, our sector benefits from low volatility and proved to be one of the most
resilient sectors through the COVID-19 pandemic. The growth in the industry is supported by favorable
market dynamics. Brokers can, in middle market segments, promote strong client relations as a result
of this low volatility and foster recurring revenue. We were able to maintain organic growth of
approximately 3% from 2017 through 2020, and increased organic growth (excluding Retail) of 10.2%,
12.5% and 11.6% in 2021, 2022 and the twelve months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.

We are regionally diversified, earning 34% of our GWPs for the twelve months ended September 30,
2023 (excluding the Retail Transaction) in the UK, 30% in North America, 15% in Europe, 10% in the
APAC region, 8% in the LATAM region and 3% in the AMEA region, and our worldwide business is
positioned at the center of global insurance markets as shown on the map below.

-----

Our global presence covers the major global insurance hubs and provides us with global access and
insight. We established Ardonagh Global Partners in 2021 to invest in strong platforms operating in
attractive markets and verticals outside the UK and Europe and to partner with management teams who
want to grow faster as part of a larger group while retaining operational independence. Since its
inception, Ardonagh Global Partners has grown to include Resilium, one of Australia’s largest
independently-owned intermediary networks and the founding business of our Australia platform, and
Ethos Broking Australia, which invests in or directly acquires brokers. Ardonagh Global Partners also
includes Hemsley Wynne Furlonge, a specialist M&A warranty and indemnity insurance broker and
advisor, MDS Group, an insurance broker and risk management advisor across the Portuguese-speaking
world and Europe, the only Portuguese Lloyd’s Broker and the largest independent broker in Brazil,
and Envest, an Australian-based insurance investment and distribution group, which now houses
Australian assets Resilium and Epsilon Underwriting within the Group.

**_Scaled platform with significant diversification across geographies and capabilities_**

Our business is highly diversified across products, customers, channels, geographies and carriers. We
offer a wide-ranging product portfolio across both general and bespoke insurance products and services
across the insurance value chain, including personal and commercial lines, wholesale distribution,
underwriting and insurance outsourcing services to large corporations, insurers, third-party brokers,
SMEs, and individual consumers at a variety of price points, without assuming any underwriting or
principal risk in relation to any of the services or products that we provide. For the twelve months ended
September 30, 2023, no single line of business accounted for more than 20% of GWP. We reach
customers through diverse distribution channels, including through our digital platform, telephone
contact centers, and traditional face-to-face customer contact via our network of over 150 offices
globally.

As a result of our international presence, our GWP is diversified by geography, with 66% of our
premium (excluding the Retail Transaction) placed outside the UK (specifically, 30% of our premium
is placed in North America and 15% is placed in Europe). We have long-standing partnerships with key
carriers, and relationships more broadly with a wide range of insurance carriers in each of the markets
that we serve. Our large number of carrier relationships mitigates potential carrier concentration risks
and enables us to enhance and improve our product offerings for clients as well as pricing and our own

commercial terms. For the twelve months ended September 30, 2023, no single carrier accounted for
more than 7% of our total GWP, with the top five carriers in aggregate representing less than 25% of
total GWP. Our gross written premiums by geographical region, class of business and carrier are shown
in the chart below:

_______

(2) LTM premiums to September 2023; pro forma to exclude Retail and include Assepro.

Our highly diversified offering ensures minimal reliance on any particular product, distribution channel,
customer, or market, limiting our exposure to any adverse industry developments and macroeconomic
factors and thereby mitigating volatility in our overall financial performance. In addition, the breadth
of our offering provides us with various avenues through which we can identify gaps in the market and
develop specialized products to capture unmet demand. We are thus able take advantage of cross-selling
opportunities to increase our customer penetration and drive incremental growth.

**_Robust, accelerating organic growth benefitting from the realization of key strategic initiatives_**

We have a track record of delivering strong organic income and margin growth. By leveraging our
scaled platform and best practices, we have negotiated superior terms with insurer counterparties,
industry participants, and suppliers, enabling us to offer a better experience and pricing to our
customers. We also value diversity and keeping up with current technologic trends, prioritizing
investments in people and data and technology. As a result, we have grown the business every quarter
(compared with the prior year period) since our establishment in 2017 and have achieved double-digit
organic growth since 2021, growing 10.2% in 2021, 12.5% in 2022 and 11.6% (excluding Retail) in the
twelve months ended September 30, 2023. Our organic growth is driven, in part, by our key strategic
initiatives across our segments, as outlined below.

_Global P&C: UK Advisory_

- _Drive new business: Targeting large corporate clients with focused expertise and leveraging_
data and single customer view to cross-sell products within Advisory and between platforms

- _Enhanced placement: Reducing the number of markets from 750 to 185 to improve client_
outcomes and reduce costs, giving partners white label access to existing binders and
specialties, which allows them the opportunity to re-brand such binders and products, and
leveraging increased scale to increase commission rates paid by customers across business

- _Grow our digital proposition: Enhancing our online offering to improve the customer journey_
and reduce costs, and entering into affinity partner deals

132


-----

- _Integration:_ Focusing on integration through significant new opportunities for value creation
with rapid integration of further “add-on” accretive acquisitions

_Global P&C: International Advisory_

- _Identify strategic markets: Focusing on select regions that fulfill our acquisition criteria and_
clearly focus on larger, more sophisticated markets with growing macroeconomic conditions
and a developed regulatory environment

- _Utilize networks:_ Leveraging our networks and the wider broker networks to identify suitable
assets and targeting attractive off-market opportunities at below market multiples

- _Realize synergies:_ Rapidly integrating acquisitions to realize significant cost and revenue
synergies

- _Roll-out best practices: Establishing initiatives to accelerate organic growth and improve_
margin and cash flow conversion, and to provide access to new products and capacity

_Specialty Broking_

- _Producer hires:_ Driving existing producer hires to maturity and hiring new individuals who can
add value quickly with a relentless focus on renewal retention, leveraging existing retail and
wholesale relationships

- _Digital solutions:_ Leveraging and overlaying external tools to attract new business and protect
existing business, employing digital solutions to get us closer to our end client

- _Portfolio & Placement:_ Engaging with Ardonagh Portfolio Solutions (“APS”) for select lines
such as terrorism, financial institution, personal injury and cyber in order to increase
commissions, and actively managing portfolio to reduce exposure to underperforming lines

- _Global strategy: Maximizing inflow from growing Global P&C platform, leveraging network_
memberships to increase existing business and inflow and capitalizing on footprint to drive
further growth

Our organic growth has been further supported over the past five years by delivering value from our
new producer hires. We have generated Adjusted EBITDA of approximately £30 million for the twelve
months ended September 30, 2023 from 29 maturing producer teams hired since 2020. Teams typically
mature to their full profitability potential approximately three years after the expiry of capacity or
covenant restriction. We have seven teams hired in 2020 that were at 75% maturity as of September 30,
2023, seven teams hired in 2021 at 58% maturity as of September 30, 2023, eight teams hired in 2022
at 37% maturity as of September 30, 2023 and six teams that started trading in the nine months ended
September 30, 2023. As a result, we expect to realize additional Adjusted EBITDA as a result of these
hires over the next three years.

**_Proven ability to grow through thoughtful, highly accretive acquisitions and disciplined integration_**

We have a long-term track record and well-established process for identifying, executing, and
integrating highly accretive acquisitions across many geographies. We have completed or entered into
acquisition agreements for more than 150 acquisitions since our establishment in 2017, which represents
an enterprise value of over £3.2 billion with a year-to-date average “add-on” enterprise value multiple
of 6.6 times and a “platform” enterprise value multiple of 9.6 times. We also have a further 36
acquisitions that are contractually committed or under signed letter of intent as of February 1, 2024,
which would contribute an additional £32.2 million of Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA.This track record
of successful acquisitions is shown in the below chart.

We have built our Global P&C franchise by building on our UK Advisory business and carefully
selected regional platforms. We have built our Specialty Broking business by investing in carefully
strategic producer hires and specialisms. In the past three years, we have expanded our addressable
markets through acquisitions in new synergistic geographies. In 2020, we acquired our first non-UK
business, Arachas, Ireland’s largest commercial insurance broker, which kick-started our international
operations. We have since established our latest standalone platform, International Advisory, under
which we are consolidating our non-UK broking enterprises and related investments and under which
we have launched our Ardonagh Europe and our Ardonagh Global Partners businesses. We established
Ardonagh Global Partners in 2021 to invest in leading platforms operating in attractive markets and
verticals outside the UK and Europe and to partner with management teams who want to grow faster as
part of a larger group while retaining operational independence. Since its inception, Ardonagh Global
Partners has grown to include various brands, including Resilium, one of Australia’s largest
independently owned intermediary networks and the founding business of our Australian platform and
Ethos Broking Australia, which invests in or directly acquires brokers. We continue to have a robust
M&A pipeline, and we continue to explore larger transaction opportunities both in the UK and
internationally with a strong focus on market-leading platforms in our international business.

To successfully complete and integrate such a large amount of acquisitions, we follow a clear,
disciplined and highly selective acquisition strategy. We encourage competition between segments in
order to receive centrally controlled capital for acquisitions, and we employ a rigorous due diligence
process that is implemented by our highly experienced and dedicated team of investment professionals.
Given the scope of our operational footprint, we are also able to leverage deep local knowledge in our
markets in order to further understand our targets. Our primary focus when reviewing potential
opportunities is on the customer proposition and financial returns. We have also implemented a robust
and efficient integration and post-deal tracking process after closing.

134


-----

Our disciplined execution focuses on a clear, orderly and highly selective strategy based on ten
principles: strategic fit, cultural fit, integration commitment, aligned incentives, financial returns,
synergy discipline, cash discipline, realistic plan, risk assessment and clear accountability. We perform
a rigorous due diligence process through a highly experienced and dedicated team of investment
professionals, leveraging deep local knowledge in the markets where we operate and a robust and
efficient integration and post-deal tracking process. We are able to present ourselves as the acquirer of
choice by emphasizing our culture, aligning interests and maintaining discipline. In addition, we have
made significant investments in our technology platform, which allows us to integrate new acquisitions
at low cost and with low integration risk.

**_Leading data and analytics capabilities driving platform efficiencies_**

Our leading centralized data and analytics capabilities allow us to enhance risk solutions for capacity
providers and improve outcomes for our clients and to drive cost savings. These capabilities have been
primarily utilized to support the building of broker facilities, which then allow us to access
predominantly traditional capacity in more efficient ways for the client. For example, we have used data
and analytics to significantly improve and re-package older previous products into better terms, cover
and product for our clients, including improvements on the Terrorism, Fine Art Jewellery and Specie
facilities. We have also used data and analytics to introduce brand new facilities to the market, such as
a Construction facility and a cross-class facility named LECTIO. The following chart shows our
centralized data analytics structure, where we have centralized global premium and carrier information
using our data center based in Mullingar, Ireland.

As an example, in our Specialty Broking platform, we have built facilities such as the Ardonagh
Portfolio Solutions (“APS”) business to use data analytics and capabilities to bring benefits to both
clients, in terms of wider market placement, and our Group, in terms of increased revenues.

Our technology and scale facilities have also allowed us to identify cost savings totalling approximately
£15.8 million that we expect to achieve within the next 12 months. In our Global P&C: UK Advisory
segment, we expect cost savings of £3.2 million, primarily as a result of a target model implementation
project that has reduced headcount through efficiency gains from optimizing policy administration
systems, an IT transformation from improving the office network, which is aimed at removing legacy
applications and outsourcing, and an onshoring finance project expected to deliver benefits from process
efficiencies and automation. In our Global P&C: International Advisory segment, we expect cost
savings of £3.9 million from synergies through our hub-and-spoke model and by integrating further

135


-----

acquisitions into our existing platforms. In our Specialty Broking segment, we expect cost savings of
£8.2 million from a technology-led transformation of middle- and back-office functions. We have also
identified cost synergies in connection with the acquisition of Corant Global, including harmonization
of reward structures, footprint consolidation and back-office optimization, and the acquisition of the
Oxford Insurance Group. We have also identified cost savings of £0.5 million through back-office
optimization in our Corporate function.

**_Attractive financial profile with strong growth, profitability and cash flow conversion_**

Since our establishment in 2017, we have delivered a transformational improvement in our quality of
earnings and have had strong performance across all metrics. We experienced a four times increase in
revenue (including Retail) from 2017 to Total Pro Forma Income (excluding Retail) in the twelve
months ended September 30, 2023 and a seven times increase in Adjusted EBITDA (including Retail)
to Total Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA (excluding Retail) during the same period. We also experienced
a more than eight percentage points increase in organic growth from 2017 to the twelve months ended
September 30, 2023 (excluding Retail) and a more than 13 percentage point increase in Adjusted
EBITDA margin over the same time period (excluding Retail).

We have designed our business model to generate high EBITDA margins with limited working capital
and maintenance capital expenditure requirements, resulting in management operating cash flow of
£420 million and an operating cash conversion of 86% in the twelve months ended September 30, 2023.
Since our establishment, we have delivered a transformational improvement in quality of earnings,
primarily as a result of significant investments towards transformative cost-savings programs and
synergy initiatives in our business to create a scalable and efficient platform that is conducive to future
growth, resulting in approximately £150 million of realized cost-savings since the start of 2018. Our
investments have resulted in a continued and rapid improvement in our quality of earnings as cost
savings are delivered and one-time costs have decreased. We believe that our cash generative business
model is highly scalable and that we will be able to leverage our well-invested infrastructure as we
continue to grow organically and via acquisitions.

Our transformational improvement in quality of earnings has improved cash generation. In the twelve
months ended September 30, 2023, we had management operating cash flow of £420 million and an
operating cash conversion of 86% in the twelve months ended September 30, 2023. We believe that our
cash generative business model is highly scalable and that we will be able to leverage our well-invested
infrastructure as we continue to grow organically and via acquisitions. The continuing contribution from
new producer hires already made but not yet at maturity and from enhanced and alternative capacity
arrangements in place to better serve our existing customers also supports our cash generation.

**_Deep, aligned management team well positioned to drive culture and lead ongoing growth_**

Our management team is highly experienced in leading and growing successful insurance intermediary
organizations. Our Chief Executive Officer, David Ross, has over 25 years of industry experience
building and leading brokerage businesses including leading transformative mergers and acquisitions
in the insurance intermediary field. Mr. Ross is supported by a highly experienced management team
with over 25 years of industry experience on average, with a strong track record of delivering on
transformative change and investment. Our Chief Financial Officer, Diane Cougill, has over 20 years
of industry experience and has held senior leadership positions at RAC and at Aviva. Our senior
management team also includes Aurelio Cusaro, our Chief Investment Officer, John Tiner, our
Chairman, Geoff Gouriet, our General Counsel, and Sarah Dalgarno, our Chief Risk Officer. Our Global
P&C senior management includes Rob Worrell, Chief Executive Officer of our UK Advisory segment,
Conor Brennan, Chairman of our International Advisory segment and Des O’Connor, Chief Investment
Officer of our International Advisory segment. Our Specialty Broking senior management includes
Chief Executive Officer Andrew Wallin and Chairman James Masterson. Together, this team leads a
deep bench of revenue-producing talent and committed operational support staff, all of whom have been
specifically targeted for their entrepreneurial spirit and ability to drive sustainable revenue growth. The
culture cultivated by our senior management team leads to our continued success in the insurance
market and differentiates itself from other competitors in various ways, including:

  - An emphasis on entrepreneurship at a local level with strong organizational alignment, resulting
in colleagues working together towards common, Group-wide objectives,

  - Continuous cross-group collaboration to amplify the best of our collective experience and
insight,

  - The application of the depth and breadth of our specialist expertise, built through years of
market leadership,

  - Our tailored and innovative solutions and ability to understand what works for each industry,
market and client,

  - Our deep relationships with clients built through longstanding service, accountability and trust,
and

  - Our regular programming to celebrate special accomplishments and promote internal events.

These factors have resulted in over 90% client retention based on strong relationships, knowledge and
expertise, stickiness of specialist products and high barriers to entry, and 95% average producer
retention across last five years (excluding non-regrettable leavers), as a result of our ability to leverage
a broader platform, our emphasis on training, development and support, our aligned incentives with
producers and our collaborative and cohesive culture.

Management and employees are incentivized directly or indirectly through a combination of B ordinary
share ownership at Tara Topco Limited and/or participation in various broad equity and performance
schemes, the value of which are linked to the achievement of long term, sustainable, and profitable
growth. We also benefit from the support, significant investment experience and industry network in
the insurance broking and underwriting market of our long-term majority shareholders, HPS Investment
Partners and Madison Dearborn Partners, who in aggregate directly or indirectly own over 90% of our
equity capital. HPS Investment Partners and Madison Dearborn Partners have been highly supportive
of our management and have demonstrated their continued commitment to Ardonagh by investing $2.7
billion in common equity over the past years.

**Strategies**

**_Accelerate organic growth by optimizing placement strategy and driving new business through new_**
**_products, cross-selling and up-selling_**

We seek to consistently achieve double-digit organic growth across our overall business by expanding
product portfolios, streamlining operations, increasing penetration of our customer base—particularly
in new synergistic geographies—through concerted sales efforts across our Group and capitalizing on
a targeted acquisitions pipeline. We have a growing pipeline of new specialist products that is highly
complementary to our existing offerings, including high net worth, political violence, specialty
terrorism facility. These products are being developed on existing systems and channels at limited
upfront cost and are largely linked to new hires, who can contribute the relevant product and channel
expertise. As an example, new products launched in our Specialty Broking platform contributed towards
organic growth of approximately 11.6% in the twelve months ended September 30, 2023.

As part of our organic growth strategy, we are also focused on cross-selling and up-selling and customer
retention and expansion. We seek to improve cross-selling and up-selling across Group clients,
including by leveraging data. We have rolled out of a Group-wide database in which we collate data
from each of our platforms to enable a “single view of the client” (i.e., how many policies are linked to
each client across personal and commercial lines) to facilitate retention, cross-selling and up-selling.
This database continues to provide a more granular understanding of our clients’ needs, allowing us to
offer them tailored cross-selling opportunities. We have also implemented a bespoke pricing system
and leveraged our data infrastructure, fraud detection capabilities and access to third-party data sources
to improve retention and increase customer lifetime value across most products. In our Specialty
Broking platform, we have developed a highly sophisticated customer and broker-facing software
which interfaces with several market-leading policy administrative systems and substantially improves
ease of access to customer and broker data. We are also in discussions with several third-party brokers
who are clients of our wholesale platform to roll-out this software in order to maximize efficiency and
centralization within our platform and improve the experience of third-party brokers on our platform.
We also intend to leverage our membership of the Worldwide Broker Network to increase existing
business and in-flow through the establishment of new relationships and intend to capitalize on our
existing global footprint to drive further growth. In the UK, our UK Advisory business launched a
focused client strategy aimed at large UK corporates, which is already bearing fruit with the successful
signing of several marquee clients, including a global broadcaster that has a £5 billion turnover and also
the UK’s largest charity.

In addition, in 2021, we launched Inver Re, a new risk strategy and reinsurance broker with ambitions
to harness our scale, resources and reach to offer a credible alternative to global brokers and become
our industry’s independent reinsurance broker of choice. We plan to further strengthen our reinsurance
operations by (i) consolidating our existing reinsurance operations while organically building out our
brand, talent and capabilities in key global hubs (such as London, North America & Bermuda), (ii)
developing our first party business through leveraging key group carrier relationships, (iii) hiring
industry leading talent and building further revenue streams and (iv) deploying M&A to expand
geographic focus beyond key hubs (such as in Latin America and Asia).

**_Streamline operations through our continued focus on capacity excellence, talent excellence and_**
**_operational excellence_**

We are constantly re-examining our operating models to incrementally streamline lower value-add
operations and further support our front-office distribution and client service capabilities. We have
developed a range of strategies to streamline operations and optimize middle and back-office functions.
Our strategy is based on three key pillars of excellence, which are:

- _Capacity excellence. We seek to reach capacity excellence by operating a strategic capacity_
model through our Ardonagh Portfolio Solutions (“APS”) business, part of our Specialty
Broking platform. APS utilizes data captured from across the Group’s platforms and businesses
to enhance income through a centralized placement. We expect our APS business to be a key
growth driver going forward by allowing us to capitalize on a select number of strategic carrier
relationships, create market leading products which offer better terms for our customers and
access alternative capital providers either directly or in connection with our MGA business. We
intend to engage with APS for select high-profitability lines and actively manage the portfolio
to reduce exposure to underperforming lines.

- _Talent excellence. We believe that we will be able to deliver significant incremental income_
and EBITDA growth by nurturing talent excellence. We are working to attract the best people
in our industry and are ideally placed to capitalize on market dislocation. We believe that
incoming hires bring capabilities and are highly accretive. We have a strong track record of
income hires and producer recruitment, delivering significant incremental income and
EBITDA. We intend to leverage our success to date to continue selective transformational hires,
focusing on hiring exceptional individuals who can swiftly add value to our Group. Since 2019,
we have secured at least five new specialist team hires per year, and currently have a deep
pipeline of future hires. We also intend to deliver on exceptional existing hires, relentlessly
focusing on renewal retention, leveraging existing retail and wholesale relationships.

- _Operational excellence. We believe that through operational excellence we can continue our_
track record of delivering value through our focus on operational expertise. We have delivered
cost efficiencies to drive margin expansion across all divisions, resulting in approximately £150
million of synergies and cost savings delivered to date since the start of 2018, and £15.8 million
of cost savings and cost synergies expected to be delivered within the next twelve months,
consisting of (i) £3.2 million within the UK Advisory platform resulting from benefits from a
target operating model implementation project that has reduced headcount through efficiency
gains from optimizing policy administration systems, IT transformations from improving the
office network, removing legacy applications and outsourcing and an onshoring finance project
expected to deliver benefits from process efficiencies and automation, (ii) £8.2 million within
the Specialty Broking platform resulting from the technology-led transformation of our middle
and back office functions and the cost synergies identified with the acquisition of Corant
Global, including the harmonization of reward structures, footprint consolidation and backoffice optimization, as well as the acquisition of Oxford Insurance, (iii) £3.9 million within the
International Advisory platform through the ‘hub and spoke’ model and the integration of
further acquisitions into existing platforms and (iv) £0.5 million through back-office
optimization in our Corporate segment.

We also continue to make significant investments into our technology platform, as we believe that
digital solutions will get us closer to our end client, allowing us to leverage and overlay external tools
to attract new business and protect existing business.

**_Expand our addressable markets in new synergistic geographies_**

We intend to continue expanding our addressable markets in synergistic geographies. In 2021 we
established our International Advisory platform, under which we are consolidating our non-UK broking

139


-----

enterprises and related investments and under which we have launched our Ardonagh Europe and our
Ardonagh Global Partners businesses. We established Ardonagh Global Partners in 2021 to invest in
leading platforms operating in attractive markets and verticals outside the UK and Europe and to partner
with management teams who want to grow faster as part of a larger group while retaining operational
independence. We intend to continue growing our International Advisory platform with the aim of
consolidating our presence in a selected portfolio of fast-growing markets and expanding participation
in select new products and markets where there is significant synergy between our UK platforms and
our International Advisory platform. We are focusing on a number of regions which fulfil our
acquisition criteria, and intend to employ the hub and spoke methodology to quickly expand our
regional presence. Our aim is to develop a number of regional hubs, with specialist knowledge,
technology and product expertise, to support in-country assets, and we intend to focus on strategic
markets with assets that are capable of executing further in-country expansion.

**_Continue to grow by capitalizing on targeted acquisitions pipeline_**

As part of our strategy, we target additional growth expected from accretive acquisitions, and intend to
further strengthen our position and broaden our portfolio by continuing to consolidate smaller players
in the highly fragmented and competitive UK and international insurance markets. Any acquisition we
pursue will be in line with our targeted and selective acquisition criteria focused on companies with
attractive profitability, growth potential and complementary business operations. We utilize our
network to identify suitable targets at reasonable multiples. We support acquired assets post-acquisition
in order to achieve our organic growth plans going forward, utilizing our expertise and networks. We
also manage the realization of identified revenue and cost synergies on an ongoing basis. We have a
highly disciplined and proven acquisition program, which includes a standardized approach to
integration and synergy delivery, which, together with the proven execution ability of our management
team and our strong focus on value creation and financial metrics, allows us to maximize synergies and
rapidly deploy economies of scale to acquired businesses.

We have a robust M&A pipeline underpinned by a rigorous evaluation and assessment process driven
by an experienced and dedicated team of M&A professionals, and we continue to explore larger
transaction opportunities both in the UK and internationally with a strong focus on market-leading
platforms in our international business. Acquisitions completed during the fourth quarter of 2023
(including the impact of the AccuRisk disposal) contributed Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA of £13.6
million for the twelve months ended September 30, 2023, and acquisitions completed between January
1, 2024 and February 1, 2024 contributed an additional £3.0 million. We have a further 36 acquisitions
that are contractually committed or under signed letter of intent as of February 1, 2024, which would
contribute an additional £32.2 million of Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA. Our pipeline includes targets
on multiple continents. We are also actively pursuing other acquisitions in the near-term or very nearterm, including one or more potentially material acquisitions.

**History**

We were established in 2017 through the combination of several insurance services providers into a
single multi-product and multi-channel platform led by a highly experienced senior management team
with the aim of fostering innovation in the insurance market. Since our establishment, we have
continued to grow through a combination of a sustained focus on organic growth, operational excellence
and a highly disciplined expense strategy, and acquisition program, which includes a standardized
approach to integration and synergy delivery, and which we believe allows us to maximize synergies
and rapidly deploy economies of scale to acquired businesses.

Our business strategy has followed a three phased strategy. During our first phase, from founding in
2017 until 2019, our focus was primarily on establishing scale and making our UK businesses key
competitors in their segments, specifically our Retail business containing our UK personal lines
business and our Specialty Broking business containing our London markets wholesale business, and

140


-----

adding niche and specialist lines to our commercial and SME business to create the UK Advisory
business. Our strategy was to integrate acquisitions and streamline the operations through centralized,
in-country IT and data, carrier placements and back office functions. During our second phase, between
2019 and 2022, we shifted our focus to broader international expansion, acquiring businesses with the
aim to diversify and expand our footprint while continuing to focus on operational excellence, with the
aim of improving margins in our UK markets. With the integration of acquisitions and our disciplined
approach to operational excellence, we have delivered approximately £150 million of synergies and
cost savings since the start of 2018. In the third phase of our strategy, beginning in 2023, our focus has
been to release capital unlocked by the Retail Transaction to invest in our higher organic growth Global
P&C and Specialty Broking platforms, predominantly in international markets. See “—Retail—Retail
_Transaction” below. The chart below shows the evolution of our main segments over the past three_
years.

Since 2017, we have completed more than 150 acquisitions, and in 2023 alone we completed 67
acquisitions. Our major acquisitions since mid-2020 include, among others:

- Arachas, a commercial insurance broker in Ireland, in 2020;

- Bravo, which comprises Broker Network and Compass, two established network service
providers to regional insurance brokers and Ethos Broking, a highly active acquisition platform
focused on the UK regional insurance market, in 2020;

- Resilium Pty Limited, the founding business of our Australian platform, in February 2021;

- Hemsley Wynne Furlong LLP, a specialist M&A warranty and indemnity insurance broker and
advisor, in March 2021;

- Usay Group Limited, one of the largest consumer personal medical insurance and protection
insurance brokers in the UK, in September 2021;

- the Hooper Dolan companies, a client-focused general insurance broker with offices across
Ireland, in October 2021;

- the insurance operations of BGC Partners Inc., a leading global brokerage and financial
technology company, in November 2021;

- the Léons Group, a family-owned independent insurance brokerage and consultancy firm based
in the Netherlands, in October 2022;

- Glennon Insurances, a leading provider of insurance solutions in Ireland, in December 2022;

141


-----

- the MDS Group, an insurance broker and risk management advisor primarily based in Portugal
and Brazil, with offices in Angola, Mozambique, Spain, Switzerland and Malta, in December
2022;

- Envest PTY Limited, an Australian insurance investment and distribution group, in February
2023;

- the Oxford Insurance Group, a Lloyd’s broker with further operations in Switzerland,
Liechtenstein and Dubai, in March 2023;

- the SRS Group, an Athens-based group whose businesses include a independent wholesale
reinsurance broker and a managing general agencies (“MGA”) platform, in June 2023;

- Klap Verzekeringsmakelaar, a Dutch specialist commercial lines insurance broker, in June
2023;

- Classicus, a high-net-worth broker headquartered in the Netherlands, in August 2023; and

- ASSEPRO, one of the largest independent commercial brokers for small and medium-sized
enterprises in Switzerland, with additional operations in Austria and Liechtenstein, in
November 2023.

Our Group’s customers span from individuals to global corporations through our rapidly growing
international presence. The chart below illustrates how we connect customers to insurance capacity
across our full scope of products and services:

**Our Business**

Following the announcement of the Retail Transaction, our business has been organized into two main
reporting segments, which we refer to as platforms, that focus on distinct but complementary aspects of
the insurance brokerage and services value chain. Global P&C (which is comprised of UK Advisory
and International Advisory) and Specialty Broking.

We also currently own a Retail segment, which houses several digitally focused personal lines brands
which offer home, motor and pet insurance alongside a range of specialist personal and small business

142


-----

insurance products. In September 2023, we announced the Retail Transaction, following which Retail
will no longer be part of the Group. See “—Retail—Retail Transaction” below.

In addition, we maintain a non-operating Corporate segment comprising central costs and income
(primarily interest income) not allocated to our reporting segments.

**_Global P&C_**

The Global P&C platform, comprised of the UK Advisory and International Advisory platforms, is a
global broking platform mainly focused on SME and mid-corporate clients with strong market positions
across key geographies. The platform has a global network of more than 100 locations, which provides
for deeply embedded local and “trusted advisor” status with clients. Global P&C offers a broad product
set and maintains a highly active M&A strategy with a significant global pipeline of accretive bolt-ons.

_UK Advisory_

The UK Advisory platform provides a broad range of insurance broking products and advice on
insurance, risk management and employee benefits to SMEs, large corporations and individual
customers.

For the twelve months ended September 30, 2023, UK Advisory generated £512.6 million of Total Pro
Forma Income and £162.6 million of Total Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA.

As part of UK Advisory, we offer tailored insurance broking services to our clients via in-person,
telephony, and online communications, providing them with a broad range of choices and access to
specialist products and solutions designed to meet individual needs across the full spectrum of
commercial, corporate and personal classes. The primary lines of coverage in our UK Advisory platform
include motor fleet, commercial, property, liability, professional indemnity, and contractors. We also
provide standard non-specialist insurance products tailored to specific sectors or risks that may be more
difficult to place elsewhere in the insurance market. UK Advisory maintains a strong community focus
through our network of over 120 offices across the United Kingdom. SME insurance intermediary
products require industry and customer expertise to develop and market effectively, and we believe that
SME customers value direct relationship management and advisory services when purchasing such
specialized products, which we are able to provide via our local office network.

UK Advisory operates through seven community-focused brands:

- Towergate Insurance Brokers: one of the UK’s leading independent insurance brokers and risk
management advisors providing commercial and specialist lines insurance to clients all over
the UK;

- Towergate Health & Protect: health, protection and employee benefits;

- Riskline: specialist, micro-SME focused proposition;

- Footman James: specialist classic car brand with a high-net-worth client base;

- Usay: consumer private medical insurance (“PMI”) and protection;

- Ethos Broking: regional niche and specialist broking; and

- Bravo Network: contains two of the largest networks of independent regional brokers in the
UK – Broker Network and Compass – providing insurance broking to SME businesses in the
UK.

143


-----

Towergate Insurance Brokers and Towergate Health and Protection products are sold mainly through
face-to-face relationships via the Towergate brand. Riskline is a center of excellence selling to microSMEs over the phone and online. Footman James is an established brand in the classic car insurance
sector (within the wider private motor insurance market) selling directly to consumers and, as such,
aligns to our broader high-net-worth proposition across our UK Advisory platform as a whole. Ethos
Broking and Bravo Networks provide insurance broking and member services with an SME focus via
community broking offices and a network presence. Additionally, Towergate Insurance Brokers is a
member of the Worldwide Broker Network, and can as such collaborate with other independent brokers
worldwide to deliver cross-border insurance programs.

UK Advisory is an established M&A powerhouse with a track record of successfully implementing its
acquisition strategy. Since June 2020, UK Advisory has completed 28 acquisitions, including: Bravo,
Guy Penn, Sennet, Headley, AFL Retail, Chambers & Newman, Hera, Drayton Insurance, Murton
Alexander, Thompson & Bryan, Schofields, USAY, Lorega, Stallard Kane Group, The Professional
Indemnity Company, PB Curran, Sentinel Insurance Solutions Limited, AMS Insurance Solutions,
Sorvio Insurance Brokers Limited and RiskSTOP Group. We also have a significant pipeline of
potential, accretive bolt-on acquisitions, including through our hub-and-spoke consolidation platform,
Ethos, and Bravo Network, which comprises Broker Network and Compass, two established network
service providers to regional insurance brokers with approximately 615 members that provide a pool to
identify and execute accretive acquisitions.

_International Advisory_

The International Advisory platform consists of our non-UK broking enterprises. International Advisory
focuses on leveraging our existing scale, assets and wholesale market access to increase overall value.
We aim to develop regional hubs through hub-and-spoke methodology to build in-country assets and
support their rapid expansion through shared resources and expertise. For the twelve months ended
September 30, 2023, International Advisory generated £516.5 million of Total Pro Forma Income and
£201.1 million of Total Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA.

Our largest business in our International Advisory platform is based in Ireland and trades under our
Arachas brand. Arachas, an Irish SME-focused commercial insurance broker with specialized offerings
and a nationwide reach, has quickly gained a leading position in its core markets. Arachas has grown
rapidly through a combination of strong organic growth and targeted acquisition of synergistic
businesses, including O’Driscoll O’Neil DAC in 2020, Hooper Dolan and BJP Insurance Brokers in
2021 and Glennon Insurances in 2022. Other continental European businesses include Klap, Leon and
Classicus in the Netherlands and ASSEPRO, acquired in late 2023, which trades in Austria and
Switzerland.

In 2021, we focused on investing in markets and verticals outside the UK and Europe and partnering
with management teams who want to grow faster as part of a larger group while retaining operational
independence. This included our acquisition of Resilium, a large, independently owned intermediary
network in Australia and Ethos Broking Australia, which invests in or directly acquires brokers. In
December 2022, we acquired the MDS Group, an insurance broker and risk management advisor across
the Portuguese-speaking world and Europe, the only Portuguese Lloyd’s Broker and the largest
independent broker in Brazil, and in February 2023 we acquired Envest, an Australian-based insurance
investment and distribution group, which now houses Australian assets Resilium and Epsilon
Underwriting within the Group.

**_Specialty Broking_**

The Specialty Broking platform combines expertise in specialist underwriting with the placing of
bespoke complex risk products for large UK and international corporate clients. Specialty Broking
operates through globally recognized heritage brands, including Price Forbes, Bishopsgate, Ed Broking,

144


-----

Inver Re, Piiq Risk Partners, and Robus. Specialty Broking is London headquartered and in close
proximity to Lloyd’s of London and the London market, sourcing business from over 180 countries
worldwide. For the twelve months ended September 30, 2023, Specialty Broking generated £535.1
million of Total Pro Forma Income and £193.4 million of Total Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA.

Through our Lloyd’s of London brokerage business, which is one of the largest independent wholesale
broker in the London market with offices around the globe, we provide UK and international corporate
clients with open market programs, reinsurance and international solutions designed to empower clients
to achieve their strategic ambitions. Price Forbes, one of the world’s oldest specialty insurance brands,
and Bishopsgate provide UK and international corporate clients with access to specialist sector
insurance products covering a wide range of markets, including energy, North American property,
marine, power, aviation, specie (covering high-value, portable items such as gemstones and bullion),
cargo, mining and terrorism. Since June 2020, we completed the acquisitions of Robus and Rural
Insurance, and in 2021, we acquired the insurance operations of BGC Partners Inc., a leading global
brokerage and financial technology company. Most recently, in 2023, we acquired Lloyd’s broker
Oxford Insurance Group, which operates across several specialist sectors including professional
indemnity, property, general liability, marine and energy, strengthening the growth potential of our
Specialty Broking platform.

The Specialty Broking platform also includes our Ardonagh Portfolio Solutions (“APS”) business,
which leverages the scale of the Group and optimizes our product development and capacity placement
strategy. APS is built on data captured from across Group’s platforms and businesses, creating
connectivity between segments and developing a “single view” of clients. APS centrally co-ordinates
the most appropriate placement of premiums to drive better solutions for our clients and capital
providers, enabling us to further monetize our scale. This includes the development of a number of
market-leading facilities across the terrorism and professional indemnity classes. These facilities
improve terms, pricing and quality of service to customers, consolidate multiple markets and carriers
and utilize the size, scale and diversification of a portfolio of risks.

**_Retail_**

The Retail platform operates as a digitally focused broker with price comparison websites (“PCW”)
and direct channels, offering a range of specialized home, car, and specialist products such as bike
(including products focused on particular customer categories or risk types within these segments such
as caravan or van insurance) insurance products to individuals and small businesses via a portfolio of
leading brands and leveraging on our back-office scale. Retail utilizes a data-led distribution strategy
focused on online channels, including PCW, complemented by traditional call center support, as well
as through third party intermediaries consisting of mainly independent financial advisors and mortgage
brokers. As part of the Retail platform we operate several retail-facing insurance brands, including
Autonet Insurance Group, Carole Nash, Paymentshield, Marmalade, Swinton Group, Lloyd Latchford
Group, Healthy Pets and Be Wiser Insurance.

In September 2023, we announced the merger and disposal of the Retail platform with the Markerstudy
Group, with our shareholders maintaining a stake in the combined business. The transaction values
Atlanta at £1.2 billion. The Retail Transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory
approvals. As a result of this merger and the resulting disposal of the Retail platform, in our Unaudited
Interim Financial Statements we have presented Retail as held for sale on our consolidated statement of
financial position as of September 30, 2023 and as a discontinued operation on our consolidated
statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income for the nine months period ended September
30, 2023 and the period ended September 30, 2022. See “Summary—Recent Developments—Retail
_Transaction.”_

145


-----

**_Corporate_**

We maintain a non-operating segment comprising central costs and income not allocated to our
reporting segments. These costs include Group board costs and Group function costs, including certain
legal and regulatory expenses. Income in this non-operating segment primarily relates to interest
income. For the twelve months ended September 30, 2023, Corporate generated £28.8 million of Total
Pro Forma Income and £1.8 million of Total Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA.

**Information Technology**

We make significant investments into our technology platform to make it scalable and resilient. We
have retained specialist IT services provider Mphasis to deliver tailored infrastructure services across
various parts of The Ardonagh Group and are in the process of transitioning to cloud-based data centers
and a cloud-based core finance platform, which we believe will contribute to ongoing operating
efficiencies across our businesses. We also utilize Microsoft’s Azure cloud platform across several
applications. Our business benefits from what we believe to be a market leading and scalable technology
platform that can be leveraged across The Ardonagh Group, allowing us to process data more securely,
with lower error rates and at lower cost. Investments into our technology platform have also made it
easier to integrate new acquisitions at low cost and with low integration risk. Such technical capabilities
have also made us an attractive partner to third parties operating in our industry.

The following chart shows our centralized data analytics structure, under which we have centralized
global premium and carrier information using our data center based in Mullingar, Ireland:

We assign high priority to cyber security and have appointed a Chief Information Security Officer (the
“CISO”), who is supported in their activities by a dedicated information security team. The CISO’s
team is an independent risk and control team which ensures that our divisions maintain our desired
information security standards. As a result of our cyber security precautions, we have been able to obtain
insurance that provides coverage in the event of a cyber-attack.

**Intellectual Property**

We believe each of our underlying businesses’ trademarks and major service and product brands
enhance our competitive advantage and are essential to our business. Our businesses, in particular those
that are customer-facing and those with historic name recognition, have developed brand named
products and entities that we believe help attract and retain our customer base. We actively take steps

146


-----

to protect our intellectual property rights when and where we deem appropriate by relying on copyright
and trademark laws, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions. Many of our businesses
maintain their own trademarks and certain of our businesses market their products under a variety of
trademarks or brands. We have registered internet domain names, which are either used by our
businesses to deliver services and information to our customers or held to protect trading names and
brands that we develop. Although we have contributed to the development of certain of the software
platforms that we license, the proprietary rights in the intellectual property of these software platforms
generally rests with the licensors. We presently have no patents or patent applications pending.

**Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance (“ESG”)**

We strive to be a responsible industry presence seeking to contribute positively to society, industry
developments and the environment. We believe that a responsible approach to our employees, partners,
local communities, the environment and society in general is an essential part of our wider and longerterm success. We are committed to creating value for our stakeholders by embedding ESG
considerations throughout all stages of the insurance process. We have adopted a Sustainability Charter
based on five sustainability pillars. Our Sustainability Charter underpins all our conversations, business
decisions and the culture of our businesses. The five sustainability pillars of our Sustainability Charter
are outlined below.

- _Integrity. We seek to conduct our business in an honest and ethical manner._

- _Innovation. We seek to be proactive and responsive to our evolving client needs._

- _People. We seek to ensure the welfare of our employees and those we work with._

- _Society. We seek to enhance the wellbeing of the communities we serve._

- _Environment. We seek to protect the environment and become net zero._

We believe that we do not have any material environmental compliance costs or environmental
liabilities.

**_Integrity_**

Under the Integrity pillar, we are committed to upholding the highest ethical standards among our
executives, employees and business partners while addressing compliance and ethics risks related to
our business. It is our aim to ultimately cover strategies for ESG risk mitigation, business ethics,
management of the regulatory environment, critical incident risk management and systemic risk
management. Our primary policy for promoting integrity remains the Ardonagh Group Code of
Conduct. We also operate a dedicated, Group-wide Anti-Money Laundering and Anti-Bribery and
Corruption Program. This program includes due diligence on suppliers and vendors, annual training for
all personnel, requisite compliance declarations from all associated persons and comprehensive
whistleblowing arrangements. We have also become a signatory in support of the four principles of the
United Nations Principles for Sustainable Insurance (“UN PSI”). As a result, we are rolling out these
principles throughout our business to align our operations with the UN PSI common framework and
integrate ESG criteria into the wider business and into our stakeholder relationships.

**_Innovation_**

Under the Innovation pillar, we will continue to develop our understanding of our model’s resilience
and the innovation needed within the insurance sector to maintain a leadership position in the industry.
It is our aim to collaborate with partners on product development and lifecycle management aspects as
well as supporting initiatives to better manage the risks surrounding the physical impacts of climate
change, which could have a profound impact on insurability and pricing of certain assets or events,

potentially rendering them uninsurable in the long run. In 2023, the Energy team at Price Forbes
designed and placed an insurance program to cover the construction of North America’s most
technologically advanced re-refiner. The re-refiner will aim to create a sustainable circular model for
oil. This technology is pioneering, and the energy team were pivotal in underpinning the success of the
project through the design of a comprehensive insurance program that de-risked the construction project
for its investors. The ability to aggregate portfolio data is much sought after for brokers and this
represents a firm endorsement of the data-powered strategy built by us. In July 2021 we launched a
Global Data and Risk Management Centre in Ireland. This management center delivers data-driven
insights to our clients worldwide, helping colleagues offer tailored solutions from our offices by
providing a highly diversified range of financial services-related products and services across the full
value chain and will drive innovation in the global financial services market and help further develop
one of the key risk research and development regions in Europe.

**_People_**

Under the People pillar, we continue to develop our employee-related practices, including those related
to their health and safety, and our initiatives relating to engagement, workforce equity, diversity and
inclusion. Fair treatment of our employees and the people we work with is crucial to the future continued
successful development of our business and the retention of highly skilled employees. We invest in
training and development and, following the COVID-19 pandemic, we have focused our efforts on the
mental and physical wellbeing of our employees. We believe in treating all people with respect and
dignity. We strive to create and foster a diverse, supportive, inclusive and understanding environment
in which all individuals can realize their maximum potential. We are committed to employing the best
people to do the best job possible, offering equal opportunities. The diverse capabilities that reside
within our talented workforce fulfil the needs of our industry to provide a high-quality service, and we
have taken a series of measures to encourage the promotion of diversity throughout our workforce and
in senior leadership roles. With respect to engagement, we use a collaboration and communication app
called “Engage” to connect all colleagues across the Group. We also set up an internal communication
called “Radio Ardonagh” to showcase achievements from across the Group and celebrate the successes
of colleagues.

We believe all our people should be able to access high quality learning, development, and engagement
opportunities, so they can realize their potential and enjoy successful and meaningful careers.
Throughout 2023 we have engaged with employees through targeted campaigns that promote subjects
relating to the Group’s well-established ED&I forums and wider colleague base. These have focused
on issues such as mental health awareness, support for communities through Give Back Week, Pride,
International Women’s Day and more. In April 2023, Ardonagh launched its bespoke Carbon Literacy
Training Programme, which was created and developed in-house in collaboration with the Carbon
Literacy Trust. This program aims to educate our employees on the actions they can take to reduce their
carbon footprint and to develop their own business specific projects to create greater climate awareness
at a local business level. The program was accredited by the Carbon Literacy Trust in June 2023 and is
being rolled out across the wider group via the learning and development team and the Sustainability
Champions forum.

We work with hundreds of companies across our supply chain, and expect our suppliers to meet high
standards in areas such as ethical conduct, human rights, workplace standards and the environment. We
have established due diligence processes to help select suppliers who meet these high standards. All our
employees are enrolled in our Group’s Diversity, Equality and Inclusion training module as part of their
annual training plan. We are working on deploying remuneration strategies to address the gender pay
gap.

148


-----

**_Society_**

Under the Society pillar, we aim to cover aspects of our business in relation to human rights and
community relations, customer privacy, data security, access and affordability, and selling practices and
product labelling. Treating customers fairly and looking after vulnerable customers have been industrywide priorities, particularly as millions of customers have tipped into ‘low financial resilience’. Poor
numeracy skills are seen as a big driver for these difficulties. Research, published in July 2021, found
that Plain Number versions of the same customer insurance documents, such as explanations of excess
or premium finance costs, doubled levels of understanding on average. Across five trials, customers
seeing the Plain Numbers versions were nearly twice as likely to be able to answer four out of five
comprehension questions correctly, thereby enabling them to make better decisions.

**_Environment_**

We are looking to play a more critical role in combating the climate crisis by better understanding,
managing and monitoring our greenhouse gas emissions, energy and water use as well as our waste and
ecological impact. We recognize that we have a responsibility to the environment and we endeavor to
be as environmentally friendly as possible in our business activities. We are committed to becoming net
zero and have developed a comprehensive environmental management program to guide our efforts in
our UK businesses. We continue to manage our waste and use of natural resources, and our consumption
of renewable energy is monitored. The below chart shows a breakdown of our greenhouse gas emissions
from UK operations in 2021 and 2022.

**Greenhouse Gas Emissions from UK Operations**

**For the twelve months ended December 31,**
**2022** **2021**
**_Tons CO2 emissions_** **_Tons CO2 emissions_**

Scope 1: natural gas for all UK operations only ...... 318 465

& hotel) and electricity transmission & distribution 4,260 943

6,629 3,088
Total emissions for scope 1, 2 & 3 for the year .......

**Ardonagh Community Trust**

We believe it is important to support the communities that we live and work in. This belief led us to
establish the Ardonagh Community Trust (“ACT”) in 2018, a registered charity through which we
implement our community-focused charitable activities. To date, employees raised over £700,000 for
significant causes and ACT matched the effort with an additional £270,000, helping over 600 different
charities. Since its establishment, ACT has raised £5.5 million. Through a quarterly grant program, our
employees can also each access financial support of up to £5,000 for charitable causes and community
projects. In 2023, £66,000 was awarded in grants, helping 14 charities worldwide. Employees receive
one paid day a year to volunteer and support a charity or community project. We have also partnered
with leading mental health charities such as Mind, as well as Samaritans, which provides listening
services across the UK and Ireland for suicide prevention. Over £320,000 was raised for these two
partnerships. In 2024, ACT aims to partner with Médecins Sans Frontières, a global humanitarian
charity providing medical care around the world. We consider ACT to be one of our proudest
achievements, and we continue to be passionate about the communities we live and work in and believe
in the importance of supporting them in becoming stronger, better and brighter.

**Real Estate**

We lease office space in various locations throughout the world in countries where we have operations,
including in Australia, Austria Bermuda, Brazil, Chile, Dubai, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, Ireland,
Italy, Jersey, Malaysia, Portugal, Peru, Singapore, South Africa, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, the
Netherlands and the United States.

Each of our businesses has historically managed its respective property portfolios internally, supported
by our central resources and external specialists where appropriate. These internal property teams are
responsible for ensuring that each site is in compliance with any relevant statutory requirements,
including health and safety requirements as well as disposition of surplus property.

**Insurance**

Our underlying businesses are subject to various actual and potential claims, lawsuits and other
proceedings relating principally to alleged errors and omissions in connection with the placement of
insurance in the ordinary course of business. We believe that each of our underlying businesses has
adequate insurance coverage against all material risks that are typically insured by similar companies
with comparable risk exposure. Insurance cover is regularly reviewed and adjusted when necessary;
however, one or more of our underlying businesses may incur losses that are not covered by existing
policies or that exceed the coverage levels stipulated in the applicable insurance policies.

**Regulation**

UK-domiciled trading entities within our Group are authorized and regulated by the FCA to carry on
insurance broking and other insurance mediation activities in the United Kingdom pursuant to FSMA
and its related statutory instruments.

Our insurance mediation activities must comply with the FCA Rules and guidelines that impose,
amongst other things, a high-level standard on the establishment and maintenance of proper systems
and controls and minimum threshold conditions that must be satisfied for an insurance broking firm to
remain authorized. The FCA Rules impose certain minimum capital and liquidity requirements on firms
as well as an ongoing obligation to regularly provide the FCA with certain information. The FCA has
extensive investigative and disciplinary powers. In addition, individuals performing various ‘Senior
Management’ functions are required to be approved by the FCA. A number of senior management
personnel located within our regulated entities are approved and are required to satisfy certain fitness
and propriety criteria. The FCA maintains an active supervision of the Group, via a dedicated
supervisor, to assess our compliance with regulatory requirements. This also allows us to work closely
with the FCA to address areas of potential regulatory scrutiny.

The FCA plays a critical role in the insurance intermediary industry and is an important stakeholder for
our Group. The FCA has been appraised of the development of our Group from the outset of its
conception by our management team. We have engaged with the FCA with full transparency and acted
swiftly and appropriately when required, and will continue to do so in connection with the future
development of our Group.

This track record of working with the FCA is demonstrated by the resolution of historic regulatory
concerns. Some of our businesses have temporarily failed to meet regulatory expectations in the past,
including those concerning governance and control frameworks and client money. Some of these
previous failings were referenced in change of control approvals when the Group acquired these

151


-----

businesses, and the Group has implemented structured remediation plans to address these failings to the
FCA’s satisfaction.

For example, the FCA concluded that the previous Towergate Group had significant failings in respect
of its governance arrangements, business model, financial stability and with elements of its operational
and client money controls which needed to be strengthened. For these reasons, the FCA had put the
Group on its ‘Watchlist’, denoting a high regulatory risk profile. The management of the Group has
worked closely with the FCA to resolve these concerns over time, including overhauling risk,
compliance and governance arrangements. During this remediation process (at the end of 2018), our
Group acquired Swinton, which was also on the FCA Watchlist. We therefore extended our regulatory
remediation plans to address the risks that applied to Swinton (which also included governance and risk
management concerns). In January 2020, the FCA confirmed it was satisfied with the remediation of
all Watchlist items, including those applying to the previous Towergate and Swinton businesses, and
therefore removed the Group’s businesses from its Watchlist. Since then, the Group has continued to
work with its FCA supervisor to provide assurance over the effective management of UK regulatory
change and demonstrate it has addressed any industry-wide concerns or matters of note.

Our board and executive team continue to work closely with the FCA to demonstrate ongoing progress
in regulated areas in which previous control weaknesses were identified. Since the formation of the
Group, and following subsequent acquisitions, we have extended consistent control and governance
improvements across the whole Group, regularly updating the FCA and meeting the timescales we
communicated for such integration.

The Paymentshield business has sold and continues to sell mortgage payment protection insurance
(“MPPI”) which has been the subject of industry-wide scrutiny by the FCA and the Competition and
Markets Authority (“CMA”). Paymentshield’s products are not analogous to the payment protection
insurance products that have attracted the most FCA scrutiny. Paymentshield’s MPPI has no
cancellation fees and proportionate refunds are offered, and premiums are payable monthly and are not
capitalized upfront as part of the principal amount of the customer’s loan. Therefore, the FCA excluded
Paymentshield from its 2017 Policy Statement “PS17/3 Payment protection insurance complaints:
feedback on CP16/20 and final rules and guidance,” as its products were not in scope for this industry
inquiry which led to significant customer redress for higher risk products. In addition, Paymentshield
policies are distributed by third-party regulated brokers responsible for the sales processes, so any misselling complaints would likely relate to the third-party brokers rather than Paymentshield.

We maintain diverse but individually smaller operations outside of the UK, including several trading
entities in the following EU member states: the Republic of Ireland, the Netherlands, Switzerland,
Austria, Portugal and Greece. A number of these businesses have a similar regulatory profile to the UK
businesses within the Group, and the Group has significant experience in respect of the regulations that
apply to these operations given that shared legislation (which previously applied in the UK prior to it
formally separating from the EU on December 31, 2020) such as the EU Insurance Distribution
Directive (IDD) and data protection regulation have a common EU source. We also maintain
subsidiaries in Australia, South Africa, Bermuda, Dubai, Brazil, Malaysia and the United States, among
others, and part of a joint venture in Hong Kong. In each case, local management have established
practices which comply with local regulatory requirements and all businesses adhere to the Group’s
overall governance and risk management frameworks, which have been updated to allow for the
increased diversity of the Group. We have received no material regulatory scrutiny on non-UK
operations but have proactively engaged with some regulators in more material territories, including
presenting our plans and governance arrangements to the Central Bank of Ireland.

Changes to the UK regulatory framework are likely in the near term as a result of the Financial Services
and Markets Act 2023 (the “2023 Act”), which received Royal Assent on June 29, 2023. Although
certain provisions came into force on that date, the UK Government is taking a phased approach to its
implementation and other provisions will come into force on days to be appointed (unless already

152


-----

specified). The 2023 Act permits the revocation of all retained EU law relating to financial services,
including the Insurance Distribution Directive, although such revocation will only take effect once
regulators have drafted and consulted on replacement rules and are ready to enforce them.

Other changes implemented by the 2023 Act include: (a) a new statutory objective for the FCA requiring
the regulator to act in a way which facilitates the long-term growth and international competitiveness
of the UK economy; and (b) a requirement for the regulator to consider the sustainable growth in the
UK economy in the medium or long term in a manner consistent with the UK’s net zero emissions
commitments.

**Legal Proceedings**

From time to time, we become involved in various actual and potential claims, lawsuits and proceedings
relating principally to alleged errors, omissions or unfair provisions in connection with the placement
of insurance or the provision of financial services advice in the ordinary course of business. As we often
assist customers with matters involving substantial amounts of money, including the placement of
insurance coverage and the handling of related claims and the provision of financial services advice,
errors and omissions claims against us may arise that allege our potential liability for all or part of the
amounts in question. Claimants can seek damages awards that are material for the operation of our
business and these claims can involve potentially significant defense costs. We are currently not
involved in any legal proceedings which, either individually or in the aggregate, are expected to have a
material adverse effect on our reputation, financial position or results of operations. We note, however,
that the outcome of legal proceedings can be extremely difficult to predict, and we offer no assurances
in this regard. See also “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—Our business,
_results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected by the outcome of_
_certain actual and potential claims, lawsuits and other proceedings.”_

**RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS**

In the ordinary course of business activities, we may enter into agreements and transactions with
companies within our group, and related parties may provide lending, advisory or investment services
to the Ardonagh Group from time to time, and may receive customary fees and reimbursement of costs
in respect thereof. All sales to and purchases of services from related parties are conducted on an arm’s
length basis. We believe these agreements are on terms no more favorable to the related parties or our
affiliates and are comparable to those currently contracted with unrelated third-party suppliers and
service providers.

As at September 30, 2023, the Ardonagh Group had related party debtors of £129.1 million and related
party creditors of £8.9 million. Of these balances, Tara Topco Limited accounts for £128.0 million of
the related party debtor balance and all of the related party creditor balance. The balances arise from
transactions where amounts are paid or received by Ardonagh on behalf of Tara Topco Limited. The
majority of the related party debtor from Tara Topco Limited relates to non-current term loans.

Moreover and from time to time, our shareholders, or affiliates thereof, may also buy a portion of the
Notes in the open market or otherwise. In addition, one or more of the shareholders of the Issuer or its
or their respective affiliates may be lenders under the Secured Credit Facilities or provide other lending,
advisory or investment services to the Ardonagh Group from time to time, and may receive customary
fees and reimbursement of costs in respect thereof.

**Management Equity Interests**

In 2022 and 2023, we introduced two new management incentive plan schemes – both schemes are
equity-settled share-based payment schemes. See note 31 of Ardonagh 2022 Financial Statements for

**DESCRIPTION OF OTHER INDEBTEDNESS AND FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS**

_The following is a summary of the material terms of our principal financing arrangements in addition_
_to the Notes after giving effect to the Transactions. The following summaries do not purport to describe_
_all of the applicable terms and conditions of such arrangements and are qualified in their entirety by_
_reference to the actual agreements. The terms of the proposed amendments to the Senior Secured Credit_
_Facilities Agreement described in this section are not final and are subject to change (as described_
_below). Capitalized terms used in the following summaries not otherwise defined in this offering_
_memorandum have the meanings ascribed to them in the respective agreement._

**Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement**

**_Overview and Structure_**

The Company is party to a senior secured credit facilities agreement originally dated June 26, 2020,
with, among others, Ares Management Limited as the mandated lead arranger, sole physical
bookrunner, administrative agent and security agent, the Joint Bookrunners as defined therein and the
Original Lenders thereunder (as most recently amended and restated on 9 January 2023 and as further
amended and/or restated from time to time) (the “Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement”).

The Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement provides for senior secured term loan facilities in
principal amounts equal to €180,000,000 (“Facility B1 (EUR)”), £1,412,837,837.84 (“Facility B1
**(GBP)”), £300,000,000 (“Facility B2”), £164,300,000 (“Facility B3 (GBP)”), $540,000,000**
(“Facility B3 (USD)”), €240,000,000 (“Facility B4”), $365,000,000 (“Facility B5”) and $460,000,000
(“Facility B6”). As of the date hereof, each of the senior secured term loan facilities described in the
foregoing sentence (the “Senior Secured Term Facilities”) has been utilized in full by the Company
as borrower in the currency in which such facility is denominated, other than (i) Facility B3 (GBP) has
been utilized in full in euros in the amount of €187,336,217.87 and (ii) Facility B6 has been utilized
pursuant to loans with principal amounts of $130,000,000 and €145,776,000, and the remainder of the
Facility B6 commitments remain undrawn.

In addition, Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement provides for a super senior multicurrency
revolving credit facility in a principal amount of up to £191.5 million, which is as of the date of this
offering memorandum undrawn (the “Super Senior Revolving Facility” and, together with the Senior
Secured Term Facilities, the “Secured Credit Facilities”).

The Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement also includes (in addition to other permissions under
the limitation on indebtedness covenant) the ability (without double counting against the limitation on
indebtedness covenant) to incur additional indebtedness by way of one or more uncommitted additional
facilities within the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement subject to certain customary conditions,
provided that no such additional term loan facility may be utilized in U.S. dollars or euros unless Facility
B6 has been utilized and/or cancelled in full.

**_Purpose_**

The proceeds of utilizations made under the Facility B1 were applied towards refinancing certain
indebtedness of the Borrower Group outstanding on or about 14 July 2020. The proceeds of utilizations
made under Facility B2, Facility B3, Facility B4 and Facility B5 were used for purposes substantially
similar to those described below in respect of Facility B6 and satisfying transaction costs.

The undrawn Facility B6 commitments may be utilized by the Company and any additional borrower
incorporated in the United Kingdom and tax resident in and only in the United Kingdom. The proceeds
of any loan under Facility B6 may be applied in or towards (directly or indirectly) financing or
refinancing any (i) capital expenditure and expenditure in respect of income hires; (ii) permitted
acquisitions, investments (other than investing directly in cash or cash equivalent investments) and/or

161


-----

joint ventures; (iii) operational restructurings and reorganization requirements of the Borrower Group;
(iv) arrangement fees, original issue discount, ticking fees, commitment fees and/or other financing fees
required to be paid in connection with Facility B6; (v) any other purpose contemplated by the Tax
Structure Memorandum; (vi) fees, costs and/or expenses payable in connection with any of the
foregoing; and/or (vii) repayment of any Super Senior Revolving Facility utilizations or other revolving
debt or replacement cash of the Borrower Group or any acquisition target used for the purpose of any
other foregoing, provided that to the extent that such amounts refinance capital expenditure or permitted
acquisitions, investments and/or joint ventures and/or operational restructurings and reorganization
requirements of the Borrower Group originally funded from other sources pursuant paragraphs (i)
and/or (ii) and/or (iii) above, such refinancing must take place within six (6) months thereof and such
amounts shall not be used to fund working capital requirements, increase cash held by a member of the
Borrower Group (subject to certain exceptions) or to fund an investment in cash equivalent investments.
Facility B6 may be utilized in U.S. dollars, euros (provided that not greater than 50% of the
commitments under Facility B6 may be utilized in euros).

The Super Senior Revolving Facility may be utilized by the Company and any additional borrower
incorporated in the United Kingdom (or any jurisdiction or political sub-division thereof), Ireland,
Delaware or New York or any other jurisdiction approved by all the lenders under the Super Senior
Revolving Facility (acting reasonably). The Super Senior Revolving Facility may be applied in or
towards (directly or indirectly): (i) financing or refinancing the general corporate purposes and/or

**_Availability_**

Each of the Senior Secured Term Facilities (other than Facility B6) has been utilized in full prior to the
date hereof.

Facility B6 was originally available for the period from (and including) 23 June 2023 to 23 December
2023. Pursuant to an amendment letter dated 24 November 2023, the availability period in respect of
the Facility B6 commitments which remained undrawn at such times was extended to end on 31 March
2024. The remaining Facility B6 commitments are only be available to be utilized if (pro forma for such
utilization and the application of the proceeds thereof) the Consolidated Senior Net Leverage Ratio (as
defined below) on the applicable date of determination does not exceed 6.50:1.

The Super Senior Revolving Facility will be available for the period from (and including) 14 July 2020
to (and including) the maturity date of the Super Senior Revolving Facility, being 14 January 2026.

**_Conditions Precedent_**

**_Interest and Fees_**

Loans under the Secured Credit Facilities will initially bear cash interest at rates per annum equal to
EURIBOR for loans denominated in euro, CDOR for loans denominated in Canadian dollars, Daily
Compounded SONIA for loans denominated in sterling and Term SOFR for loans denominated in U.S.
dollars (in each case subject to agreed benchmark rate floors), plus an applicable margin and in respect
of loans denominated in sterling and U.S. dollars certain credit adjustment spread. In the case of the
Senior Secured Term Facilities, the applicable margin will be subject to a margin ratchet based on the
ratio of consolidated net debt to consolidated pro forma EBITDA (“Consolidated Net Leverage

162


-----

**Ratio”) but excluding from consolidated net debt any indebtedness which constitutes Topco Liabilities**
(as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) (or the proceeds thereof) (“Consolidated Senior Net
**Leverage Ratio”). In the case of the Super Senior Revolving Facility, the applicable margin will be**
subject to a margin ratchet based on the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio but excluding from
consolidated net debt any indebtedness which is not Senior Secured Indebtedness or Super Senior
Indebtedness (as defined in the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement) (“Consolidated Senior
**Secured Net Leverage Ratio”).**

The Company was permitted (in its sole discretion) to elect that up to 27.5% of the margin payable on
any Facility B1 Loan or Facility B2 Loan on the last day of any interest period commencing prior to 19
August 2021 be capitalized at the percentage rate per annum determined in accordance with the margin
ratchet described above for the applicable Senior Secured Term Facility loan plus 0.75% per annum on
the last day of the applicable interest period and thereafter treated as part of the principal amount of the
applicable loan. The Company exercised this option to capitalize certain interest payable on certain of
the Senior Secured Term Facility loans prior to such date.

A commitment fee will be payable on the aggregate undrawn and uncancelled amount of Facility B6
and the Super Senior Revolving Facility during the availability period applicable to Facility B6 or the
Super Senior Revolving Facility (as applicable) at a rate of 30% of the applicable margin for Facility
B6 or the Super Senior Revolving Facility (as applicable). Commitment fees will be payable quarterly
in arrears (unless otherwise elected by the Company), on the last day of the availability period applicable
to the relevant facility and, if cancelled, on the cancelled amount of the relevant lender’s commitment
at the time the cancellation is effective.

Default interest will be calculated as an additional 1% on the defaulted amount.

under the Super Senior Revolving Facility are required to be repaid on the maturity date of the Super
Senior Revolving Facility, being January 14, 2026. Amounts repaid by the borrowers on loans made
under the Super Senior Revolving Facility may be reborrowed, subject to certain conditions.

The Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement permits voluntary prepayments to be made. The call
protection periods applicable to the Senior Secured Term Facilities have expired, such that the Secured
Credit Facilities may be voluntarily prepaid at par plus accrued interest and (in the respect of loans
which bear interest by reference to term rates, other than Term SOFR) customary break costs when
prepayment is made other than on the last day of an interest period.

Agreement) or a sale of all or substantially all the businesses and assets of the Borrower Group, each
lender shall be entitled to require prepayment of its commitments within a prescribed time period. A
change of control shall include:

- at any time prior to a Listing, the initial investors cease (directly or indirectly) to (i) have the
power (whether by way of ownership of shares, proxy, contract, agency or otherwise) to appoint
directors or other equivalent officers of the Company which control the majority of the votes
which may be cast at a meeting of the board of directors of the Company or (ii) own and control

163


-----

(whether by way of ownership of shares, proxy, contract, agency or otherwise) more than fifty
per cent. (50%) of the issued voting share capital of the Company or (iii) have the ability to
appoint directors which control the majority of the votes of the board of directors (or equivalent
body) of the Company;

- upon and at any time after a Listing, (i) the initial investors cease (directly or indirectly) to
beneficially own and control (whether by way of ownership of shares, proxy, contract, agency
or otherwise) more than thirty per cent. (30%) of the issued voting share capital of the Company
or (ii) any person (other than the Initial Investors) or persons acting in concert (other than with
any Sponsor Affiliate) (A) owns (directly or indirectly) or controls more voting rights in the
Company than the Initial Investors; or (B) gains the ability to appoint directors of the Company
and as a result gains control over the majority of votes on the board of directors (or equivalent
body) of the Company; or

- Ardonagh Midco 2 ceases to directly own and control all of the issued share capital of the
Company.

The Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement will require mandatory prepayment in full or in part in
certain circumstances, including:

- on an initial public offering which does not constitute a change of control (with the percentage
of proceeds to be prepaid subject to Consolidated Senior Net Leverage Ratio); and

- from certain net cash proceeds received by the Borrower Group from certain asset disposals
and insurance claims, to the extent not otherwise applied for a permitted purpose and required
to be applied in prepayment of the Secured Credit Facilities and subject to a de minimis amount
(with the percentage of proceeds to be prepaid subject to Consolidated Senior Net Leverage
Ratio).

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the intra-group liabilities owed by one member of the Senior
Secured Group to another member of the Senior Secured Group (other than any Senior Secured Notes

Management Facility Liabilities, Hedging Liabilities, Second Lien Lender Liabilities and Second Lien
Notes Liabilities, Agent Liabilities and Topco Notes Liabilities and to any arranger in connection with

The Intercreditor Agreement also provides that the liabilities owed by any member of the Senior
Secured Group (other than any Topco Proceeds Loan Liabilities) to a holding company of the Company
or to any other person, in each case, who becomes a subordinated creditor (a “Subordinated Creditor”)
under the Intercreditor Agreement (the “Subordinated Liabilities”) will be subordinated to the
liabilities owed by the Debtors and Third Party Security Providers to the Secured Parties and to the
Intra-Group Liabilities.

No security (other than pursuant to the secured documents relating to Topco Independent Transaction
Security or Topco Shared Security or as described above) shall be granted by a member of the Senior

**_New Debt Financing_**

The Intercreditor Agreement provides, subject to certain conditions, for the implementation of existing,
additional, supplemental or new financing arrangements that will constitute, for the purposes of the
Intercreditor Agreement, Senior Lender Liabilities, Senior Secured Notes Liabilities, Cash Management
Facility Liabilities, Hedging Liabilities, Second Lien Liabilities, Topco Liabilities, Super Senior
Liabilities or Hedging Liabilities (each a “New Debt Financing”). The conditions include certification
by the Company that such New Debt Financing is permitted under the terms of the Finance Documents.

Such financing arrangements may be implemented by way of refinancing, replacement, exchange, setoff, discharge or increase of any such new, existing, additional, supplemental financing arrangement
under the relevant finance documents. In connection with and in order to facilitate any New Debt
Financing, each agent in respect of any Priority Secured Liabilities and the applicable Security Agent
(and each other person party to a Transaction Security document or a Topco Independent Transaction
Security document) is authorized and instructed to promptly enter into any new security document,
amend or waive any term of an existing security document and/or release any asset from the Transaction
Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security (as the case may be) and/or to effect the ranking,
priority, guarantees and security of the New Debt Financing subject to certain conditions, including that
any such new security in relation to such New Debt Financing shall be, unless otherwise required by
the Company, on terms substantially the same (except that it shall also secure any New Debt Financing)
as the terms applicable to the existing Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security
over equivalent assets.

Where any indebtedness (“Permitted Acquired Indebtedness”) which is not prohibited under the
Finance Documents is incurred by or in connection with the acquisition of (i) a person or any of its
subsidiaries who, after the Closing Date, becomes a Restricted Subsidiary or merges, consolidates or is
otherwise combined with a Restricted Subsidiary, or (ii) in relation to an asset of or shares (or other
ownership interests) in any such person or which is otherwise acquired after the Closing Date (together
an “Acquired Person or Asset”), any security, guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss in
respect of such New Debt Financing which is subsisting at the date when the conditions to the incurrence
of such New Debt Financing set out in the Intercreditor Agreement have been satisfied (or is to be
granted thereafter, including subject to any condition or periodic testing) shall be permitted to subsist
and there is no requirement to offer that security, guarantee, indemnity or other assurance in respect of
any other liabilities under any Debt Document. No security, guarantee, indemnity or other assurance
against loss is required to be given by any member of the Topco Group in respect of any liabilities
(including under any Debt Document) (i) over any Acquired Person or Asset if this would breach a
contractual undertaking applicable to the Topco Group or is excluded or exempt from being given under
the Agreed Security Principles (as defined in the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement), (ii) over
any asset required (including subject to any condition) to provide credit support in relation to any
Permitted Acquired Indebtedness (other than as a result of any obligation to extend any Transaction
Security rateably for the benefit of such Permitted Acquired Indebtedness), or (iii) where the grant of
such security, guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss is prevented by the documentation
in relation to such Permitted Acquired Indebtedness or would give rise to an obligation (including any
payment obligation but not including any obligation to extend any Transaction Security rateably for the
benefit of such Permitted Acquired Indebtedness) under or in relation thereto.

creditors in respect thereof being the “Senior Secured Creditors”) at any time, provided that following
certain acceleration events under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement or any Permitted
Senior Secured Facilities Agreement or Senior Secured Indenture or Permitted Super Senior Secured
Facilities Agreement or following an Insolvency Event (as defined below), payments may only be made
by Debtors or Third Party Security Providers and received by creditors in accordance with the
provisions described below under _“—Application of Proceeds” provided that there shall be no_
obligation to turnover any such payments received, other than those related to an enforcement of
Transaction Security or a Distressed Disposal (as defined below) of assets subject to the Transaction
Security.

Any failure to make a payment in accordance with the Senior Secured Finance Documents following
an acceleration event as required by the ICA shall not prevent the occurrence of an event of default
under such applicable Senior Secured Finance Documents.

_Permitted Payments in Respect of the Second Lien Debt_

Prior to the first date on which all of the Senior Liabilities, the Super Senior Liabilities and the Senior
Secured Notes Liabilities (together, the “Senior Secured Liabilities” and together with the Second Lien
Liabilities and Topco Liabilities being the “Secured Liabilities”) have been discharged (the “Senior
Secured Discharge Date”), the Company, the members of the Senior Secured Group and Third Party
Security Providers may only make specified scheduled payments in respect of the Second Lien
Liabilities, in accordance with the finance documents governing such Second Lien Liabilities, subject
to compliance with certain conditions in the Intercreditor Agreement.

The principal conditions are that the relevant payment (if it is a payment of principal or capitalized
interest) is not prohibited by any prior ranking financing agreement, including any Permitted Super
Senior Secured Facilities Agreement, Permitted Senior Secured Facilities Agreement and any Senior
Secured Indenture (or if it is so prohibited, that all necessary consents have been obtained to permit it),
no payment stop notice has been issued to the agent or trustee for the relevant Second Lien Liabilities
and no Senior Secured Payment Default (as defined below) has occurred and is continuing.

Certain specified payments in respect of Second Lien Liabilities are also permitted at all times,
notwithstanding that a payment stop notice is outstanding or such a payment default is continuing. These
payments and basket amounts are substantially similar to those referenced for Topco Liabilities in (ii) of
the next paragraph.

_Permitted Payments in Respect of Topco Liabilities_

Prior to the date which is the later of the Senior Secured Discharge Date and the first date (the “Second
Lien Discharge Date”) on which all Second Lien Liabilities have been discharged (the “Priority
Discharge Date”), the Company, the members of the Senior Secured Group, the Topco Borrowers and
Third Party Security Providers may only make specified scheduled payments to the Topco Creditors or
any Topco Borrower (in respect of the Topco Liabilities) or a Topco Investor (in respect of any Topco
Proceeds Loan Liabilities only) (together, the “Topco Group Liabilities”) (such payments, collectively,
“Permitted Topco Payments”):

(i) if:

(A) no Topco Payment Stop Notice (as defined below) is outstanding;

176


-----

(B) no payment default (subject to a de minimis threshold in the case of amounts other than
principal, interest or certain fees) has occurred and is continuing under any Permitted
Senior Secured Facilities Agreement, Permitted Super Senior Secured Facilities
Agreement, Cash Management Facility document or Senior Secured Notes document (a
“Senior Secured Payment Default”), or under the Second Lien Facilities or Second Lien
Notes (a “Second Lien Payment Default”); and

(C) the payment is of (1) any amount of principal or capitalized interest in respect of the Topco
Liabilities which is (x) not prohibited by any prior ranking financing agreements (in respect
of the Senior Secured Liabilities and the Second Lien Liabilities), or any required consents
to permit such payment have been obtained or (y) required in connection with a NonDistressed Disposal (as defined below) or for claims and other proceeds sought before an
acceleration event has occurred and is continuing or the enforcement of any Transaction
Security pursuant to such acceleration event, (2) any other amount which is not an amount
of principal or capitalized interest (such other amounts including all scheduled interest
payments (including, if applicable, special interest or liquidated damages) the accrual of
cash interest otherwise payable during a period when a Topco Payment Stop Notice is
outstanding and default interest on the Topco Liabilities accrued and payable in accordance
with the terms of the relevant Topco Finance Document (as at the date of the issue of the
same or as amended in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and the
other Debt Documents), additional amounts payable as a result of the tax gross-up
provisions relating to the Topco Liabilities and amounts in respect of currency indemnities
in any Topco Finance Document), (3) made in pursuance of a debt buy-back program
approved by the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, Majority Super Senior Creditors and
Majority Second Lien Creditors (each as defined below), or (4) amounts due under any
syndication strategy letter relating to the Topco Finance Documents;

(ii) if, notwithstanding that a Topco Payment Stop Notice (as defined below) is outstanding and/or
(other than in respect of paragraph (N) below) a Senior Secured Payment Default and/or a Second
Lien Payment Default has occurred and is continuing and (if the Topco Borrower is a guarantor
or borrower under any prior ranking debt facilities at such time, other than in respect of paragraph
(L) below) irrespective of whether any creditors under prior ranking debt facilities have
accelerated their debt, the payment is not prohibited to be made at such time by any prior ranking
financing agreements (in respect of the Senior Secured Liabilities and the Second Lien Liabilities),
or the payment is (without double counting any equivalent applicable basket in any Debt
Document, but whether or not permitted by the Debt Documents): (A) of ongoing fees under any
original fee letter relating to the Topco Finance Documents, (B) of commercially reasonable
advisory and professional fees for restructuring advice and valuations (including legal advice and
the advice of other appropriate financial and/or restructuring advisors) and any fees, costs or
expenses of the relevant Topco Agent (as defined below) not exceeding £1,500,000 in aggregate,

(or their affiliates), (C) of any amounts owed to a Topco Agent (as defined below), (D) of costs
necessary to protect, preserve or enforce security, (E) of any costs, commissions, taxes, premiums,
amendment fees (including any original issue discount and other consent and/or waiver fees) and
any expenses incurred in respect of (or reasonably incidental to) the Topco Finance Documents
(including in relation to any reporting or listing requirements under the Topco Finance
Documents), (F) of any other amount not exceeding £5,000,000 in any financial year of the
Company, provided that any such amount not so applied may be carried forward and utilized in
the subsequent financial year (where it shall be deemed to have been used first) (G) of any amount
of the Topco Liabilities which would have been payable but for the issue of a Topco Payment
Stop Notice (which has since expired and no new Topco Payment Stop Notice is outstanding)
which has been capitalized and added to the principal amount of the Topco Liabilities or where
that amount is outstanding as a result of the accrual of cash interest payable in respect of the Topco
Liabilities during such period or any such amount described at (i)(C) above, provided that no such

177


-----

payment may be made if certain events of default have occurred under the Senior Secured
Liabilities or Second Lien Liabilities or would occur as a result of making such payment, (H) for
as long as an event of default in respect of the Senior Secured Liabilities, Second Lien Liabilities
or Topco Group Liabilities is continuing, all or part of the Topco Liabilities being released or
otherwise discharged solely in consideration for the issues of shares in any holding company of
the Company (a “Debt for Equity Swap”) provided that no cash or cash equivalent payment is
made in respect of the Topco Liabilities, that it does not result in a Change of Control as defined
in any prior ranking finance agreement or Topco Finance Document and that any Liabilities owed
by a member of the Senior Secured Group to another member of the Senior Secured Group, to the
Subordinated Creditors or to any other holding company of the Company that arise as a result of
any such Debt for Equity Swap are subordinated to the Senior Secured Liabilities and Second Lien
Liabilities pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement and the Senior Secured Creditors and Second
Lien Creditors are granted Transaction Security in respect of any of those Intra-Group Liabilities
or Subordinated Liabilities owed by any member of the Senior Secured Group, (I) of non-cash
interest made by way of capitalizing interest or issuing a non cash-pay instrument which is

and other proper and incidental expenses required to maintain existence or any other reasonable
and ordinary course administrative and maintenance costs and expenses of a Topco Borrower or
its affiliates, (K) funded directly or indirectly with the proceeds of Topco Liabilities incurred
under or pursuant to any Topco Finance Documents, (L) if the payment is made by the Topco
Borrower in respect of its obligations under the Topco Finance Documents; and such payment is
not directly or indirectly sourced from a member of the Senior Secured Group or such payment is
funded from proceeds received by the Topco Borrower from the Senior Secured Group without
breaching the terms of the Debt Documents, (M) if the payment is of a principal amount of the
Topco Liabilities and made in accordance with a provision in a Topco Finance Document relating
to prepayment upon illegality or any other provision that permits the repayment in full of the
participation of any single Topco Creditor in the event of a tax gross-up, increased costs or other
indemnity becoming payable and (N) if no Senior Secured Payment Default or Second Lien
Payment Default has occurred and is continuing and the payment is a payment of principal, interest
or any other amounts made on or after the final maturity date of the relevant Topco Liabilities
(provided that such maturity date is no earlier than that contained in the original form of the
relevant Topco Finance Document as of the date of first issuance or borrowing (as the case may
be) of the applicable Topco Liabilities); or

(iii) if the requisite Senior Secured Creditors, Super Senior Creditors and Second Lien Creditors give
prior consent to that payment being made.

A reference in the section above to a payment shall be construed to include any other direct or indirect
step, matter, action or dealing in relation to any Topco Liabilities which are otherwise prohibited under
the Intercreditor Agreement.

On or after the Priority Discharge Date, the Debtors, the Topco Borrowers and the Third Party Security
Providers may make payments in respect of the Topco Group Liabilities in accordance with the Topco
Finance Documents and the Topco Proceeds Loan Agreement (as applicable).

_Topco Liabilities Payment Block Provisions_

A Topco Payment Stop Notice (as defined below) is outstanding from the date falling one Business Day
after the date on which, following the occurrence of an event of default under any Senior Secured
Liabilities (a “Senior Secured Event of Default”) or an event of default under the Second Lien
Liabilities (a “Second Lien Event of Default”), the Priority Security Agent (acting on the instructions
of the requisite Super Senior Creditors, Senior Secured Creditors or Second Lien Creditors gave the
instructions for the relevant stop notice to be delivered) (a “Topco Payment Stop Notice”) to the agent
under any Topco Facility (the “Topco Agent”) and the trustee under any Topco Notes (including the

178


-----

Senior Notes Trustee) (the “Topco Notes Trustee”) advising that the Senior Secured Event of Default
or Second Lien Event of Default is continuing and suspending payments by the Senior Secured Group
of the Topco Liabilities, until the first to occur of:

(i) the date falling one hundred and seventy nine (179) days after delivery of that Topco Payment
Stop Notice;

(ii) the date on which a default occurs for failure to pay principal at the original scheduled maturity
of the relevant Topco Liabilities;

(iii) if a Topco Standstill Period (as defined below) commences after delivery of that Topco Payment
Stop Notice, the date on which such standstill period expires;

(iv) the date on which the relevant Senior Secured Event of Default or Second Lien Event of Default
has been remedied or waived;

(v) the date on which the Priority Security Agent (acting on the instructions of whichever of the
Majority Super Senior Creditors, Majority Senior Secured Creditors or Majority Second Lien
Creditors gave the instructions for the relevant Topco Payment Stop Notice to be delivered)
delivers a notice to the Topco Borrower, the Topco Agent and the Topco Notes Trustee cancelling
the Topco Payment Stop Notice;

(vi) the Priority Discharge Date; and

(vii) the date on which the Topco Creditors take any enforcement action that is permitted under the
Intercreditor Agreement (see “—Permitted Topco Enforcement” below).

No Topco Payment Stop Notice may be delivered by the Priority Security Agent in reliance on a Senior
Secured Event of Default or a Second Lien Event of Default more than forty five (45) days after the
occurrence of the relevant event of default. No more than one Topco Payment Stop Notice may be
served (i) with respect to the same event or set of circumstances, or (ii) in any period of three hundred
and sixty (360) days.

Any failure to make a payment due in respect of the Topco Group Liabilities as a result of the issue of
a Topco Payment Stop Notice or the occurrence of a Senior Secured Payment Default or Second Lien
Payment Default shall not prevent (i) the occurrence of an event of default as a consequence of that
failure to make a payment in relation to the relevant Topco Group Liabilities, or (ii) the issue of an
enforcement notice in respect of an event of default under the finance documents documenting any
Topco Group Liabilities (a “Topco Enforcement Notice”) on behalf of the Topco Creditors.

_Payment Obligations and Capitalization of Interest Continue_

Nothing in the Second Lien or Topco payment block provisions will release any Debtor from the
liability to make any payment (including of default interest, which shall continue to accrue) under the
applicable Debt Documents even if its obligation to make such payment is restricted at any time. The
accrual and capitalization of interest (if any) in accordance with the applicable Debt Documents shall
continue notwithstanding the issue of a payment stop notice.

_Cure of Payment Stop_

If:

(i) at any time following the issue of a Topco Payment Stop Notice or the occurrence of a
Senior Secured Payment Default or Second Lien Payment Default, that Topco Payment
Stop Notice ceases to be outstanding and/or (as the case may be) the Senior Secured
Payment Default or Second Lien Payment Default ceases to be continuing; and

179


-----

(ii) the relevant Debtor or Topco Borrower then promptly pays to the Topco Creditors or any
party that has acceded to the Intercreditor Agreement as a creditor under a Topco Proceeds
Loan (the “Topco Investors”) (in respect of the Topco Proceeds Loan Liabilities only) an
amount equal to any payments which had accrued under the Topco Finance Documents or
the Topco Proceeds Loan Agreement (as applicable) and which would have been Permitted
Topco Payments but for that Topco Payment Stop Notice or Senior Secured Payment
Default or Second Lien Payment Default (as the case may be), then any event of default
which may have occurred under a Topco Finance Document or Topco Proceeds Loan
Agreement and any Topco Enforcement Notice which may have been issued as a result of
that suspension of payments shall be waived without any further action being required.

**_Turnover_**

Subject to certain exceptions, the Intercreditor Agreement will provide that if, at any time prior to the
latest to occur of the Super Senior Discharge Date (as defined below), the Senior Secured Discharge
Date, the Second Lien Discharge Date and the first date on which all of the Topco Liabilities have been
fully discharged (the “Topco Discharge Date”) (the “Final Discharge Date”) any creditor (other than
a Senior Secured Creditor) receives or recovers from any Debtor, member of the Senior Secured Group
or Third Party Security Provider:

(i) any payment or distribution of, or on account of or in relation to, any of the liabilities owed to the

(ii) any amount by way of set-off which does not give effect to a payment permitted under the
Intercreditor Agreement;

litigation or proceedings against a Debtor, member of the Senior Secured Group or any
Third Party Security Provider (other than after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event); or

(B) by way of set-off in respect of any of the liabilities owed to it after the occurrence of an
acceleration event or the enforcement of any Transaction Security as a result of such an
acceleration event,

other than, in each case, any amount received or recovered in accordance with the provisions set out
below under “Application of Proceeds”;

(iv) the proceeds of any enforcement of any of the Transaction Security except in accordance with the
provisions set out below under “Application of Proceeds”; or

(v) any distribution in cash or in kind or payment of, or on account of or in relation to, any of the

respect of that Debtor, member of the Senior Secured Group or Third Party Security Provider,

that creditor will:

(i) in relation to receipts and recoveries not received or recovered by way of set-off (x) hold an
amount of that receipt or recovery equal to the relevant liabilities (or if less, the amount received

180


-----

the Priority Security Agent or the Topco Security Agent (as applicable) for application in
accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, and (y) promptly pay or distribute an

(ii) in relation to receipts and recoveries received or recovered by way of set-off, promptly pay an
amount equal to that recovery to the Priority Security Agent or the Topco Security Agent (as

A turnover mechanism on substantially the same terms applies in the event that, at any time prior to the
Final Discharge Date, any Senior Secured Creditor receives or recovers from any Debtor, any member
of the Senior Secured Group or Third Party Security Provider (x) any proceeds from the enforcement
of security or from a Distressed Disposal (as defined below) or following an acceleration event or the
enforcement of security, any proceeds arising from any of the charged property or (y) any other amounts
which should otherwise be received or recovered by the Priority Security Agent or the Topco Security
Agent except in accordance with the provisions set out below under “—Application of Proceeds.”

**_Effect of Insolvency Event_**

“Insolvency Event” is defined as, in relation to any Obligor, Material Subsidiary (each as defined in
the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement) or Third Party Security Provider, (a) the passing of any
resolution or making of an order for insolvency, bankruptcy, winding up, dissolution, administration,
examinership or reorganization (excluding solvent reorganizations), (b) a moratorium is declared in
relation to any of its indebtedness, (c) the appointment of a liquidator, receiver, examiner,
administrative receiver, administrator, compulsory manager or other similar officer in respect of it or
any of its assets, or (d) any analogous procedure or step is taken in any jurisdiction, other than (in each
case), (i) frivolous or vexatious proceedings, (ii) proceedings or appointments which the Priority
Security Agent is satisfied will be withdrawn or unsuccessful or (iii) as permitted under any Senior
Secured Credit Facility Agreement or in any Permitted Senior Secured Facilities Agreement, Permitted
Super Senior Secured Facilities Agreement or a Second Lien Facility Agreement, or otherwise not
constituting a default.

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that, after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event, any party
entitled to receive a distribution out of the assets of an Obligor, Material Subsidiary or Third Party
Security Provider (in the case of a Senior Secured Creditor, only to the extent such amounts constitute
proceeds of enforcement) shall direct the person responsible for the distribution to pay that distribution
to the Priority Security Agent (or in the case of distributions in respect of assets subject to the Topco
Independent Transaction Security only, the Topco Security Agent) until the liabilities owing to the
Secured Parties have been paid in full. The Priority Security Agent and the Topco Security Agent shall
apply all such distributions paid to it in accordance with the provisions set out under “—Application of
_Proceeds” below._

To the extent that any member of the Senior Secured Group or Third Party Security Provider’s liabilities
to creditors are, with certain exceptions, discharged by way of set-off (mandatory or otherwise and in
the case of a Senior Secured Creditor, only to the extent such amounts constitute proceeds of
enforcement) after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event, any creditor benefiting from such set-off
shall pay an amount equal to the amount of the liabilities owed to it which are discharged by that setoff to the Priority Security Agent for application in accordance with the provisions set out under “—
_Application of Proceeds” below._

If any Security Agent or any other Secured Party receives a distribution in a form other than in cash in
respect of any liabilities, the liabilities will not be reduced by that distribution until and except to the
extent that the realization proceeds are actually applied towards such liabilities.

181


-----

Subject to certain netting and set-off rights under ancillary or cash management facilities, after the
occurrence of an Insolvency Event, each creditor irrevocably authorizes the applicable Security Agent
to take Enforcement Action (as defined below), make demands, collect and receive distributions, file
claims and take other actions necessary to make recovery in relation to a Debtor, member of the Senior
Secured Group or Third Party Security Provider. The creditors agree to do all things the applicable
Security Agent reasonably requests in order to give effect to these provisions.

**_Security Enforcement Regime_**

_Enforcement of Security_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the applicable Security Agent may not take any action to
enforce the Transaction Security or the Topco Independent Transaction Security without the prior
written consent of an Instructing Group, Majority Second Lien Creditors or Majority Topco Creditors
(as applicable) otherwise as specified in the provisions described below.

An “Instructing Group” means:

(a) prior to the later of the Senior Secured Discharge Date and the first date on which the Super Senior
Liabilities have been fully and finally discharged (the “Super Senior Discharge Date”), Senior
Secured Creditors (other than the Super Senior Creditors) representing more than 50% of the credit
participations of the Senior Secured Liabilities (other than the Super Senior Liabilities) (the
“Majority Senior Secured Creditors”), save that, for instructions relating to enforcement, it shall
mean the group of Secured Creditors entitled to give instructions in accordance with the
enforcement regime described under “—Enforcement of Transaction Security” below;

(b) on or after the later of the Senior Secured Discharge Date and the Super Senior Discharge Date
but before the Priority Discharge Date, Second Lien Creditors representing more than 50% of the
credit participations of the Second Lien Liabilities (the “Majority Second Lien Creditors”); and

(c) on or after the Priority Discharge Date but before the Topco Discharge Date, Topco Creditors
representing more than 50% of the credit participations of the Topco Liabilities (the “Majority
**Topco Creditors”).**

_Enforcement of Transaction Security_

The Priority Security Agent (and in the case of sub-paragraph (iii) below only, the Topco Security
Agent) may refrain from enforcing the Transaction Security unless instructed otherwise in accordance
with the provisions described in this paragraph. If the Transaction Security has become enforceable, if
either Super Senior Creditors representing more than 50% of the credit participations of the Super
Senior Liabilities (the “Majority Super Senior Creditors”) or the Majority Senior Secured Creditors
wish to issue enforcement instructions their respective representatives (and, if applicable, the hedge
counterparties) shall deliver a copy of those instructions (an “Initial Enforcement Notice”) to the
Priority Security Agent and to the other agents, trustees and hedge counterparties which did not deliver
such Initial Enforcement Notice.

The Priority Security Agent (and in the case of sub-paragraph (iii) below only, the Topco Security
Agent) will act in accordance with any instructions (provided they are consistent with the Enforcement
Principles (as defined below)) received from (i) the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, (ii) if, prior to
the later of the Senior Secured Discharge Date and the Super Senior Discharge Date, the Majority Senior
Secured Creditors or the Majority Super Senior Creditors (as applicable) have not given instructions or
they have instructed the Priority Security Agent not to enforce or cease enforcing and have not required
any Debtor or Third Party Security Provider to make a Distressed Disposal, the Majority Second Lien
Creditors, where the rights of the Second Lien Creditors to enforce have arisen under the Intercreditor
Agreement, provided that such enforcement instructions shall either (A) in relation to assets which are
subject to ongoing Enforcement Action commenced by the Majority Senior Secured Creditors or

182


-----

Majority Super Senior Creditors, follow the same process as such Enforcement Action which was
ongoing and (B) in relation to assets which were not subject to such ongoing Enforcement Action,
ensure that completion of any Enforcement Action commenced by the Majority Second Lien Creditors
shall be subject to and conditional upon (and which are not materially prejudicial to) the completion of
such ongoing Enforcement Action or (iii) if, prior to the Priority Discharge Date, the Majority Senior
Secured Creditors or the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Majority Second Lien Creditors (as
applicable) have not given instructions or they have instructed the Priority Security Agent not to enforce
or cease enforcing and have not required any Debtor or Third Party Security Provider to make a
Distressed Disposal, the Majority Topco Creditors who are then entitled to give such instructions under
the Intercreditor Agreement, provided that such enforcement instructions shall either (A) in relation to
assets which are subject to ongoing Enforcement Action commenced by the Majority Senior Secured
Creditors, Majority Super Senior Creditors or Majority Second Lien Creditors, follow the same process
as such Enforcement Action which was ongoing and (B) in relation to assets which were not subject to
such ongoing Enforcement Action, ensure that completion of any Enforcement Action commenced by
the Majority Topco Creditors shall be subject to and conditional upon (and which are not materially
prejudicial to) the completion of such ongoing Enforcement Action unless such Enforcement Action
relates solely to the Topco Independent Transaction Security and not any Transaction Security.

Notwithstanding the preceding paragraphs, if (a) a Super Senior Material Event of Default (as defined
below) is continuing; (b) a Senior Agent for the applicable Super Senior Creditors (a “Super Senior
**Agent”) has given notice (a “Super Senior Enforcement Notice”) to the Priority Security Agent**
specifying that a Super Senior Material Event of Default has occurred under the Super Senior Finance
Documents in respect of which it is an agent has occurred and is continuing; and (c) a period (a “Super
Senior Standstill Period”) of not less than (i) ninety (90) days in the case of a Super Senior Material
Event of Default specified in paragraph (i) of such definition; or (ii) one hundred and twenty (120) days
in the case of Super Senior Material Event of Default specified in paragraph (iv)(A) of such definition;
or (iii) one hundred and fifty (150) days in the case of any other Super Senior Material Event of Default,
has elapsed from the date on which that Super Senior Enforcement Notice becomes effective or, in
relation to any Super Senior Liabilities, such longer period (if any) as agreed between the Company (in
its discretion) and the Super Senior Agent in relation to such Super Senior Liabilities and notified to the
Priority Security Agent; (d) the relevant Super Senior Material Event of Default is continuing at the end
of the relevant Super Senior Standstill Period; (e) no Secured Creditor has given a legally binding
commitment to acquire all of the Super Senior Liabilities in accordance with the option to purchase of
the Senior Secured Creditors, Second Lien Creditors or Topco Creditors under the Intercreditor
Agreement; (f) the Super Senior Discharge Date has not occurred by that date; or (g) the Majority Super
Senior Creditors have given their prior written consent, in each case provided that if the Priority Security
Agent has given notice to the Super Senior Creditors that it has taken Enforcement Action during a
Super Senior Standstill Period and either (A) the Priority Security Agent has notified the Super Senior
Creditors that it has ceased to take such Enforcement Action or (B) (1) a period of six (6) months has
elapsed from the earlier of (I) the expiry of the relevant Super Senior Standstill Period and (II) the first
date on which Enforcement Action was taken during the relevant Super Senior Standstill Period by the
Priority Security Agent on the instructions of the Majority Senior Secured Creditors (the “Discharge
**Period”) provided that, if the Priority Security Agent (on the instructions of the Majority Senior Secured**
Creditors) has undertaken Material Enforcement Action (as defined below) which is ongoing at the end
of the Discharge Period, the Super Senior Creditors shall not be entitled to become the Instructing Group
and instruct the Priority Security Agent to take or cease taking any Enforcement Action (including any
existing Enforcement Action or Material Enforcement Action) until a further period of sixty (60) days
has elapsed from the last day of the Discharge Period; (2) the relevant Super Senior Material Event of
Default is continuing at such time; (3) no Senior Secured Creditor has given a legally binding
commitment to acquire all of the Super Senior Liabilities within ten (10) days of the date of such legally
binding commitment in accordance with the option to purchase of the Senior Secured Creditors, Second
Lien Creditors or Topco Creditors under the Intercreditor Agreement; and the Super Senior Discharge
Date has not occurred by that date, then the Majority Super Senior Creditors shall be entitled to give
instructions to the Priority Security Agent to enforce the Transaction Security in such manner (including

183


-----

as to the selection of an administrator of any Debtor) as they see fit (subject to the Enforcement
Principles) and the Priority Security Agent will act in accordance with such instructions (but not
instructions to cease or change any Enforcement Action which is ongoing upon the instruction of the
Majority Senior Secured Creditors, though the Majority Super Senior Creditors may take control of
such ongoing Enforcement Action) provided that such enforcement instructions shall either (x) in
relation to assets which are subject to ongoing Enforcement Action commenced by the Majority Senior
Secured Creditors, follow the same process as such Enforcement Action which was ongoing; and (y) in
relation to assets which were not subject to such ongoing Enforcement Action, ensure that completion
of any Enforcement Action commenced by the Majority Super Senior Creditors shall be subject to and
conditional upon (and which are not materially prejudicial to) the completion of such ongoing
Enforcement Action.

“Super Senior Material Event of Default” means an event of default as a result of (i) a payment
default in respect of amounts owed under a super senior facility; (ii) incurrence of super senior
indebtedness which is not permitted indebtedness (iii) an insolvency event in respect of the Company,

classed as a significant subsidiary under a specified limb of the definition thereunder; (iv)(A) a breach
of a financial covenant granted solely the benefit of the applicable Super Senior Creditors or (B) a
failure to deliver information necessary to determine compliance with such financial covenant, in each
case, subject to any grace periods; (v) a breach of the invalidity and unlawfulness or intercreditor
agreement events of default (to the extent it prejudices the right of the applicable Super Senior Creditors
to receive proceeds from an enforcement of the Transaction Security in priority to the other Senior
Secured Creditors); (vi) a breach of the repudiation and rescission of agreements event of default (to
the extent it materially disproportionately prejudices the applicable Super Senior Creditors as compared
with the other Senior Secured Creditors); or (vii) the occurrence of any matter that (or breach of any
provision the waiver of which) requires the consent of the requisite majority of applicable Super Senior
Creditors but in respect of which such consent has not been obtained.

“Material Enforcement Action” means, in respect of any Enforcement Action instructed by the
Majority Senior Secured Creditors, (a) legally binding commitments have been entered into in respect
of a Distressed Disposal and those commitments are only subject to purchaser conditions (including,
payment of any purchase price) that are reasonably likely to result in the discharge in full of the Super
Senior Liabilities; or (b) (i) legally binding commitments have been entered into in respect of a
Distressed Disposal and those commitments are only subject to applicable regulatory review or approval
that are reasonably likely to result in the discharge in full of the Super Senior Liabilities; (ii) the request
for such regulatory review and approval has been submitted during the Discharge Period; and (iii) there
is a reasonable prospect that regulatory approval will be granted for the relevant Distressed Disposal.

Notwithstanding the preceding paragraphs, if at any time the agents or representatives of the Second
Lien Creditors or Topco Creditors then entitled to give any Security Agent instructions do not give such
instruction and do not indicate any intention to give such instruction, then the Majority Senior Secured
Creditors or Majority Super Senior Creditors to the extent that such group is entitled to give enforcement
instructions as described in the paragraph above may give instructions to the Priority Security Agent or
the Topco Security Agent to enforce the Transaction Security as they see fit and the Priority Security
Agent and the Topco Security Agent shall act on such instructions.

carried out by way of a public auction or other competitive sales process, shall (if the Priority Security
Agent is so requested by the Majority Super Senior Creditors or Majority Senior Secured Creditors)
benefit from a fairness opinion from an investment bank, firm of accountants or third party financial

full the Super Senior Liabilities or Senior Secured Liabilities (as applicable) in cash.

_Enforcement—Topco Independent Transaction Security_

Subject to the Topco Independent Transaction Security having become enforceable in accordance with
its terms, an agent or trustee under the Topco Finance Documents (acting on the instructions of the

liabilities transferred to a holding company of the Company specified by such creditor, in which case
the Security Agents are irrevocably authorized (at the cost of the relevant Debtor or the Company and
without any consent, sanction, authority or further confirmation from any creditor or Debtor) to execute
such documents as are required to so transfer those borrowing, guarantee or other liabilities.

provision), any creditor fails to respond to the request within ten (10) Business Days (or any other period
of time notified by the Company, with the agreement of each of the agents or trustee in the case of a

_Provisions Following an IPO_

On or following an initial public offering of a member of the Senior Secured Group (or a holding

Documents will automatically operate so that, amongst other things, (i) the Senior Secured Group (and
all related provisions) will now refer to the member of the Senior Secured Group or holding company
of the Company who will issue shares or whose shares are to be sold pursuant to such IPO (the “IPO
Pushdown Entity,” and if any Topco Notes are not refinanced in full on or before the date of such IPO,

ratio calculations shall be made excluding any holding company of the IPO Pushdown Entity,
(iii) certain provisions of the Debt Documents (including representations, undertakings and events of
default) will cease to apply to any holding company of the IPO Pushdown Entity.

the Intercreditor Agreement which remains applicable following the Priority Discharge Date shall be
deemed to be a reference to the Topco Security Agent.

**DESCRIPTION OF THE SENIOR SECURED NOTES**

You will find definitions of certain capitalized terms used in this “Description of the Senior Secured
_Notes” under the heading “—Certain Definitions.” For purposes of this “Description of the Senior_
_Secured Notes,” references to (i) the “Senior Secured Notes Issuer” are to Ardonagh Finco Limited,_
and its successors, only and not to any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) the “Company” are to Ardonagh Midco
3 plc, and its successors, only and not to any of its Subsidiaries and (iii) the “Parent” are to Ardonagh
Midco 2 Ltd., and its successors, only and not to any of its Subsidiaries. References to “we” or “us” or
the “Group” are to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer will issue U.S.$500 million in aggregate principal amount of    %
Senior Secured Notes due 2031 (the “Dollar Senior Secured Notes”) and €500 million in aggregate
principal amount of    % Senior Secured Notes due 2031 (the “Euro Senior Secured Notes” and
together with the Dollar Senior Secured Notes, the “Senior Secured Notes”). Unless the context
otherwise requires, for all purposes of the Senior Secured Indenture and this “Description of the Senior
_Secured Notes”,_ references to “Senior Secured Notes” shall be deemed to include the Senior Secured
Notes initially issued on the Issue Date and any Additional Senior Secured Notes (as defined herein).
The Senior Secured Notes will be issued under an indenture to be dated as of      , 2024 (the “Senior
**Secured Indenture”), between, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, Ankura Trust Company, LLC, as**
trustee (the “Trustee”), as initial paying agent, as transfer agent (the “Transfer Agent”), as registrar
(the “Registrar”), and as security agent (the “Security Agent”), in a private transaction that is not
subject to the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act. The Senior Secured Indenture will
not be qualified under the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended.

The following description is a summary of the material provisions of the Senior Secured Indenture and
the Senior Secured Notes and refers to the Senior Secured Escrow Agreement, the Security Documents
and the Intercreditor Agreement. It does not restate those agreements in their entirety. We urge you to
read the Senior Secured Indenture, the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Secured Escrow Agreement,
the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement because they, and not this description, define
your rights as Holders of the Senior Secured Notes. Copies of the Senior Secured Indenture, the form
of the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Secured Escrow Agreement, the Security Documents and the
Intercreditor Agreement are available as set forth in this Offering Memorandum under the caption
“Where You Can Find More Information.”

We intend to use the proceeds of the offering of the Senior Secured Notes, together with proceeds from
drawings under the Term Facilities, proceeds from the Senior Notes (as defined below) sold on the Issue
Date and certain proceeds from the Retail Transaction, (i) to fund the Existing Notes Redemption; (ii)
to repay drawn amounts under the Existing Senior Secured Credit Facilities; (iii) to pay the fees and
expenses incurred in connection with the Transactions, including fees and expenses incurred in
connection with the offering of the Senior Secured Notes and redemption costs incurred in connection
with the Existing Notes Redemption; and (iv) for general corporate purposes, including one or more
acquisition opportunities in the near term. See “Use of Proceeds” and “Capitalization”.

Substantially concurrently with the closing of the offering, the gross proceeds of the Dollar Senior
Secured Notes sold on the Issue Date will be deposited into the Dollar Senior Secured Escrow Account
(as defined below) and the gross proceeds of the Euro Senior Secured Notes sold on the Issue Date will
be deposited into the Euro Senior Secured Escrow Account (as defined below). In the event that (i) the
Escrow Longstop Date (as defined below) occurs and the Escrow Agent (as defined below) shall not
have received the Escrow Release Officer’s Certificate (as defined below) on or prior to such date or
(ii) the Senior Secured Notes Issuer informs the Escrow Agent in writing that, in the good faith judgment
of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Escrow Release Condition (as defined below) will not be
completed on or prior to the Escrow Longstop Date, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will redeem the
entire outstanding aggregate principal amount of each of the Dollar Senior Secured Notes and the Euro
Senior Secured Notes at a price equal to 100% of the issue price of the respective Senior Secured Notes

200

as stated on the cover page of this offering memorandum, plus accrued and unpaid interest on the Senior
Secured Notes, and Additional Amounts, if any, from, and including, the Issue Date, to, but excluding,
the Special Mandatory Redemption Date (as defined below). See “Escrow of Proceeds; Special
_Mandatory Redemption.”_

The Senior Secured Indenture will be subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement (as defined below). The terms of the Intercreditor Agreement are
important to understanding relative ranking of indebtedness and security, the ability to make payments
in respect of the indebtedness, procedures for undertaking enforcement action, subordination of certain
indebtedness (including the Note Guarantees), turnover obligations, release of security and guarantees,
and the payment waterfall for amounts received by the Security Agent.

The registered Holder of a Senior Secured Note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. Only
registered Holders will have rights under the Senior Secured Indenture, including, without limitation,
with respect to enforcement and the pursuit of other remedies. The Senior Secured Notes have not been,
and will not be, registered under the U.S. Securities Act and are subject to certain transfer restrictions.

As of the Issue Date, all the Company’s Subsidiaries will be “Restricted Subsidiaries” for purposes of
the Senior Secured Indenture. However, under the circumstances described below under “—Certain
_Definitions—Unrestricted Subsidiary”, we will be permitted to designate certain of our Subsidiaries as_
“Unrestricted Subsidiaries.” Our Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive
covenants in the Senior Secured Indenture and will not guarantee the Senior Secured Notes.

**The Senior Secured Notes**

The Senior Secured Notes will:

- be general senior obligations of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer;

- be secured as set forth under “—Security”;

- rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future Indebtedness of the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer that is not expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Senior
Secured Notes;

- rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future Indebtedness of the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Senior Secured Notes;

- be guaranteed on a senior basis by the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors as described
under “—The Note Guarantees”;

- mature on    , 2031; and

- be represented by one or more registered notes in global registered form, but in certain
circumstances may be represented by Definitive Registered Notes (see “Book-Entry, Delivery
_and Form”)._

**The Note Guarantees**

**_General_**

Subject to and in accordance with the Agreed Security Principles, the Senior Secured Notes will be
guaranteed:

(a) on a senior basis on the Escrow Release Date by the Company; and

(b) on a senior basis on the Escrow Release Date by Ardonagh Finco plc, Ardonagh Services
Limited and each other borrower (if any) under and as defined in the Senior Secured Credit

201


-----

Facilities Agreement (the “Subsidiary Guarantors” and together with the Company, the
“Guarantors”).

In addition, subject to the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement and the Agreed Security Principles,
certain other Restricted Subsidiaries may provide a Note Guarantee in the future if required by the
covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Additional Guarantees”. The Note
Guarantees will be joint and several obligations of the Guarantors.

The Note Guarantee of each Guarantor will:

- be a general senior obligation of such Guarantor;

- be secured as set forth under “—Security”;

- rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future Indebtedness of such Guarantor
that is not expressly subordinated in right of payment to its Note Guarantee, including its
obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement (although any liabilities in
respect of obligations under the Super Senior Revolving Facility will, and certain hedging
agreements (if any) and certain other indebtedness that is secured by the Collateral may, receive
proceeds from an enforcement of such security (or any distressed disposal in lieu thereof) in
priority to the Holders);

- rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future Indebtedness of such Guarantor that
is expressly subordinated in right of payment to its Note Guarantee, including its Guarantee of
the Senior Notes;

- be effectively subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness or obligation of such
Guarantor that is secured by property and assets that do not secure such Note Guarantee, to the
extent of the value of the property and assets securing such Indebtedness; and

- be structurally subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness of the Subsidiaries of such
Guarantor that are not Guarantors, including obligations to trade creditors.

The obligations of a Guarantor under its Note Guarantee will be limited as necessary to prevent the
relevant Note Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance, preference, transfer at under value
or unlawful financial assistance under applicable law, or otherwise to reflect corporate benefit rules,
“thin capitalization” rules, retention of title claims, laws on the preservation of share capital, limitations
of corporate law, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally or other limitations
under applicable law which, among other things, might limit the amount that can be guaranteed by
reference to the net assets and legal capital of the relevant Guarantor. Additionally, the Note Guarantees
will be subject compliance with to certain corporate law procedures. The Note Guarantees will be
further limited as required under the Agreed Security Principles which apply to and restrict the
requirement to grant guarantees and security in favor of obligations under the Senior Secured Credit
Facilities Agreement and the Senior Secured Notes where, among other things, any such grant would
be restricted by general statutory or other legal limitations or requirements and may be precluded if the
cost of such grant is disproportionate to the benefit to the creditors, including the Holders, of obtaining
the applicable guarantee. By virtue of these limitations, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Note
Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Senior Secured Notes,
or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Note Guarantee.

All the operations of the Company will be conducted through its subsidiaries (collectively, the
“Group”) and, therefore, the Company and the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will depend on the cash
flow of the Group to meet their obligations, including the Company’s obligations under the Proceeds
Loan and the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s obligations under the Senior Secured Notes. Under
applicable local regulations, cash and cash equivalents held by the Group can only be upstreamed to
their direct or indirect parent entities, including to the Company for purposes of servicing its obligations

202


-----

under the Proceeds Loan, to the extent that sufficient profits available for distribution exist within these
legal entities and that they continue to meet relevant minimum regulatory capital requirements, as
applicable.

Given the regulated nature of our business, we have limited ability to grant upstream credit support. As
a result, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Guarantors will represent approximately 4.3% of our
Adjusted EBITDA (without giving effect to the Retail Transaction) for the twelve months ended
September 30, 2023. We intend to grant security in respect of the Senior Secured Notes from additional
non-guarantor entities, which, together with the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Guarantors,
represent 52.1% of our Adjusted EBITDA (without giving effect to the Retail Transaction) for the
twelve months ended September 30, 2023. As of September 30, 2023, after giving pro forma effect to
the Transactions and the Retail Transaction as if they had occurred on that date, the Company and its
consolidated Subsidiaries would have had £3,749 million (equivalent) of indebtedness, of which an
estimated £2,842 million (equivalent, including the Senior Secured Notes) represented senior secured
indebtedness and £108 million represented lease liabilities and other indebtedness of entities other than
the Company, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Guarantors. In addition, there would have been
£191.5 million (equivalent) available for drawing under the Super Senior Revolving Facility (prior to
giving effect to any increase in respect of commitments thereunder, which we expect may result in
between £240-300 million of commitments available for drawing) and, after giving effect to the
Transactions, an expected U.S.$175 million, €165 million and AUD100 million expected to be available
for drawing under CAR Facilities.

Claims of creditors of non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries, including trade creditors and creditors
holding debt and guarantees issued by those Restricted Subsidiaries, and claims of preferred
stockholders (if any) of those Restricted Subsidiaries and minority stockholders of non-Guarantor
Restricted Subsidiaries (if any) generally will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of
those Restricted Subsidiaries over the claims of creditors of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the
Guarantors, including Holders of the Senior Secured Notes. The Senior Secured Notes and each Note
Guarantee therefore will be structurally subordinated to creditors (including trade creditors) and
preferred stockholders (if any) of Restricted Subsidiaries of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer (other than
the Guarantors) and minority stockholders of non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries (if any). Although
the Senior Secured Indenture will limit the Incurrence of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and Preferred
Stock of Restricted Subsidiaries, the limitation is subject to a number of significant exceptions.
Moreover, the Senior Secured Indenture will not impose any limitation on the Incurrence by Restricted
Subsidiaries of liabilities that are not considered Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock
under the Senior Secured Indenture. See “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness.”

**_Note Guarantees Release_**

The Note Guarantees are subject to release under certain circumstances, including, but not limited to,
certain enforcement actions taken by the Security Agent acting at the direction of an instructing group
of senior secured creditors. The Note Guarantees of the Subsidiary Guarantors will also be subject to
the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement. For a description of the restrictions imposed by the
Intercreditor Agreement, see “Description of Other Indebtedness and Financing Arrangements—
_Intercreditor Agreement”._

The Note Guarantee of a Guarantor will automatically and unconditionally terminate and release:

- upon a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of the Capital
Stock of the relevant Subsidiary Guarantor (whether by direct sale or sale of a Holding
Company), if the sale or other disposition is not prohibited by the Senior Secured Indenture and
the Subsidiary Guarantor ceases to be a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of the sale or other
disposition;

203


-----

- so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, to the extent that such Subsidiary
Guarantor that provides a Guarantee under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement (i) is
unconditionally released and discharged from its liability with respect to the Senior Secured
Credit Facilities Agreement and (ii) is not providing a Guarantee in respect of any other Credit
Facility that replaces the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement or any Public Debt at such
time that will not also be released substantially simultaneously with the release of the Senior
Secured Notes Guarantee and/or a Guarantee under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities
Agreement;

- upon the sale or disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of all or substantially
all the assets of the Subsidiary Guarantor (other than to the Company or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries), if the sale or other disposition is not prohibited by the Senior Secured Indenture;

- upon the designation in accordance with the Senior Secured Indenture of the Subsidiary
Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary;

- with respect to any Subsidiary Guarantor, in connection with a solvent liquidation of such
Subsidiary Guarantor pursuant to which substantially all the assets of such Subsidiary
Guarantor remain owned by the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary;

- upon legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Senior Secured
Notes, as provided in “—Defeasance” and “—Satisfaction _and Discharge”;_

- upon the release of the Subsidiary Guarantor’s Note Guarantee under any Indebtedness that
triggered such Subsidiary Guarantor’s obligation to Guarantee the Senior Secured Notes under
the covenant described in “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Additional Guarantees”;

- in accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement;

- as described under “—Amendments and Waivers”;

- in connection with the implementation of a Permitted Reorganization;

- with respect to an entity that is not the successor Company or a successor Subsidiary Guarantor
(as applicable), as a result of a transaction permitted by “—Merger and Consolidation—The
_Company” or “—Merger and Consolidation—The Guarantors” (as applicable); or_

- in connection with any regulatory redress liability management exercise pursuant to clause
(24) of the definition of Asset Disposition or clause (21) of the definition of Permitted
Investments.

The Trustee and the Security Agent shall execute any documents or take all necessary actions
reasonably requested in writing by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, including the granting of releases
or waivers under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, to effectuate
any release of a Note Guarantee in accordance with these provisions, subject to customary protections
and indemnifications. Each of the releases set forth above shall be effected by the Trustee and the
Security Agent without the consent of or liability to the Holders or any other action or consent on the
part of the Trustee or the Security Agent.

**Principal, Maturity and Interest**

On the Issue Date, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will issue U.S.$500 million in aggregate principal
amount of Dollar Senior Secured Notes and €500 million in aggregate principal amount of Euro Senior
Secured Notes. The Senior Secured Notes Issuer may issue an unlimited principal amount of Additional
Senior Secured Notes under the Senior Secured Indenture from time to time, subject to all the covenants
in the Senior Secured Indenture, including the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—
_Limitation on Indebtedness”. The Senior Secured Notes and any Additional Senior Secured Notes_
subsequently issued under the Senior Secured Indenture will be treated as a single class for all purposes

204


-----

under the Senior Secured Indenture, including, without limitation, waivers, amendments, redemptions
and offers to purchase, except as otherwise provided in the Senior Secured Indenture. See “—Additional
_Senior Secured Notes”. The Dollar Senior Secured Notes will be issued in minimum denominations of_
U.S.$200,000 and integral multiples of U.S.$1,000 in excess thereof and the Euro Senior Secured Notes
will be issued in minimum denominations of €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess
thereof. The Senior Secured Notes will mature on    , 2031.

Interest on the Dollar Senior Secured Notes will accrue at the rate of      % per annum.

Interest on the Euro Senior Secured Notes will accrue at the rate of      % per annum.

Interest on the Senior Secured Notes will:

- accrue from the Issue Date or, if interest has already been paid, from the date it was most recently
paid;

- be payable semi-annually in arrears on     and     , commencing on     , 2024;

- be payable, for so long as the Senior Secured Notes are Global Notes (as defined below) to the
Holder of record of the Senior Secured Notes at the close of business (in DTC, Euroclear or
Clearstream (in each case, as applicable, the “Relevant Clearing System”)) to the Holders of
record of the Senior Secured Notes on       and       immediately preceding the related
interest payment date; and

- be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months.

Interest on overdue principal, premium or Additional Amounts will accrue at a rate that is 1% higher
than the rate of cash interest otherwise applicable to the Senior Secured Notes. In no event will the rate
of interest on the Senior Secured Notes be higher than the maximum rate permitted by law.

The rights of holders of beneficial interests in the Senior Secured Notes to receive the payments of
interest on such Senior Secured Notes are subject to applicable procedures of the Relevant Clearing
System. If the due date for any payment in respect of any Senior Secured Notes is not a Business Day
at the place at which such payment is due to be paid, the Holder thereof will not be entitled to payment
of the amount due until the next succeeding Business Day at such place, and will not be entitled to any
further interest or other payment as a result of any such delay, in accordance with the applicable
procedures of the Relevant Clearing System.

We cannot assure you that the Company’s Subsidiaries will have the ability to dividend or otherwise
distribute funds to the Company in order to allow the Company to pay interest on the Proceeds Loan in
order to allow the Senior Secured Notes Issuer to make cash interest payments on the Senior Secured
Notes. The ability of the Company’s Subsidiaries to make dividends or distributions to the Company is
subject to important exceptions. See “—The Senior Secured Notes” and “Description of Other
_Indebtedness and Financing Arrangements.”_

**_Methods of Receiving Payments on the Senior Secured Notes_**

Principal, interest and premium and Additional Amounts, if any, on the Global Notes (as defined below)
will be made by one or more Paying Agents by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
account specified by the registered Holder thereof (being the common depositary or its nominee for the
Relevant Clearing System).

Principal, interest and premium, and Additional Amounts, if any, on any certificated securities
(“Definitive Registered Notes”) will be payable at the specified office or agency of one or more Paying
Agents maintained for such purposes. In addition, interest on the Definitive Registered Notes may be
paid, at the option of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, by check mailed to the address of the Holder

205


-----

entitled thereto as shown on the register of Holders of Senior Secured Notes for the Definitive
Registered Notes. See “—Paying Agents, Transfer Agent and Registrar for the Senior Secured Notes”
below.

**_Paying Agents, Transfer Agent and Registrar for the Senior Secured Notes_**

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer will maintain one or more Paying Agents for the Senior Secured Notes.
The initial Paying Agent for the Dollar Senior Secured Notes will be Ankura Trust Company, LLC (the
“Dollar Paying Agent”) and the initial Paying Agent for the Euro Senior Secured Notes will be Elavon
Financial Services DAC (the “Euro Paying Agent,” and together with the Dollar Paying Agent, each,
a “Paying Agent”).

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer will also maintain a registrar (the “Registrar”) and a transfer agent
(the “Transfer Agent”). The initial Registrar will be Ankura Trust Company, LLC and the initial
Transfer Agent will be Ankura Trust Company, LLC. The Registrar will maintain a register reflecting
ownership of the Senior Secured Notes outstanding from time to time, if any, and together with the
Transfer Agent, will facilitate transfers of the Senior Secured Notes on behalf of the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer.

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer may change any Paying Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent for the
Senior Secured Notes without prior notice to the Holders of the Senior Secured Notes. The Senior
Secured Notes Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries may act as a Paying Agent or Registrar in respect of the
Senior Secured Notes.

**The Proceeds Loans**

On or about the Escrow Release Date, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will loan the proceeds of the
offering of Senior Secured Notes issued on the Issue Date to the Company pursuant to one or more
proceeds loans (the “Proceeds Loan”) lent under one or more proceeds loan agreements (the “Proceeds
**Loan Agreement”) to be dated as at the Escrow Release Date.**

The Proceeds Loan in respect of the Dollar Senior Secured Notes will be denominated in U.S. dollars
in a total aggregate principal amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of the Dollar Senior
Secured Notes issued on the Issue Date and the Proceeds Loan in respect of the Euro Senior Secured
Notes will be denominated in euros in a total aggregate principal amount equal to the aggregate principal
amount of the Euro Senior Secured Notes issued on the Issue Date. The Proceeds Loan Agreement will
provide that the Company will pay the Senior Secured Notes Issuer interest and principal in an amount
sufficient to pay amounts due under the Senior Secured Notes, as well as any Additional Amounts due
thereunder on a timely basis in order to ensure that the Senior Secured Notes Issuer can satisfy its
payment obligations under the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Indenture. The Proceeds
Loan Agreement will have the same maturity as the Senior Secured Notes.

The Proceeds Loan will be assigned by way of security to the Security Agent for the benefit of the
Holders.

**Additional Senior Secured Notes**

The Senior Secured Indenture will be unlimited in aggregate principal amount. From time to time,
subject to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s compliance with the covenants described under “—Certain
_Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens,” the Senior_
Secured Notes Issuer is permitted to issue additional Senior Secured Notes under the Senior Secured
Indenture (“Additional Senior Secured Notes”) of the same or different series, which shall have terms
substantially identical to the Senior Secured Notes except in respect of any of the following terms which

206


-----

shall be set forth in an Officer’s Certificate or, at the election of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, a
supplemental indenture, supplied to the Trustee:

(1) whether such Additional Senior Secured Notes shall be issued as part of a new or existing series
of Senior Secured Notes or the title of such Additional Senior Secured Notes (which shall
distinguish the Additional Senior Secured Notes of the series from Senior Secured Notes of any
other series);

(2) the aggregate principal amount of such Additional Senior Secured Notes;

(3) the issue price and the date or dates on which such Additional Senior Secured Notes will be issued;

(4) the rate or rates (which may be fixed or floating) at which such Additional Senior Secured Notes
shall bear interest and, if applicable, the interest rate basis, formula or other method of determining
such interest rate or rates, the date or dates from which such interest shall accrue, the interest
payment dates on which such interest shall be payable or the method by which such dates will be
determined, the record dates for the determination of holders thereof to whom such interest is
payable and the basis upon which such interest will be calculated;

(5) the currency or currencies in which such Additional Senior Secured Notes shall be denominated
and the currency in which cash or government obligations in connection with such series of
Additional Senior Secured Notes may be payable;

(6) the date or dates and price or prices at which, the period or periods within which, and the terms
and conditions upon which, such Additional Senior Secured Notes may be redeemed, in whole or
in part;

(7) if other than in denominations of U.S.$200,000 and in integral multiples of U.S.$1,000 in excess
thereof in respect of Dollar Senior Secured Notes or in denominations of €100,000 and in integral
multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof in respect of Euro Senior Secured Notes, the denominations
in which such Additional Senior Secured Notes shall be issued and redeemed;

(8) the CUSIP, ISIN, Common Code or other securities identification numbers with respect to such
Additional Senior Secured Notes; and

(9) any relevant limitation language with respect to Note Guarantees and Security Documents.

All series of Additional Senior Secured Notes will be treated, along with all other Senior Secured Notes,
as a single class for the purposes of the Senior Secured Indenture with respect to waivers, amendments
and all other matters which are not specifically distinguished for any applicable series; provided that if
the Additional Notes are not fungible for U.S. federal income tax purposes with the Initial Senior
Secured Notes, such Additional Notes will be issued with a separate ISIN, Common Code, CUSIP or
other securities identification number, as applicable, from the Initial Senior Secured Notes. Additional
Senior Secured Notes may be designated to be of the same series as the Initial Senior Secured Notes
and shall be deemed to form one series therewith.
**Transfer and Exchange**

The Senior Secured Notes will be issued in the form of several registered notes in global form without
interest coupons, as follows:

- Dollar Senior Secured Notes and Euro Senior Secured Notes sold within the United States to
qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act will initially each be
represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the
“144A Global Notes”). The 144A Global Notes will, on the Issue Date, be, in the case of such
Dollar Senior Secured Notes, deposited with a custodian for DTC and registered in the name of
Cede & Co., as nominee of DTC and, in the case of such Euro Senior Secured Notes, deposited
with and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of
Euroclear and Clearstream; and

207


-----

- Dollar Senior Secured Notes and Euro Senior Secured Notes sold to non-U.S. persons outside the
United States pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act will initially each be represented
by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the “Regulation
**S Global Notes” and, together with the 144A Global Notes, the “Global Notes”). The Regulation**
S Global Notes will, on the Issue Date, be, in the case of such Dollar Senior Secured Notes,
credited within DTC for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream and, in the case of such Euro
Senior Secured Notes, deposited with and registered in the name of the nominee of the common
depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.

Ownership of interests in the Global Notes (“Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons that
have accounts with the Relevant Clearing System or persons that may hold interests through such
participants.

Ownership of Book-Entry Interests and transfers thereof will be subject to the restrictions on transfer
and certification requirements summarized below and described more fully under “Notice to Investors”.
In addition, transfers of Book-Entry Interests between participants in the Relevant Clearing System will
be effected by the Relevant Clearing System pursuant to customary procedures and subject to the
applicable rules and procedures established by the Relevant Clearing System and its or their respective
participants.

Book-Entry Interests in the 144A Global Notes (the “144A Book-Entry Interests”) may be transferred
to a person who takes delivery in the form of Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Notes
(the “Regulation S Book-Entry Interests”) denominated in the same currency only upon delivery by
the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the Senior Secured Indenture) to the
effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S under the Securities Act.

Subject to the foregoing, Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes
delivery in the form of 144A Book-Entry Interests in the same currency only upon delivery by the
transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the Senior Secured Indenture) to the effect
that such transfer is being made to a person who the transferor reasonably believes is a “qualified
institutional buyer” within the meaning of Rule 144A in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule
144A or otherwise in accordance with the transfer restrictions described under “Notice to Investors”
and in accordance with any applicable securities law of any other jurisdiction.

Any Book-Entry Interest that is transferred as described in the immediately preceding paragraphs will,
upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note from which it was transferred and
will become a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note to which it was transferred. Accordingly, from
and after such transfer, it will become subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures
applicable to Book-Entry Interests in the Global Note to which it was transferred.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued, they will be issued only in minimum denominations of, in the
case of the Dollar Senior Secured Notes, U.S.$200,000 principal amount and integral multiples of
U.S.$1,000 in excess thereof, and in the case of the Euro Senior Secured Notes, €100,000 principal
amount and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof, upon receipt by the Registrar of instructions
relating thereto and any certificates, opinions and other documentation required by the Senior Secured
Indenture. It is expected that such instructions will be based upon directions received by the Relevant
Clearing System, as applicable, from the participant which owns the relevant Book-Entry Interests.
Definitive Registered Notes issued in exchange for a Book-Entry Interest will, except as set forth in the
Senior Secured Indenture or as otherwise determined by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer in compliance
with applicable law, be subject to, and will have a legend with respect to, the restrictions on transfer
summarized below and described more fully under “Notice to Investors”.

Subject to the restrictions on transfer referred to above, Notes issued as Definitive Registered Notes
may be transferred or exchanged, in whole or in part, in minimum denominations of, in the case of the

208


-----

Dollar Senior Secured Notes, U.S.$200,000 in principal amount and integral multiples of U.S.$1,000
in excess thereof, and in the case of the Euro Senior Secured Notes, €100,000 principal amount and
integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. In connection with any such transfer or exchange, the
Senior Secured Indenture will require the transferring or exchanging Holder to, among other things,
furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents, to furnish information regarding the account
of the transferee at the Relevant Clearing System, where appropriate, to furnish certain certificates and
opinions, and to pay any Taxes in connection with such transfer or exchange. Any such transfer or
exchange will be made without charge to the Holder, other than any Taxes payable in connection with
such transfer.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Registrar and the Transfer Agent are not required to register the
transfer or exchange of any Dollar Senior Secured Notes:

(1) for a period of 15 days prior to any date fixed for the redemption of the Dollar Senior Secured
Notes;

(2) for a period of 15 days immediately prior to the date fixed for selection of the Dollar Senior
Secured Notes to be redeemed in part;

(3) for a period of 15 days prior to the record date with respect to any interest payment date of the
Dollar Senior Secured Notes; or

(4) which the Holder has tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a Change
of Control Offer, an Asset Disposition Offer or any other tender offer in respect of the Dollar
Senior Secured Notes.

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Trustee, any Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent and the Registrar
will be entitled to treat the registered Holder of a Senior Secured Note as the owner thereof for all
purposes.

**Security**

**_General_**

On the Issue Date, the Senior Secured Notes and the Note Guarantees will be secured on a first-ranking
basis by the Senior Secured Escrow Charges. Upon receipt by the Trustee of an Escrow Release
Officer’s Certificate or a notice of Special Mandatory Redemption, the Escrowed Property will be
released and the first-ranking security interests over the Escrowed Property will automatically be
released and terminate.

No later than the Escrow Release Date, the Senior Secured Notes and the Note Guarantees will be
secured on a first-ranking basis:

- by third-party, limited recourse security over (i) the shares of Company held by the Parent; and
(ii) structural intercompany receivables owed to the Parent by the Company (if any) (the
“Shared Collateral”);

- by security over the shares owned by any Guarantor in the capital of any other Guarantor;

- by security over the material bank accounts of each Guarantor which are located in its
jurisdiction of organization (without control over use);

- by security over any intercompany receivables owed to any Guarantor by the Company or any
Restricted Subsidiary;

209


-----

- by security by way of a springing security interest over substantially all assets of each Guarantor
organized under the laws of Australia which are located in Australia pursuant to an Australian
law general security deed;

- by security over substantially all assets of each Guarantor organized under the laws of England
pursuant to an English law debenture;

- by security over substantially all assets of each Guarantor located in Australia pursuant to an
Australian law security deed; and

- by security over substantially all the assets of each Guarantor organized under the laws of the
United States (or any state or political sub-division thereof) which are located in the United
States or any state thereof (including the District of Columbia) and where such security is
capable of being registered and perfected solely by customary UCC-1 filings in the grantor’s
jurisdiction of incorporation or formation, pursuant to a New York law security agreement.

No later than the earlier of the date that is 30 calendar days following the Escrow Release Date and the
date on which obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement have been so secured,
the Senior Secured Notes and the Note Guarantees will be secured on a first-ranking basis

- by security (on a third party, limited recourse basis, where granted by a person other than a
Guarantor) over (i) the shares held by Ardonagh Advisory Broking Holdings Limited (formerly
known as Ardonagh Advisory Holdings Limited) in the capital of Advisory Insurance Brokers
Limited (formerly known as Towergate Underwriting Group Limited), (ii) Ardonagh Specialty
Holdings Limited’s shares in the capital of Ardonagh Specialty Limited (formerly known as
Price Forbes & Partners Limited), (iii) Nevada Investments Holdings Limited’s shares in the
capital of Ardonagh Specialty Holdings Limited, (iv) Arachas Bidco Designated Activity
Company’s shares in the capital of Arachas Corporate Brokers Limited, (v) Ardonagh Services
Limited’s shares in the capital of Nevada 5 Topco Limited, (vi) Nevada Investments TopCo
Limited’s shares in the capital of Atlanta Investment Holdings 3 Limited, (vii) Paymentshield
Group Holdings Limited’s shares in the capital of Paymentshield Limited and (viii) Swinton
(Holdings) Limited’s shares in the capital of Atlanta Insurance Intermediaries Limited
(formerly known as Swinton Group Limited), provided that the security in foregoing
paragraphs (vi) to (viii) shall be released upon completion of the Retail Transaction.

The foregoing together with any and all assets from time to time in which a security interest has been
or will be granted pursuant to any Security Document to secure the obligations under the Senior Secured
Indenture, the Senior Secured Notes and/or any Note Guarantee, the “Collateral”.

As described above, the Collateral also secures obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities
Agreement and certain hedging obligations and may also secure any Additional Senior Secured Notes
and certain other future Indebtedness. In addition, the Shared Collateral will also secure obligations
under the Senior Notes. In addition, any liabilities in respect of obligations under the Super Senior
Revolving Facility will, and certain hedging agreements (if any) and certain other indebtedness that is
secured by the Collateral may, receive proceeds from an enforcement of such security (or any distressed
disposal in lieu thereof) in priority to the Holders. The proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral
may not be sufficient to satisfy the obligations owed to the Holders of the Senior Secured Notes. No
appraisals of the Collateral have been made in connection with this issuance of Senior Secured Notes.
By its nature, some or all the Collateral will be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market
value. Accordingly, the Collateral may not be able to be sold in a short period of time, or at all. See
“Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Note Guarantees and the Collateral—The Notes will be
_secured only to the extent of the value of the Collateral that has been granted as security for the Notes_
_and future secured debt may be secured by certain assets that do not secure the Notes. The value of the_

210


-----

_Collateral securing the Notes may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations under the Notes and such_
_Collateral may be reduced or diluted under certain circumstances.”_

Notwithstanding the provisions of the covenant described below under “—Certain Covenants—
_Limitation on Liens,” certain property, rights and assets may not be pledged, and any pledge over_
property, rights and assets may be limited (or the Liens not perfected), in accordance with the Agreed
Security Principles, the Intercreditor Agreement and certain perfection requirements.

The following is a non-exhaustive summary of certain terms of the Agreed Security Principles, which
include, among others:

The Collateral shall not be required to include assets other than:

- (i) the Shared Collateral, (ii) security over the shares owned by any Guarantor in the capital of
any other Guarantor; (iii) security over the material bank accounts of each Guarantor which are
located in its jurisdiction of organization (without control over use); (iv) security over any
intercompany receivables owed to any Guarantor by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary;
(v) security by way of a springing security interest over substantially all assets of each
Guarantor organized under the laws of Australia which are located in Australia pursuant to an
Australian law general security deed; (vi) by security over substantially all assets of each
Guarantor organized under the laws of England or Ireland pursuant to an English law or Irish
law (as applicable) debenture; (vii) security over substantially all the assets of each Guarantor
organized under the laws of the United States (or any state or political sub-division thereon)
which are located in the United States or any state thereof (including the District of Columbia)
and where such security is capable of being registered and perfected solely by customary UCC1 filings in the grantor's jurisdiction of incorporation or formation; and (viii) security over the
shares in the capital of certain material subsidiaries of the Company where such security is
required to be granted by the terms of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement;

- general legal and statutory limitations, regulatory restrictions, financial assistance, anti-trust
and other competition authority restrictions, corporate benefit, fraudulent preference, equitable
subordination, “transfer pricing,” “thin capitalization” (and in particular, guarantees and
security shall not result in all or part of the Senior Secured Notes being considered related debt
for thin capitalization purposes), “earnings stripping,” “controlled foreign corporation” and
other tax restrictions, “exchange control restrictions,” “capital maintenance” rules and
“liquidity impairment” rules, retention of title claims, employee consultation or approval
requirements and similar principles may limit the ability of a member of the Group to provide
a guarantee or security or may require that the guarantee or security be limited as to amount or
otherwise and, if so, the guarantee or security will be limited accordingly; provided that, to the
extent reasonably requested by the Security Agent, the relevant member of the Group shall use
reasonable endeavors (exercised for a specified period of time but without incurring material
cost and without adverse impact on relationships with third parties) to overcome any such
obstacle or otherwise such guarantee or security document shall be subject to such limit;

- the exclusion of any guarantee or security interest to the extent that the grant thereof would (i)
be prohibited by or require consent from any central bank, supervisory authority, government,
statutory body or other regional, national or international regulatory body (each a “Regulator”),
(ii) require the Company or any of its Affiliates to directly or indirectly hold additional
regulatory, segregated and/or restricted capital (howsoever described); (iii) require the
Company or any of its Affiliates to directly or indirectly deposit or deliver (or procure the
deposit or delivery of) any additional collateral with, or grant any additional credit support to,
for the benefit of or as directed by, any Regulator; (iv) require the Company or any of its
Affiliates to directly or indirectly increase the nominal or actual amount of any insurance
coverage provided it to in connection with the requirements of any Regulator or (v) otherwise

211


-----

be reasonably likely to have an adverse effect on any license, consent or authorization granted
or to be granted by any Regulator (including any renewal thereof);

- the determination that the time and cost (including adverse effects on taxes, interest
deductibility, stamp duty, registration taxes, notarial costs, guarantee fees payable to any person
that is not a member of the Group and all applicable legal fees) will not be disproportionate to
the benefit accruing to the relevant secured parties of obtaining such guarantee or security;

- the exclusion from any guarantee or security of any asset subject to a legal requirement,
contract, lease, license, instrument, regulatory constraint (including any agreement with any
government or regulatory body) or other third party arrangement, which may prevent or
condition the asset from being charged, secured or being subject to the applicable security
document (including requiring a consent of any third party, supervisory board or works council
(or equivalent)) and any asset which, if subject to the applicable security document, would give
a third party the right to terminate or otherwise amend any rights, benefits and/or obligations
with respect to any member of the Group in respect of the asset or require the relevant charger
to take any action materially adverse to the interests of the Group or any member thereof;
_provided that reasonable endeavors (exercised for a specified period of time but without_
incurring material cost and without adverse impact on relationships with third parties) to obtain
consent to charging any asset (where otherwise prohibited) shall be used by the Group if the
Security Agent (acting reasonably) specifies upon reasonable notice that the asset is material
and the Senior Secured Notes Issuer is satisfied that such endeavors will not involve placing
relationships with third parties in jeopardy;

- the agreement that members of the Group will not be required to give guarantees or enter into
security documents if they are not wholly owned by another member of the Group or if it is not
within the legal capacity of the relevant members of the Group or if it would conflict with the
fiduciary or statutory duties of their directors or contravene any applicable legal, regulatory or
contractual prohibition or restriction or have the potential to result in a material risk of personal
or criminal liability for any director or officer of or for any member of the Group; provided
that, to the extent reasonably requested by the Security Agent on reasonable notice, the relevant
member of the Group, in relation to a contractual prohibition or restriction only, shall use
reasonable endeavors (exercised for a specified period of time but without incurring material
cost and without adverse impact on relationships with third parties) to overcome any such
obstacle or otherwise such guarantee or security document shall be subject to such limit;

- the requirement that, to the extent legally effective, all security shall be given in favor of the
Security Agent and not the Holders individually (with the Security Agent to hold one set of
security documents for all the Holders); provided that it shall be permissible to use “parallel
debt” provisions where necessary (which shall be included in the Intercreditor Agreement and
not the individual security documents); and furthermore, the agreement that no member of the
Group shall be required to take any action in relation to any guarantees or security as a result
of any assignment or transfer of the Senior Secured Notes by a Holder;

- the limitation of guarantees and security so that the aggregate of notarial costs and all
registration and like taxes and duties relating to the provision of security will not exceed an
amount to be agreed between the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Security Agent, and the
agreement that where a class of assets to be secured includes material and immaterial assets, if
the cost of granting security over the immaterial assets is disproportionate to the benefit of such
security, security will be granted over the material assets only;

- the agreement that security will not be required over any assets subject to security in favor of a
third party or any cash constituting regulatory capital or customer cash (and such assets or cash
shall be excluded from any relevant security document);

212


-----

- the agreement it may be either impossible or impractical to create security over certain
categories of assets in which event security will not be taken over such assets;

- the agreement that no security may be provided on terms which are inconsistent with the
turnover or sharing provisions in the Intercreditor Agreement;

- the agreement that the giving of a guarantee, the granting of security and the registration and/or
the perfection of the security granted will not be required if it would have a material adverse
effect on the ability of the relevant member of the Group to conduct its operations and business
in the ordinary course as otherwise permitted by the Senior Secured Notes Documents
(including dealing with the secured assets and all contractual counterparties or amending,
waiving or terminating (or allowing to lapse) any rights, benefits or obligations, in each case
prior to an Event of Default which is continuing), and the agreement that any requirement under
the Agreed Security Principles to seek consent of any person or take or not take any other action
shall be subject to the Agreed Security Principles;

- the agreement that other than a general security agreement and related filing, no perfection,
filing or other action will be required with respect to assets of a type not owned by members of
the Group;

- the agreement that no guarantees or security by any members of the Group which are organized,
established or incorporated in Dubai, Malaysia or South Africa;

- the agreement (i) that security in respect of the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured
Notes Guarantees will only be granted over the Collateral or as otherwise expressly provided
in the Senior Secured Indenture, (ii) that security will not be required from or over the assets
of, any joint venture or similar arrangement, any minority interest or any member of the Group
that is not wholly owned by another member of the Group, and (iii) no security will be required
to be granted over certain categories of assets, including, among other things, real estate,
intellectual property, letter of credit rights and insurance policies; and

- the agreement that no member of the Group will be required to grant security over any cash,
cash equivalent investments or other assets constituting regulatory, segregated and/or restricted
capital (howsoever described).

generally available to providers of Collateral (including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or
transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose or benefit, capital maintenance or
similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other considerations
under applicable law, see “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations”.

**_Priority_**

The relative priority with regard to the security interests in the Collateral that are created by the Security
Documents (the “Security Interests” and each, a “Security Interest”) as between (a) the lenders under
the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement and the lenders of certain future indebtedness that is
_pari passu_ with the obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement, (b) the
counterparties under certain hedging obligations, (c) the Holders of the Senior Secured Notes, (d) the
Trustee and the Security Agent, (e) the Holders of the Senior Notes and (f) the creditors of certain other
Indebtedness permitted to be secured by the Collateral, respectively, is established by the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents, which will provide, among other things, that the
obligations under the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Indenture will be secured on a pro
_rata basis with the claims of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement, certain hedging_
obligations and creditors under any future indebtedness that may be secured on a first-ranking basis in

213


-----

accordance with the terms of the Senior Secured Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement, subject to
the right for the lenders in respect of the Super Senior Revolving Facility and the counterparties in
respect of certain hedging obligations and certain other indebtedness to receive proceeds from an
enforcement of such security (or any distressed disposal in lieu thereof) in priority to the Holders and
the lenders of the Term Facilities and the CAR Facilities. See “Description of Other Indebtedness and
_Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement”, “—Release of Liens,” “—Certain Covenants—_
_Impairment of Security Interest” and “—Certain Definitions—Permitted Collateral Liens.”_

**_Security Documents_**

Under the Security Documents, the Parent, the Guarantors and the Senior Secured Notes Issuer have
granted, or will grant, security over the Collateral to secure the payment when due of the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ payment obligations under the Senior Secured Notes, the Note
Guarantees and the Senior Secured Indenture. The Security Documents have been, or will be, entered
into by the relevant security provider and (other than the Senior Secured Escrow Charges) the Security
Agent as agent or security trustee for the secured parties. When entering into the Security Documents,
the Security Agent has acted in its own name, but for the benefit of the secured parties (including itself,
the Trustee and the holders of Senior Secured Notes from time to time).

The Senior Secured Escrow Charges shall be granted solely for the benefit of the Trustee on behalf of
the Holders of the applicable series of Senior Secured Notes, and no other persons (including for the
avoidance of doubt any lender under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement, any holder of
Senior Notes, counterparties under any Hedging Obligations or any other creditors) shall be entitled to
benefit from the Senior Secured Escrow Charges.

The Senior Secured Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement provide that, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, only the Security Agent will have the right to enforce the Security Documents on behalf
of the Trustee and the holders of the Senior Secured Notes. As a consequence of such contractual
provisions, holders of the Senior Secured Notes will not be entitled to take enforcement action in respect
of the Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes, except through the Trustee under the Senior
Secured Indenture, who will (subject to the provisions of the Senior Secured Indenture) provide
instructions to the Security Agent in respect of the enforcement of the Collateral. See “Description of
_Other Indebtedness and Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”_

The Senior Secured Indenture will provide that, subject to the terms thereof and of the Security
Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement, the Senior Secured Notes and the Note Guarantees, as
applicable, will be secured by Security Interests in the Collateral until all obligations under the Senior
Secured Notes, the Note Guarantees and the Senior Secured Indenture have been discharged. However,
the Security Interests with respect to the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Indenture may
be released under certain circumstances as provided under “—Release of Liens.”

In the event that the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or its Subsidiaries enter into insolvency, bankruptcy
or similar proceedings, the Security Interests created under the Security Documents or the rights and
obligations enumerated in the Intercreditor Agreement could be subject to potential challenges. If any
challenge to the validity of the Security Interests or the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement were
successful, the Holders may not be able to recover any amounts under the Security Documents.

Subject to the terms of the Senior Secured Indenture, the Security Documents, the Intercreditor
Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the Parent, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer
and the Guarantors will have the right to remain in possession and retain exclusive control of the
Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes, to freely operate the property and assets constituting
Collateral and to collect, invest and dispose of any income therefrom (including any and all dividends,
distributions or similar cash and non-cash payments in respect of Capital Stock of the Guarantors that
is part of the Collateral).

214


-----

**_Enforcement of Security Interest_**

The Senior Secured Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement restrict the ability of the Security Agent
(acting on its behalf or on behalf of the Holders) to enforce the Security Interests and provide for the
release of the Security Interests created by the Security Documents. The rights of the Security Agent to
take enforcement action under the Security Documents are subject to certain limitations on enforcement
pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement. The ability to enforce may also be restricted by
similar arrangements in relation to future Indebtedness that is secured on the Collateral in compliance
with the Senior Secured Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement. See “Description of Other
_Indebtedness and Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement”._

The Trustee has authorized the Security Agent to (i) perform the duties and exercise the rights, powers
and discretions that are specifically given to it under the Intercreditor Agreement and the security
documents securing such Indebtedness, together with any other incidental rights, power and discretions;
and (ii) execute each Security Document, waiver, modification, amendment, renewal or replacement
expressed to be executed by the relevant Security Agent on its behalf.

**_Intercreditor Agreement; Additional Intercreditor Agreements; Agreement to be Bound_**

The Senior Secured Indenture will provide that it will be subject to the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement
and that the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Trustee will be authorized (without any further consent of the
Holders of the Senior Secured Notes) to enter into the Intercreditor Agreement and to give effect to its provisions.

The Senior Secured Indenture will provide that each Holder of the Senior Secured Notes, by accepting such Senior
Secured Note, will be deemed to have:

- irrevocably appointed the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into and act as its agent under the
Intercreditor Agreement and the other relevant documents to which it is a party (including, without
limitation, in respect of the Security Agent, the Security Documents);

- irrevocably authorized the Security Agent to (i) perform the duties and exercise the rights, powers and
discretions that are specifically given to it under the Intercreditor Agreement or other documents to which
it is a party (including, without limitation, the Security Documents), together with any other incidental
rights, power and discretions; and (ii) execute each document, waiver, modification, amendment,
renewal or replacement expressed to be executed by the Security Agent on its behalf; and

- accepted the terms and conditions of, and agreed to be bound by, the Intercreditor Agreement and any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement and any Security Document and each Holder will also be deemed to
have authorized the Trustee to enter into and act as its agent under any such Additional Intercreditor
Agreement.

The Intercreditor Agreement overrides any provisions in the Senior Secured Indenture and to the extent that any
step or action is permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement, it will be deemed permitted under the Senior Secured
Indenture.

Similar provisions to those described above may be included in any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (as
defined below) entered into in compliance with the provisions described under “—Certain Covenants—
_Additional Intercreditor Agreements”._

**_Release of Liens_**

The Parent and its Subsidiaries will be entitled to release the Security Interests in respect of the Collateral under
any one or more of the following circumstances:

(1) in connection with any sale or other disposition of Collateral to a Person that is not the Company or a
Restricted Subsidiary (but excluding any transaction subject to “—Merger and Consolidation”), if such
sale or other disposition does not violate the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation

215


-----

_on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock” or is otherwise permitted in accordance with the Senior Secured_
Indenture;

(2) in the case of a Guarantor that is released from its Note Guarantee pursuant to the terms of the Senior
Secured Indenture, the release of the property and assets, and Capital Stock, of such Guarantor;

(3) as described under “—Amendments and Waivers”;

(4) upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations on the Senior Secured Notes or legal
defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Senior Secured Notes, as provided in
“—Defeasance” and “—Satisfaction and Discharge”;

(5) if the Company designates any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with
the applicable provisions of the Senior Secured Indenture, the release of the property and assets, and Capital
Stock, of such Unrestricted Subsidiary;

(6) in connection with the implementation of a Permitted Reorganization;

(7) in connection with the granting of Liens on such property or assets, which may include Collateral, or the
sale or transfer of such property or assets, which may include Collateral, in each case pursuant to a Qualified
Receivables Financing;

(8) in connection with any disposal of Collateral to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary; provided that such
release is followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent ranking over the same assets
in a manner consistent with, and pursuant to applicable formalities under, the covenant described under “—
_Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest”;_

(9) with respect to the Security Interests in respect of the Capital Stock of the Company to be offered, within
a reasonable time to facilitate an Initial Public Offering in which the Company is the IPO Entity; provided
that such Security Interests so released shall be promptly granted or re-granted, as applicable, in favor of
the Senior Secured Notes in the event that such Capital Stock is not sold or the Initial Public Offering does
not complete for any reason;

(10) in connection with the Retail Transaction, the security over Nevada Investments TopCo Limited’s shares
in the capital of Atlanta Investment Holdings 3 Limited, Paymentshield Group Holdings Limited’s shares
in the capital of Paymentshield Limited and Swinton (Holdings) Limited’s shares in the capital of Atlanta
Insurance Intermediaries Limited (formerly known as Swinton Group Limited); or

(11) as otherwise permitted in accordance with the Senior Secured Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

In addition, the Security Interests created by the Security Documents will be released (a) in accordance with an
enforcement action pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement
and (b) as may be permitted by the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of
_Security Interest.”_

The Security Interests over the assets subject to the Senior Secured Escrow Charges will be released
upon the occurrence of the Escrow Release or in connection with the Special Mandatory Redemption.

The Security Agent (and if necessary the Trustee) shall execute any documents or will take all necessary
action reasonably requested in writing by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer to effectuate any release of
Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes and the Note Guarantees, in accordance with the
provisions of the Senior Secured Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement and the relevant Security Document subject to customary protections and indemnifications.
Each of the releases set forth above shall occur automatically without the consent of the Holders, and
without any action on the part of the Security Agent or the Trustee (unless action is required by it to
give effect to such release).

**Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption**

The Offering will be consummated prior to the funding under the New Senior Secured Credit
Facilities. Substantially concurrently with the closing of the Offering, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer

216


-----

will enter into an escrow agreement (as amended, supplemented or modified from time to time, the
“Senior Secured Escrow Agreement”) among the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Trustee, Ankura
Trust Company, LLC, as escrow agent (in such capacity, together with its successors, the “Escrow
**Agent”), pursuant to which the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will deposit, or cause to be deposited on**
its behalf, an amount in cash equal to (x) the gross proceeds of the Dollar Senior Secured Notes sold on
the Issue Date into one escrow account (the “Dollar Senior Secured Escrow Account”) and (y) the
gross proceeds of the Euro Senior Secured Notes sold on the Issue Date into another escrow account
(the “Euro Senior Secured Escrow Account” and together with the Dollar Senior Secured Escrow
Account, the “Senior Secured Escrow Accounts”). The Senior Secured Escrow Accounts established
will each be segregated from the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s other funds. The Escrow Accounts will
be controlled by the Senior Secured Escrow Agent subject to the terms of the Senior Secured Escrow
Agreement, on behalf of the Trustee and the Holders of the applicable series of Senior Secured Notes.
The initial funds deposited in each of the Escrow Accounts, and all other funds, securities, interest,
dividends, distributions and other property and payments credited to the Senior Secured Escrow
Accounts in connection with the Senior Secured Notes (less any property and/or funds paid in
accordance with the Senior Secured Escrow Account Agreement, such as ordinary course charges and
fees paid to the bank holding the Senior Secured Escrow Accounts) are referred to, collectively, as the
“Escrowed Property.” From and including the Issue Date, including while the proceeds of the Senior
Secured Notes are deposited in the Senior Secured Escrow Accounts, interest in respect of the Senior
Secured Notes will be calculated in accordance with the terms of the Senior Secured Indenture and
Senior Secured Notes.

To secure the payment of the Special Mandatory Redemption Price (as defined below) of the Senior
Secured Notes, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will grant the Trustee, for its benefit and for the benefit
of the Holders of the applicable series of Senior Secured Notes, subject to certain liens of the Escrow
Agent, a first-priority security interest in the Senior Secured Escrow Accounts, and the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer’s rights under the Senior Secured Escrow Agreement, pursuant to one or more escrow
account charges dated the Issue Date between the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Trustee and the
Escrow Agent (the “Senior Secured Escrow Charges”); _provided, however, that such liens and_
security interest shall automatically be released and terminated upon receipt by the Trustee of either an
Escrow Release Officer’s Certificate (as defined below) or a notice of Special Mandatory Redemption
(as defined below). The Senior Secured Escrow Charges will provide that the funds will be segregated
and held for the purposes specified herein. By its acceptance of the Senior Secured Notes, each Holder
shall be deemed to authorize and direct the Trustee to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under
the Senior Secured Escrow Agreement. The Escrow Agent will invest the Escrowed Property as directed
by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer in such short-term liquid investments (including bank deposit
products) as permitted under the Escrow Agreement, and liquidate such investments as the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer will from time to time direct in writing.

The Senior Secured Escrow Agreement shall provide for the Escrow Agent to release from each Senior
Secured Escrow Account, upon the instruction of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, a portion of the
Escrowed Property in an amount equal to the amount of accrued and unpaid interest and Additional
Amounts, if any, from, and including, the Issue Date or the most recent interest payment date, as
applicable, to, but excluding, any interest payment date prior to the Escrow Release in order to satisfy
the interest payment obligations in respect of the Senior Secured Notes under the Indenture as set forth
under “Principal, Maturity and Interest.” In addition, the Escrow Agent will be entitled pursuant to the
Senior Secured Escrow Agreement to deduct amounts from the Escrowed Property in respect of
negative interest having accrued on the Escrowed Property (if any).

Other than in connection with the payment of interest and Additional Amounts, if any, as set forth in
the previous paragraph, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will be entitled to cause the Escrow Agent to
release Escrowed Property (in which case the Escrowed Property will be paid to, or as directed by, the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer) (the “Escrow Release”) (the date of the Escrow Release being referred to
as the “Escrow Release Date”) upon delivery to the Escrow Agent, on or prior to March 31, 2024 (the
“Escrow Longstop Date”) of an Officer’s Certificate (the “Escrow Release Officer’s Certificate”),

217


-----

upon which the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely absolutely without further investigation,
certifying that the funding under the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities as described in Summary—
_Recent Developments—The Refinancing in this offering memorandum has occurred (the “Escrow_
**Condition”) substantially concurrently with or promptly following the Escrow Release on the Escrow**
Release Date.

Upon the Escrow Release, the Escrowed Property will be paid out of the Senior Secured Escrow
Accounts in accordance with the Senior Secured Escrow Agreement for the purposes described under
“Use of Proceeds” and the Senior Secured Escrow Accounts will be reduced to zero.

In the event that (i) the Escrow Longstop Date occurs and the Escrow Agent shall not have received the
Escrow Release Officer’s Certificate on or prior to such date or (ii) the Senior Secured Notes Issuer
informs the Escrow Agent and the Trustee in writing that, in the good faith judgment of the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer, the Escrow Condition will not be satisfied on or prior to the Escrow Longstop
Date (the date of any such event being the “Special Termination Date”), the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer will redeem the entire outstanding aggregate principal amount of each series of the Senior
Secured Notes (the “Special Mandatory Redemption”) at a price (the “Special Mandatory
**Redemption Price”) equal to 100% of the issue price of such series of Senior Secured Notes as stated**
on the cover page of this offering memorandum, plus accrued and unpaid interest on the Senior Secured
Notes and Additional Amounts, if any, from, and including, the Issue Date, to, but excluding, the Special
Mandatory Redemption Date (as defined below), subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant
record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date.

Notice of the Special Mandatory Redemption will be delivered by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer no
later than one Business Day following the Special Termination Date, to the Trustee, the Escrow Agent
and the Paying Agents, and will provide that the Senior Secured Notes shall be redeemed on a date that
is no later than the tenth Business Day after such notice is given by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer in
accordance with the terms of the Senior Secured Escrow Agreement (the “Special Mandatory
**Redemption Date”). On the Special Mandatory Redemption Date, the Escrow Agent shall pay to the**
relevant Paying Agent for payment to each Holder of the relevant series of Senior Secured Notes the
Special Mandatory Redemption Price for such Holder’s Senior Secured Notes, and the Escrow Agent
shall be entitled to use the Escrowed Property to make such payments and, concurrently with the
payment to such Holders, deliver any excess Escrowed Property (if any) to the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer. Notice of such Special Mandatory Redemption shall be given to the Holders of the Senior
Secured Notes at least five Business Days before the Special Mandatory Redemption Date.

The Senior Secured Escrow Accounts will not include cash to fund any accrued and unpaid interest
owing to Holders of the Senior Secured Notes, which is included in the Special Mandatory Redemption
Price. In the event that the Special Mandatory Redemption Price payable upon such Special Mandatory
redemption of the Senior Secured Notes exceeds the amount of the applicable Escrowed Property, the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer would be required to fund such amounts from other sources available to it.

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer from time to time, but not more than twice in aggregate, may open
one or more replacement or additional accounts at an alternative bank or financial institution, and may
transfer any portion of the Escrowed Property to any such replacement or additional accounts (a
“Transfer”) without such Transfer being deemed an Escrow Release; provided that the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer provides a substantially equivalent security interest to the Trustee for its benefit and for
the benefit of the Holders over such replacement or additional account or accounts if such security
interest was initially granted in connection with the original Senior Secured Escrow Account; and
_provided further that use of the funds from any such account shall be subject to the same conditions as_
applied to the original Senior Secured Escrow Account. In such an event, any replacement or alternative
accounts into which the Escrowed Property is transferred shall be deemed to be a Senior Secured
Escrow Account. Receipt by the Trustee from the Senior Secured Notes Issuer of an Officer’s
Certificate in connection with a Transfer shall constitute deemed consent by the Trustee for the transfer
of the Escrowed Property from the original Senior Secured Escrow Account to a new Escrow Account.

218


-----

If at the time of such Special Mandatory Redemption the Senior Secured Notes are listed on the Official
List of the Exchange and the rules of the Exchange so require, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will
notify the Exchange that the Special Mandatory Redemption has occurred and any relevant details
relating to such Special Mandatory Redemption.

In addition, the conditions applicable to a Special Mandatory Redemption may be waived or modified
by Holders representing a majority in aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Notes then
outstanding.

requests that the Trustee distribute to the Holders amounts deposited in trust with the Trustee (which,

the Trustee in writing (which may be included in the applicable redemption notice) to deliver to Holders
such amounts deposited with the Trustee either (i) on or promptly after the date fixed for redemption or
(ii) any such earlier payment date as selected by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer.

221


-----

**Mandatory Payment; Transactions in the Senior Secured Notes**

Except as described under the caption “Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption,” the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer is not required to make mandatory redemption payments or sinking fund
payments with respect to the Senior Secured Notes. As market conditions warrant, we and our
shareholders, including the Permitted Holders, their respective Affiliates and members of our
management, may from time to time seek to purchase or otherwise transact in our outstanding debt
securities or loans, including the Senior Secured Notes or derivative instruments related thereto, in
privately negotiated or open market transactions, by tender offer or otherwise. Subject to any applicable
limitations contained in the agreements governing our indebtedness, including the Senior Secured
Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, any purchases
made by us may be funded by the use of cash on our balance sheet or the incurrence of new secured or
unsecured debt, including borrowings under our credit facilities or any other source. The amounts
involved in any such purchase transactions, individually or in the aggregate, may be material. Any such
purchases may be with respect to a substantial amount of a particular class or series of debt, with the
attendant reduction in the trading liquidity of such class or series.

**Selection and Notice**

If less than all of any series of Senior Secured Notes are to be redeemed at any time, the Trustee will
select Notes for redemption on a pro rata basis (or, in the case of Global Notes, in accordance with the
Relevant Clearing System’s procedures), unless otherwise required by law or applicable stock exchange
or depository requirements. The Trustee will not be liable for any selections made by it in accordance
with this paragraph.

Notices of redemption will be delivered electronically or mailed by first-class mail, postage prepaid,
not less than 10 nor more than 60 days prior to the redemption date (except as permitted below), to
Holders of the Senior Secured Notes at their respective addresses as they appear on the registration
books of the Registrar with a copy to the Trustee and the relevant Paying Agent. In the case of Global
Notes, such notice of redemption may be instead sent in accordance with the rules and procedures of
the Relevant Clearing System (as applicable). On and after the redemption date, unless the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer defaults in the payment of the redemption price, interest ceases to accrue on the
Senior Secured Notes or the part of the Senior Secured Notes called for redemption.

If and for so long as the Senior Secured Notes are listed on the Official List of The International Stock
Exchange and to the extent the rules of the Authority so require, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will
notify the Authority of any such notice to the Holders and, in connection with any redemption, the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer will notify the Authority of any change in the principal amount of Senior
Secured Notes outstanding.

If any series of Senior Secured Notes is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates
to that series of Senior Secured Notes shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be
redeemed. In the case of a Definitive Registered Note, a new Definitive Registered Note in principal
amount equal to the unredeemed portion of any Definitive Registered Note redeemed in part will be
issued in the name of the Holder thereof upon cancellation of the original Definitive Registered Note.
In the case of a Global Note, an appropriate notation will be made on such Global Note (or otherwise
in accordance with the procedures of the Relevant Clearing System, as applicable) to decrease the
principal amount thereof to an amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof. Subject to the terms of
the applicable redemption notice, Notes called for redemption become due on the date fixed for
redemption. If such redemption is subject to the satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, the
related notice may, for the avoidance of doubt, state that, in the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s discretion,
the redemption date may be delayed until such time as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied or
waived (provided that in no event shall such date of redemption be delayed to a date later than 60 days
after the date on which such notice was sent, except that redemption notices may be mailed or sent in
accordance with the rules and procedures of the Relevant Clearing System (as applicable) more than 60

222


-----

days prior to a redemption date if the notice is issued in connection with a defeasance of the Senior
Secured Notes or a satisfaction and discharge of the Senior Secured Indenture), or such redemption may
not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions shall not have
been satisfied or waived by the redemption date, or by the redemption date so delayed.

**Redemption for Taxation Reasons**

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer may redeem the Senior Secured Notes in whole, but not in part, at any
time upon giving not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior written notice (which notice will be
irrevocable) at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, together with accrued
and unpaid interest, if any, to the date fixed for redemption (a “Tax Redemption Date”) (subject to the
right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest
payment date) and all Additional Amounts (as defined below under “—Withholding Taxes”), if any,
then due and which will become due on the Tax Redemption Date as a result of the redemption or
otherwise, if any, if the Senior Secured Notes Issuer determines in good faith that, as a result of:

(1) any change in, or amendment to, the law or treaties (or any regulations, official guidance or
rulings promulgated thereunder) of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined below) affecting
taxation; or

(2) any change in, or amendment to, the existing official position or the introduction of an official
position regarding the application, administration or interpretation of such laws, treaties,
regulations, official guidance or rulings (including by reason of a holding, judgment or order by
a court of competent jurisdiction or a change in published practice)

(each of the foregoing in clauses (1) and (2), a “Change in Tax Law”), a Payor (as defined below) is,
or on the next interest payment date in respect of the Senior Secured Notes would be, required to pay
Additional Amounts with respect to the Senior Secured Notes (but, in the case of a Guarantor, only if
the payment giving rise to such requirement cannot be made by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or
another Guarantor who can make such payment without the obligation to pay Additional Amounts),
and such obligation cannot be avoided by taking reasonable measures available to the Payor (including,
for the avoidance of doubt, the appointment of a new Paying Agent where this would be reasonable).
Such Change in Tax Law must be publicly announced and become effective on or after the Issue Date
(or if the applicable Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction became a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction on a date after
the Issue Date, such later date). The foregoing provisions shall apply mutatis mutandis to any successor
Person, after such successor Person becomes a party to the Senior Secured Indenture, with respect to a
change or amendment occurring after the time such successor Person becomes a party to the Senior
Secured Indenture.

Notice of redemption for taxation reasons will be given in accordance with the procedures described
under “—Selection and Notice”. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of redemption will be
given earlier than 90 days prior to the earliest date on which the Payor would be obligated to make such
payment of Additional Amounts if a payment in respect of the Senior Secured Notes were then due.
Prior to the giving of any notice of redemption of the Senior Secured Notes pursuant to the foregoing,
the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will deliver to the Trustee (a) an Officer’s Certificate stating that it is
entitled to effect such redemption and setting forth a statement of facts showing that the conditions
precedent to its right to so redeem have been satisfied and that the Payor cannot avoid its obligation to
pay Additional Amounts by taking reasonable measures available to it and (b) an opinion of an
independent tax counsel of recognized standing to the effect that the Payor has been or will become
obligated to pay Additional Amounts as a result of a Change in Tax Law. The Trustee will accept and
shall be entitled to rely on such Officer’s Certificate and opinion as sufficient evidence of the
satisfaction of the conditions precedent described above, without further inquiry, in which event it will
be conclusive and binding on the Holders.

223

**Withholding Taxes**

All payments made by or on behalf of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Guarantor (including any
successor entity) (each, a “Payor”) in respect of the Senior Secured Notes or with respect to any Note
Guarantee, as applicable, will be made free and clear of and without withholding or deduction for, or
on account of, any Taxes, unless the withholding or deduction of such Taxes is then required by law. If
any deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of:

(1) any jurisdiction from or through which payment on any such Senior Secured Note is made by or
on behalf of the Payor or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein
having the power to tax; or

(2) any other jurisdiction in which a Payor is incorporated or organized, engaged in business for tax
purposes, or otherwise considered to be a resident for tax purposes, or any political subdivision
or governmental authority thereof or therein having the power to tax

(each of clause (1) and (2), a “Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction”), will at any time be required by law to
be made from any payments made by or on behalf of the Payor with respect to any Senior Secured Note
or any Note Guarantee, as applicable, including payments of principal, redemption price, interest or
premium, if any, the Payor will pay (together with such payments) such additional amounts as may be
necessary in order that the net amounts received in respect of such payments, after such withholding or
deduction (including any such deduction or withholding from such additional amounts), will equal the
amounts which would have been received in respect of such payments on any such Senior Secured Note
or Note Guarantee, as applicable, in the absence of such withholding or deduction (the “Additional
**Amounts”); provided that no such Additional Amounts will be payable for or on account of:**

(1) any Taxes that would not have been so imposed but for the existence of any present or former
connection between the relevant Holder or beneficial owner (or between a fiduciary, settlor,
beneficiary, member, partner or shareholder of, or possessor of power over the relevant Holder
or beneficial owner, if the relevant Holder or beneficial owner is an estate, nominee, trust,
partnership, limited liability company or corporation) and the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction
(including, without limitation, being resident for tax purposes, or being a citizen or resident or
national of, or carrying on a business or maintaining a permanent establishment in, or being
physically present in, the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction) but excluding, in each case, any
connection arising solely from the acquisition, ownership or holding of such Senior Secured Note
or the receipt of any payment or the exercise or enforcement of rights under such Senior Secured
Note or Note Guarantee;

(2) any Tax that is imposed or withheld by reason of the failure by the Holder or the beneficial owner
of the Senior Secured Note to comply with a reasonable written request by the Payor addressed
to the Holder, after reasonable notice (at least 30 days before any such withholding or deduction
would be made), to provide certification, information, documents or other evidence concerning
the nationality, residence or identity of the Holder or such beneficial owner or to make any
declaration or similar claim or satisfy any other reporting requirement relating to such matters,
which is required by a law, statute, treaty, regulation or administrative practice of the Relevant
Taxing Jurisdiction as a precondition to exemption from, or reduction in the rate of deduction of,
all or part of such Tax but only to the extent the Holder or beneficial owner is legally entitled to
provide such certification or documentation;

(3) any Taxes, to the extent that such Taxes were imposed or withheld as a result of the presentation
of the Senior Secured Note for payment (where Notes are in the form of Definitive Registered
Notes and presentation is required) more than 30 days after the relevant payment is first made
available for payment to the Holder (except to the extent that the Holder would have been entitled
to Additional Amounts had the Senior Secured Note been presented on the last day of such 30day period);

(4) any Taxes pursuant to or in connection with the Dutch Withholding Tax Act 2021 (Wet
_bronbelasting 2021) as of the date of this Offering Memorandum;_

224


-----

(5) any Taxes that are payable otherwise than by deduction or withholding from a payment under or
with respect to the Senior Secured Notes or any Note Guarantee;

(6) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, excise, transfer, capital gains, personal property or similar tax,
assessment or other governmental charge;

(7) any Taxes imposed or withheld pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code, as of the
Issue Date (or any amended or successor version of such sections that are substantively
comparable), any regulations promulgated thereunder, any official interpretations thereof, any
intergovernmental agreement between a non-U.S. jurisdiction and the United States with respect
to the foregoing and any law, regulation, or official interpretation thereof implementing such
intergovernmental agreement, or any agreements entered into pursuant to Section 1471(b)(1) of
the Code; or

(8) any combination of the items (1) through (6) above.

In addition, no Additional Amounts shall be paid with respect to a Holder who is a fiduciary or a
partnership or any person other than the beneficial owner of the Senior Secured Notes, to the extent that
the beneficiary or settler with respect to such fiduciary, the member of such partnership or the beneficial
owner would not have been entitled to Additional Amounts had such beneficiary, settler, member or
beneficial owner directly held such Senior Secured Notes.

The Payor will (i) make any required withholding or deduction and (ii) remit the full amount deducted
or withheld to the relevant tax authority in the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction in accordance with
applicable law. The Payor will provide certified copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any
Taxes so deducted or withheld to each relevant tax authority in the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction
imposing such Taxes, or if such tax receipts are not available, certified copies of other reasonable
evidence of such payments as soon as reasonably practicable to the Trustee. Such copies shall be made
available to the Holders upon reasonable request and will be made available at the offices of the relevant
Paying Agent.

If any Payor is obligated to pay Additional Amounts under or with respect to any payment made on any
Senior Secured Note or any Note Guarantee, at least 30 days prior to the date of such payment, the
Payor will deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will
be payable and the amount estimated to be so payable and such other information necessary to enable
the relevant Paying Agent to pay Additional Amounts to Holders on the relevant payment date (unless
such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises less than 45 days prior to the relevant payment date,
in which case the Payor may deliver such Officer’s Certificate as promptly as practicable thereafter).
The Trustee shall be entitled to rely solely on such Officer’s Certificate as conclusive proof that such
payments are necessary.

Wherever in the Senior Secured Indenture, the Senior Secured Notes or this “Description of the Senior
_Secured Notes” there is mentioned, in any context:_

(1) the payment of principal;

(2) purchase prices in connection with a purchase of Senior Secured Notes;

(3) interest; or

(4) any other amount payable on or with respect to any of the Senior Secured Notes or any Note
Guarantee,

such reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such
context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.

The Payor will pay and reimburse the Holder upon demand for any cost, loss or liability that the Holder
incurs in relation to any present or future stamp, issue, registration, court or documentary Taxes, or
similar charges or levies (including any related interest or penalties with respect thereto) or any other
excise, property or similar Taxes or similar charges or levies (including any related interest or penalties
with respect thereto) that arise in a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction from the execution, delivery,
registration, or enforcement of the Senior Secured Notes, any Note Guarantee, the Senior Secured
Indenture or any other document or instrument in relation thereto (other than, in each case, in connection
with a transfer of the Senior Secured Notes after this issuance of Senior Secured Notes).

The foregoing obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Senior Secured
Indenture and any transfer by a Holder or beneficial owner, and will apply mutatis mutandis to any
jurisdiction in which any successor to a Payor is organized, engaged in business for tax purposes or
otherwise resident for tax purposes, or any jurisdiction from or through which any payment with respect
to the Senior Secured Notes (or any Note Guarantee) is made by or on behalf of such Payor, or any
political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein having the power to tax.

**Change of Control**

The Senior Secured Indenture will provided that if a Change of Control occurs, subject to the terms of
the covenant described under this heading “—Change of Control,” each Holder will have the right to
require the Senior Secured Notes Issuer to repurchase all or any part (equal, in the case of the Dollar
Senior Secured Notes, to U.S.$200,000 or integral multiples of U.S.$1,000 in excess thereof, or, in the
case of the Euro Senior Secured Notes, to €100,000 or integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof, if
applicable; provided that Notes of U.S.$200,000 or less, in the case of the Dollar Senior Secured Notes,
or €100,000 or less, in the case of the Euro Senior Secured Notes, may only be redeemed in whole and
not in part) of such Holder’s Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount
of the Senior Secured Notes repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if
any, to the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to
receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date); provided, however, that the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer shall not be obligated to repurchase any series of Senior Secured Notes as described under
this heading, “Change of Control,” in the event and to the extent that it has unconditionally exercised
its right to redeem all the Senior Secured Notes of such series and given notice of redemption as
described under “—Optional Redemption”.

Unless the Senior Secured Notes Issuer has exercised its right to redeem all the Senior Secured Notes
and given notice of redemption as described under “—Optional Redemption” and all conditions to such
redemption have been satisfied or waived, no later than the date that is 60 days after any Change of
Control, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will deliver (or cause to be delivered) a notice (the “Change
**of Control Offer”) electronically or by first-class mail, with a copy to the Trustee, to each Holder of**
the Senior Secured Notes to the address appearing in the security register or otherwise in accordance
with the procedures of the Relevant Clearing System, as applicable:

(1) stating that a Change of Control has occurred or may occur and that such Holder has the right to
require the Senior Secured Notes Issuer to purchase all or any part of such Holder’s Notes at a
purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of such Senior Secured Notes plus
accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the date of
purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on a record date to receive interest on the
relevant interest payment date) (the “Change of Control Payment”);

(2) stating the repurchase date (which shall be no earlier than 10 days nor later than 60 days from the
date such notice is mailed) (the “Change of Control Payment Date”);

(3) stating that any Senior Secured Note accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control
Offer will cease to accrue interest on the Change of Control Payment Date unless the Change of
Control Payment is not paid, and that any Senior Secured Notes or part thereof not tendered will
continue to accrue interest;

226


-----

(4) describing the circumstances and relevant facts regarding the transaction or transactions that
constitute the Change of Control;

(5) describing the procedures determined by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, consistent with the
Senior Secured Indenture, that a Holder must follow in order to have its Notes repurchased; and

(6) if such notice is delivered prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, stating that the Change
of Control Offer and/or the Change of Control Payment is conditional on the occurrence of such
Change of Control and, if applicable, that in the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s sole discretion,
the Change of Control Payment Date may be delayed until such time (including more than 60
days after the notice is sent) as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied or waived.

On the Change of Control Payment Date, if the Change of Control shall have occurred, the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer will, to the extent lawful:

(1) accept for payment all Senior Secured Notes or portions thereof properly tendered pursuant to the
Change of Control Offer;

(2) deposit with the relevant Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in
respect of all Senior Secured Notes so tendered;

(3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating the aggregate
principal amount of Senior Secured Notes or portions of the Senior Secured Notes being
purchased by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer in the Change of Control Offer.

A Holder willing to tender Notes into the Change of Control Offer shall notify its account manager of
its election (or otherwise take action in accordance with the procedures of the Relevant Clearing System
(as applicable)), who shall in turn notify the relevant Paying Agent and the Trustee of such Holder’s
election. Once such tender has been accepted by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and notified to the
relevant Paying Agent, the relevant Paying Agent shall promptly credit to the bank account of such
Holder the Change of Control Payment for such Senior Secured Notes so tendered and deduct the
corresponding amount of such Senior Secured Notes from such Holder’s account with the Relevant
Clearing System.

Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Senior Secured Indenture does not
contain provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Senior Secured Notes Issuer repurchase or
redeem the Senior Secured Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction.
Holders’ right to require the Senior Secured Notes Issuer to repurchase Notes upon the occurrence of a
Change of Control may deter a third party from seeking to acquire the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or
its Subsidiaries in a transaction that would constitute a Change of Control.

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change
of Control if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise
in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Senior Secured Indenture applicable to a Change
of Control Offer made by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and purchases all Senior Secured Notes
validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of
Control, conditioned upon the consummation of such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in
place providing for the Change of Control at the time the Change of Control Offer is made.

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Rule
14e-1 of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the
repurchase of Senior Secured Notes pursuant to this covenant. To the extent that the provisions of any
securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of the Senior Secured Indenture, the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be
deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control provisions of the Senior Secured
Indenture by virtue of such compliance.

227


-----

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s ability to repurchase Notes issued by it pursuant to a Change of
Control Offer may be limited by a number of factors. The Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement
will provide, and future credit agreements or other agreements to which the Senior Secured Notes Issuer
or any Subsidiary becomes party may provide that certain change of control events with respect to the
borrowers thereunder, or the Company, could require a prepayment, repayment or cancellation of such
facility and the Senior Notes will also require the issuer of the Senior Notes to make an offer to
repurchase the Senior Notes upon the occurrences of certain changes of control. If we experience a
change of control that requires a prepayment, repayment or cancellation under the Senior Secured Credit
Facilities Agreement, the Senior Notes or future Indebtedness, we could seek a waiver or seek to
refinance the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the Senior Notes and/or such other Indebtedness. In the
event we do not obtain such waiver or do not refinance the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the Senior
Notes and/or such other Indebtedness, such failure could cause a default thereunder and could result in
amounts outstanding thereunder to be declared due and payable. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders
of their right to require the Senior Secured Notes Issuer to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes could
cause a default under, or require a repurchase of, such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself
does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Senior Secured Notes Issuer. Finally, the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders upon a repurchase may be limited by
the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s then existing financial resources. There can be no assurance that
sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. See “Risk
_Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Note Guarantees and the Collateral—An Issuer may not be_
_able to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control. In addition, under certain circumstances, an_
_Issuer may have the right to purchase all outstanding Notes in connection with a tender offer, even if_
_certain holders do not consent to the tender”._

The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition, in one or a series of related transactions,
of all or substantially all the assets of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries
taken as a whole to specified other Persons. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting
the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all”
under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to
whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of
the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole. As a result, it may be
unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder may require the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes as described above.

The provisions of the Senior Secured Indenture relating to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s obligation
to make an offer to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be
waived or modified with the written consent of Holders of a majority in outstanding principal amount
of the Senior Secured Notes.

**Certain Covenants**

**_Limitation on Indebtedness_**
The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, Incur any Indebtedness
(including Acquired Indebtedness); provided, however, that the Company and any Restricted Subsidiary
may Incur Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) if after giving _pro forma effect to the_
Incurrence of such Indebtedness (including pro forma application of the proceeds thereof), (1) the Fixed
Charge Coverage Ratio for the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries would have been at least 2.0 to
1.0 or (2) the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio for the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries would
have been no greater than 7.5 to 1.0.

228

The first paragraph of this covenant will not prohibit the Incurrence of the following Indebtedness
(“Permitted Debt”):

Facility (including in respect of letters of credit or bankers’ acceptances issued or created
thereunder), and any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof and Guarantees in respect of
such Indebtedness in a maximum aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding not
exceeding:

(a) the sum of (i) U.S.$2,325 million, (ii) €965 million, (iii) AUD300 million and (iv) the
greater of U.S.$530 million and 75% of Consolidated EBITDA, plus

(b) the maximum amount of Indebtedness that is Senior Secured Indebtedness such that, after
giving pro forma effect to such Incurrence, the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage
Ratio for the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries would have been no greater than
5.25 to 1.0, plus

(c) the maximum amount of Indebtedness that is Junior Secured Indebtedness such that, after
giving pro forma effect to such Incurrence, the Consolidated Secured Net Leverage Ratio,
for the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries would have been no greater than 6.0 to
1.0, plus

(d) in the case of any refinancing of any Indebtedness permitted under this clause (1) or any
portion thereof, the aggregate amount of fees, underwriting discounts, premiums and other
costs and expenses Incurred in connection with such refinancing;

any Restricted Subsidiary, so long as the Incurrence of such Indebtedness is permitted to be
Incurred by another provision of this covenant; provided that, if the Indebtedness being guaranteed
is subordinated to the Senior Secured Notes or a Note Guarantee, then the guarantee must be
subordinated to the Senior Secured Notes or such Note Guarantee to the same extent as the
Indebtedness being guaranteed; or (b) without limiting the covenant described under “—
_Limitation on Liens”, Indebtedness arising by reason of any Lien granted by or applicable to such_
Person securing Indebtedness of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary so long as the
Incurrence of such Indebtedness is permitted under the terms of the Senior Secured Indenture;

(3) Indebtedness of the Company owing to and held by any Restricted Subsidiary or Indebtedness of
a Restricted Subsidiary owing to and held by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary (including
the Proceeds Loan); provided, however, that any subsequent issuance or transfer of Capital Stock
or any other event which results in any such Indebtedness being beneficially held by a Person
other than the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary and any sale or other transfer of any such
Indebtedness to a Person other than the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, shall be deemed, in
each case, to constitute an Incurrence of such Indebtedness not permitted by this clause (3) by the
Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be;

(4) (a) Indebtedness represented by (i) the Senior Secured Notes (other than any Additional Senior
Secured Notes) and the related Note Guarantees; and

(b) any Indebtedness of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries, including the Guarantees
of the Senior Notes (other than Indebtedness Incurred under the Senior Secured Credit
Facilities Agreement or Indebtedness described in clauses (1), (2), (3) or (4)(a) of this

the Senior Notes, outstanding on the Escrow Release Date), in each case, after giving pro
_forma effect to the Transactions;_

(4)(a), (4)(b) and (5) of this paragraph or Incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of this
covenant; and

(5) Indebtedness of any Person (i) outstanding on the date on which such Person becomes a Restricted
Subsidiary or is merged, consolidated, amalgamated or otherwise combined with (including
pursuant to any acquisition of assets and assumption of related liabilities) the Company or any
Restricted Subsidiary or (ii) Incurred to provide all or a portion of the funds utilized to
consummate the transaction or series of related transactions pursuant to which any Person became
a Restricted Subsidiary or was otherwise acquired by the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary;
_provided that, with respect to this clause (5), at the time of such acquisition or other transaction_
and after giving pro forma effect to such acquisition or other transaction and to the related
Incurrence of Indebtedness, either (x) the Company would have been able to Incur U.S.$1.00 of
additional Indebtedness pursuant to clause (1) or clause (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant
or the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio would not be less than it was immediately prior to giving
effect to such acquisition or other transaction and to the related Incurrence of Indebtedness, or the
Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio for the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries or (y) to the
extent such Indebtedness is Junior Secured Indebtedness, the Consolidated Secured Net Leverage
Ratio or (z) to the extent such Indebtedness is Senior Secured Indebtedness, the Consolidated
Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio, in each case, would not be greater than it was immediately
prior to giving effect to such acquisition or other transaction and to the related Incurrence of
Indebtedness;

(6) Indebtedness under Currency Agreements and Interest Rate Agreements not for speculative
purposes (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Company or
the Senior Secured Notes Issuer);

(7) Indebtedness consisting of (A) Capitalized Lease Obligations, mortgage financings, Purchase
Money Obligations or other financings, Incurred for the purpose of financing all or any part of the

Similar Business or (B) Indebtedness otherwise Incurred to finance the purchase, lease, rental or
cost of design, construction, installation or improvement of property (real or personal) or
equipment that is used or useful in a Similar Business, whether through the direct purchase of

refinances, replaces or refunds such Indebtedness, in an aggregate outstanding principal amount
which, when taken together with the principal amount of all other Indebtedness Incurred pursuant
to this clause (7) and then outstanding, will not exceed at any time (x) the greater of U.S.$135
million and 19% of Consolidated EBITDA _plus (y) the amount of any Capitalized Lease_
Obligations relating to any operating lease;

Subsidiary for the purpose of financing such acquisition or disposition); _provided that, in_
connection with a disposition, the maximum liability of the Company and its Restricted
Subsidiaries in respect of all such Indebtedness shall at no time exceed the gross proceeds,

however, that (i) any such Net Cash Proceeds that are so received or contributed shall be excluded
for purposes of making Restricted Payments under the first paragraph and clauses (1) and (10) of
the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” to

231


-----

the extent the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries Incur Indebtedness in reliance thereon and
(ii) any Net Cash Proceeds that are so received or contributed shall be excluded for purposes of
Incurring Indebtedness pursuant to this clause (14) to the extent the Company or any of its

(10) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted
_Payments” in reliance thereon; and_

(15) Indebtedness consisting of local lines of credit, bilateral facilities, working capital or overdraft

million and 50% of Consolidated EBITDA;

_provided that no more than the greater of U.S.$355 million and 50% of Consolidated EBITDA of_
Indebtedness at any time outstanding pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant may be Incurred
by a Restricted Subsidiary which is not a Guarantor (the “Non-Guarantor Debt Cap”).

For purposes of determining compliance with, and the outstanding principal amount of any particular
Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to and in compliance with, this covenant:

(1) in the event that Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the types of Indebtedness
described in the first and second paragraphs of this covenant, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, in
its sole discretion, will classify, and may from time to time reclassify, such item of Indebtedness
in one of the clauses of the second paragraph or the first paragraph of this covenant and
Indebtedness permitted by this covenant need not be permitted solely by reference to one provision
permitting such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one such provision and in part by
one or more other provisions of this covenant;

(2) all Indebtedness outstanding under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement on the Issue
Date or the Escrow Release Date shall be deemed initially Incurred under clause (1)(a) of the
second paragraph of this covenant, and such amounts under the Term Facilities (and any
Refinancing Indebtedness in respect of such Term Facilities) may not be reclassified;

(3) Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar
instruments relating to, or Liens securing, Indebtedness that is otherwise included in the
determination of a particular amount of Indebtedness shall not be included;

(4) if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments are
Incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being treated as Incurred pursuant to clause (1),
(7), (11) or (14) of the second paragraph of this covenant or the first paragraph of this covenant
and the letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments relate to other
Indebtedness, then such other Indebtedness shall not be included;

(5) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, or
Preferred Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary, will be equal to the greater of the maximum mandatory
redemption or repurchase price (not including, in either case, any redemption or repurchase
premium) or the liquidation preference thereof;

(6) Indebtedness permitted by this covenant need not be permitted solely by reference to one provision
permitting such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one such provision and in part by
one or more other provisions of this covenant permitting such Indebtedness;

(7) for the purposes of determining “Consolidated EBITDA” under this covenant, Consolidated
EBITDA shall be measured at the option of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer on the most recent
date on which new commitments are obtained or the date on which new Indebtedness is Incurred
(in the case of revolving facilities) or the date on which new Indebtedness is Incurred (in the case
of term facilities) and for the period of the most recent four consecutive fiscal quarters ending
prior to such date for which such internal consolidated financial statements of the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer or the SFA Reporting Entity are available; and

232


-----

(8) the amount of Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than the principal amount thereof will be
equal to the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined on the basis of IFRS.

Accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization
of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness, the payment
of dividends in the form of additional shares of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock or the
reclassification of commitments or obligations not treated as Indebtedness due to a change in IFRS will
not be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of the covenant described under this
“—Limitation on Indebtedness”. The amount of any Indebtedness outstanding as of any date shall be
(a) the accreted value thereof in the case of any Indebtedness issued with original issue discount and
(b) the principal amount, or liquidation preference thereof, in the case of any other Indebtedness.

If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such
Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary as of such date (and, if such
Indebtedness is not permitted to be Incurred as of such date under the covenant described under this
“—Limitation on Indebtedness,” the Senior Secured Notes Issuer shall be in Default of this covenant).

For purposes of determining compliance with any U.S. dollar-denominated restriction on the Incurrence
of Indebtedness, the Dollar Equivalent of the principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in another
currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such
Indebtedness was Incurred, in the case of term Indebtedness, or first committed or first Incurred
(whichever yields the lower Dollar Equivalent), in the case of Indebtedness Incurred under a revolving
credit facility; _provided that (a) if such Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness_
denominated in a currency other than U.S. dollars, and such refinancing would cause the applicable
U.S. dollar-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate
in effect on the date of such refinancing, such U.S. dollar-denominated restriction shall be deemed not
to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not
exceed the amount set forth in clause (2) of the definition of Refinancing Indebtedness; (b) the Dollar
Equivalent of the principal amount of any such Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date shall be
calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the Issue Date; and (c) if any such
Indebtedness that is denominated in a different currency is subject to a Currency Agreement (with
respect to the U.S. dollar) covering principal amounts payable on such Indebtedness, the amount of
such Indebtedness expressed in U.S. dollar will be adjusted to take into account the effect of such
agreement.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the
Company or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be
exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of
any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the
Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to
the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of
such refinancing.

**_Limitation on Restricted Payments_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, directly or indirectly, to:

(1) declare or pay any dividend or make any other payment or distribution on or in respect of the
Company’s or any Restricted Subsidiary’s Capital Stock (including any payment in connection
with any merger or consolidation involving the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries)
except:

(a) dividends or distributions payable in Capital Stock of the Company (other than Disqualified
Stock) or in options, warrants or other rights to purchase such Capital Stock of the
Company or in Subordinated Shareholder Funding; and

233


-----

(2) except in the case of a Permitted Asset Swap or the Retail Transaction, at least 75% of the
consideration the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary receives in respect of such Asset

such Asset Disposition, of securities, notes or other obligations received in consideration
of such Asset Disposition);

(b) Cash Equivalents;

(c) the assumption by the purchaser of (x) any liabilities of the Company or its Restricted
Subsidiaries recorded on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet or the notes thereto

Company nor any of the Restricted Subsidiaries remains obligated in respect of such
liabilities or (y) Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted
Subsidiary as a result of such Asset Disposition, if the Company and each other Restricted

242

Disposition;

of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or such Guarantor;

(f) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by the Company or any Restricted

EBITDA (with the fair market value of each issue of Designated Non-Cash Consideration
being measured at the time received and without giving effect to subsequent changes in
value); or

(g) a combination of the consideration specified in clauses (a) through (f) of this clause (2).

If the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary consummates an Asset Disposition, the Net Available
Cash of the Asset Disposition, within 630 days of the later of (i) the date of the consummation of such
Asset Disposition and (ii) the receipt of such Net Available Cash, may be used by the Company or such
Restricted Subsidiary to:

(1) (i) prepay, repay, purchase or redeem any series of Senior Secured Notes and/or any other Pari
Passu Indebtedness (other than Indebtedness owed to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary),
with respect to such other Pari Passu Indebtedness, at a price of no more than the principal amount
of such applicable Indebtedness, _plus accrued and unpaid interest, Additional Amounts and_
applicable prepayment or redemption premium, if any, to the date of such prepayment, repayment,
purchase or redemption and with respect to any Senior Secured Notes, at a price of no less than
100% of the principal amount of such Senior Secured Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest and
Additional Amounts, if any, to the date of such prepayment, repayment, purchase or redemption;
_provided that the Senior Secured Notes Issuer shall prepay, repay, purchase or redeem Pari Passu_
Indebtedness (other than the Senior Secured Notes) pursuant to this sub-clause (i) only if the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer makes (at such time or in compliance with this covenant) an offer to
Holders to purchase their Senior Secured Notes in accordance with the provisions set forth below
for an Asset Disposition Offer for an aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Notes equal
to the proportion that (x) the total aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Notes outstanding
bears to (y) the total aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Notes outstanding _plus the_
total aggregate principal amount outstanding of such other Pari Passu Indebtedness; or (ii) prepay,
repay, purchase or redeem any Senior Secured Indebtedness, Indebtedness of a Restricted

Notes Issuer or a Guarantor or Indebtedness owed to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary);

(2) purchase any series of Senior Secured Notes pursuant to an offer to all Holders of such series of
Senior Secured Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to at least 100% of the principal amount
thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including,
the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive
interest due on the relevant interest payment date) or by making an Asset Disposition Offer to all
Holders of the Senior Secured Notes (in accordance with the procedures set out below);

(3) invest in any Replacement Assets;

243

(4) acquire all or substantially all the assets of, or any Capital Stock of, another Similar Business, if,
after giving effect to any such acquisition of Capital Stock, the Similar Business is or becomes a

(5) make a capital expenditure;

(6) acquire other assets (other than Capital Stock and cash or Cash Equivalents) that are used or useful
in a Similar Business;

(7) consummate any combination of the foregoing; or

(8) enter into a binding commitment to apply the Net Available Cash pursuant to clauses (1) through
(7) or of this paragraph or a combination thereof; provided that a binding commitment shall be
treated as a permitted application of the Net Available Cash from the date of such commitment
until the earlier of (x) the date on which such investment is consummated and (y) the 180th day
following the expiration of the aforementioned 630-day period, if the investment has not been
consummated by that date.

The amount of such Net Available Cash not so used as set forth in this paragraph constitutes “Excess
**Proceeds”.** Pending the final application of any such Net Available Cash, the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer may temporarily reduce revolving credit borrowings or otherwise invest such Net Available Cash
in any manner that is not prohibited by the terms of the Senior Secured Indenture. On the 631[st] day after
an Asset Disposition or such earlier time if the Senior Secured Notes Issuer elects, if the aggregate
amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds the greater of U.S.$110 million and 15% of Consolidated EBITDA,
the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will be required to make within 30 Business Days thereof an offer (an
“Asset Disposition Offer”) to all Holders and, to the extent the Senior Secured Notes Issuer elects, to
all holders of other outstanding Pari Passu Indebtedness, to purchase the maximum principal amount of
Senior Secured Notes and any such Pari Passu Indebtedness to which the Asset Disposition Offer
applies that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds, at an offer price in respect of the Senior
Secured Notes in an amount equal to (and, in the case of any such Pari Passu Indebtedness, an offer
price of no more than) 100% of the principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes and 100% of the
principal amount of such Pari Passu Indebtedness, in each case, plus accrued and unpaid interest,
Additional Amounts and applicable prepayment or redemption premium, if any, to, but not including,
the date of purchase, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Senior Secured Indenture or the
agreements governing such Pari Passu Indebtedness, as applicable, and in the case of the Senior Secured
Notes, in minimum denominations of, in the case of the Dollar Senior Secured Notes, U.S.$200,000
and in integral multiples of U.S.$1,000 in excess thereof, and in the case of the Euro Senior Secured
Notes, €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof.

To the extent that the aggregate amount of Senior Secured Notes so validly tendered and not properly
withdrawn pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer and any such Pari Passu Indebtedness so redeemed
or repaid is less than the Excess Proceeds, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer may use any remaining
Excess Proceeds for general corporate purposes or any other purpose not prohibited by the Senior
Secured Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes surrendered in any
Asset Disposition Offer by Holders and such other Pari Passu Indebtedness surrendered by holders or
lenders, collectively, exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Excess Proceeds shall be allocated
among the Senior Secured Notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness to be repaid or purchased on a pro
_rata basis on the basis (or, in the case of Global Notes, in accordance with the procedures of the relevant_
clearing system) of the aggregate principal amount of tendered Notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness.
For the purposes of calculating the principal amount of any such Indebtedness not denominated in U.S.
dollar, such Indebtedness shall be calculated by converting any such principal amounts into their Dollar
Equivalent determined as of a date selected by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer that is within the Asset

244


-----

Disposition Offer Period (as defined below). Upon completion of any Asset Disposition Offer, the
amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero.

To the extent that any portion of Net Available Cash payable in respect of the Senior Secured Notes is
denominated in a currency other than the currency in which the Senior Secured Notes are denominated,
the amount thereof payable in respect of such Senior Secured Notes shall not exceed the net amount of
funds in the currency in which such Senior Secured Notes are denominated that is actually received by
the Senior Secured Notes Issuer upon converting such portion of the Net Available Cash into such
currency.

The Asset Disposition Offer, insofar as it relates to the Senior Secured Notes, will remain open for a
period of not less than 20 Business Days following its commencement (the “Asset Disposition Offer
**Period”). No later than five Business Days after the termination of the Asset Disposition Offer Period**
(the “Asset Disposition Purchase Date”), the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will purchase the principal
amount of Senior Secured Notes and, to the extent it elects, Pari Passu Indebtedness required to be
purchased by it pursuant to this covenant (the “Asset Disposition Offer Amount”) or, if less than the
Asset Disposition Offer Amount has been so validly tendered, all Senior Secured Notes and Pari Passu
Indebtedness validly tendered in response to the Asset Disposition Offer. On or before the Asset
Disposition Purchase Date, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will, to the extent lawful, accept for
payment, on a pro rata basis to the extent necessary (or, in the case of Global Notes, in accordance with
the procedures of the relevant clearing system), the Asset Disposition Offer Amount of Senior Secured
Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness or portions of Senior Secured Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so
validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Asset Disposition Offer, or if less than the
Asset Disposition Offer Amount has been validly tendered and not properly withdrawn, all Senior
Secured Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn and, in the
case of the Senior Secured Notes, in minimum denominations of, in the case of the Dollar Senior
Secured Notes, U.S.$200,000 and in integral multiples of U.S.$1,000 in excess thereof, and in the case
of the Euro Senior Secured Notes, €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer shall be permitted to delay the
repayment, prepayment or purchase of Pari Passu Indebtedness until the last day of the first interest
period ended not less than 5 Business Days after the termination of the Asset Disposition Offer Period.

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer will deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that such
Senior Secured Notes or portions thereof were accepted for payment by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer
in accordance with the terms of this covenant. The relevant Paying Agent shall deliver to the Holders
of the relevant Senior Secured Notes the purchase price of such Senior Secured Notes validly tendered
and not withdrawn and arrange for the deduction of the appropriate amounts of such Senior Secured
Notes from such Holders’ accounts with the Relevant Clearing System (as applicable). Any Senior
Secured Note not so accepted will be promptly mailed or delivered (or transferred by book-entry or
otherwise in accordance with the procedures of the Relevant Clearing System) by the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer to the Holder thereof.

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of
Section 14e-1 of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the
repurchase of Senior Secured Notes pursuant to the Senior Secured Indenture. To the extent that the
provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of this covenant, the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be
deemed to have breached its obligations under the Senior Secured Indenture by virtue of such
compliance.

Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this covenant, to the extent that (x) a contribution or
distribution of any or all the Net Available Cash of any Asset Disposition by a Subsidiary to the
Company or to a Restricted Subsidiary (to the extent necessary to comply with this covenant) is
prohibited or delayed by applicable local law (including financial assistance and corporate benefit

245

restrictions and fiduciary and statutory duties of the relevant directors), (y) a contribution or distribution
of any or all the Net Available Cash of any Asset Disposition by a Subsidiary to the Company or to a
Restricted Subsidiary (to the extent necessary to comply with this covenant) could result in material
adverse Tax consequences, as determined by the Company or Issuer in their sole discretion or (z) a
contribution or distribution of any or all the Net Available Cash of any Asset Disposition by a Subsidiary
to the Company or to a Restricted Subsidiary (to the extent necessary to comply with this covenant) is
subject to a contractual encumbrance or restriction affecting the distribution and such encumbrance or
restriction is not prohibited by the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restrictions on
_Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries,” the portion of such Net Available Cash so affected will not_
be required to be applied in compliance with this covenant.

**_Limitation on Affiliate Transactions_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly,
enter into or conduct any transaction or series of related transactions (including the purchase, sale, lease
or exchange of any property or the rendering of any service) with any Affiliate of the Company (any
such transaction or series of related transactions being an “Affiliate Transaction”) involving aggregate
value in excess of the greater of U.S.$55 million and 7.5% of Consolidated EBITDA unless:

(1) the terms of such Affiliate Transaction taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the
Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that could be obtained in

of the agreement providing for such transaction in arm’s-length dealings with a Person who is not
such an Affiliate; and

(2) in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves an aggregate value in excess of the greater of
U.S.$75 million and 10% of Consolidated EBITDA, the terms of such transaction or series of

of the Reporting Entity, a report containing a description of such event.

The Company shall have the option at any time to provide the reports set forth in clauses (1) and (2) above by
furnishing such financial information relating to (i) any Parent Entity consolidating reporting at its level or (ii) the
Company and its Subsidiaries. In addition, following an Initial Public Offering of the Capital Stock of an IPO
Entity and/or the listing of such Capital Stock on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange (or one or more
of the equivalent markets of an international stock exchange), the requirements of clauses (1), (2) and (3) above
shall be considered to have been fulfilled if the IPO Entity complies with the reporting requirements of such stock
exchange; provided that the IPO Entity shall disclose adjusted EBITDA. The Company, the SFA Reporting Entity
or such other entity the reports of which are delivered pursuant to this paragraph is referred to as the “Reporting
**Entity”.**

The requirement to furnish any of the reports required pursuant to clauses (1), (2) and (3) above may be satisfied
by the posting of such reports within the time periods specified above on Smartroom, Intralinks or any comparable
password protected online data system requiring user identification and a confidentiality acknowledgement (the
“Secured System”). If the Company uses the Secured System to satisfy such requirements, it shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to make available any password or other login information relating to the Secured
System to Holders, bone fide prospective investors (each, a “Prospective Investor”), security analysts who have
certified to the Company that they are reputable security analysts employed by a reputable financial institution
who regularly cover or intend to cover the Company and the Senior Secured Notes (each, a “Security Analyst”)
and market makers who have certified to the Company that they are reputable market makers who regularly make
or intend to make a market in the Senior Secured Notes (each, a “Market Maker”), and shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to make available on an Investor Relations page on its external website contact information for
being provided access to the Secured System to any Holders, Prospective Investors, Security Analysts or Market
Makers and reasonably promptly comply with any such requests for access to the Secured System to the extent
provided for herein.

Any Person (other than the Trustee) who requests or accesses such financial information required by this covenant
will be required to represent to the Company (to the reasonable good faith satisfaction of the Company) that:

(i) it is a Holder, a Beneficial Owner of the Senior Secured Notes, a Prospective Investor, a Market Maker
or Securities Analyst;

(ii) it will keep such information confidential and will not communicate the information to any Person; and

(iii) it is not a Person (which includes such Person’s Affiliates) that (1) is principally engaged in a Similar
Business or (2) derives a significant portion of its revenue from operating a Similar Business.

In addition, to the extent not satisfied by the above, the Company shall furnish to the Holders and to prospective
investors, upon the request of such parties, any information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4)
under the Securities Act for so long as the Senior Secured Notes are not freely transferable under the Exchange
Act by persons who are not “affiliates” under the Securities Act.

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, failure by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer to comply with any
of its obligations under this covenant for purposes of clause (3) under “—Events of Default” will not constitute an
Event of Default thereunder until 120 days after the receipt of the written notice delivered thereunder.

All financial statement information shall be prepared on a basis consistent with IFRS as in effect on the
date of such report or financial statement (or otherwise on the basis of IFRS as then in effect) and on a
consistent basis for the periods presented, except as may otherwise be described in such information;
_provided, however, that the reports set forth in clauses (1), (2) and (3) above may, in the event of a_
change in IFRS, present earlier periods on a basis that applied to such periods. To the extent comparable
prior period financial information of the Reporting Entity does not exist, the comparable prior period
financial information of Ardonagh Midco 2 plc and its Subsidiaries or The Ardonagh Group Limited
and its Subsidiaries, if available, may be provided in lieu thereof. No report need include separate

250


-----

financial statements for any Subsidiaries of the Company. In addition, the reports set forth above will
not be required to contain any reconciliation to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

At any time that any of the Company’s subsidiaries are Unrestricted Subsidiaries and any such
Unrestricted Subsidiary or a group of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, constitutes a
Significant Subsidiary of the Company, then the quarterly and annual financial information required by
the first paragraph of this covenant will include a reasonably detailed presentation, either on the face of
the financial statements or in the footnotes thereto, of the financial condition and results of operations
of the Reporting Entity and the Restricted Subsidiaries separate from the financial condition and results
of operations of the Unrestricted Subsidiaries.

All reports provided pursuant to this covenant shall be made in the English language.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that (i) the Company or the Senior Secured Notes Issuer
becomes subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, or elects
to comply with such provisions, for so long as it continues to file the reports required by Section 13(a)
with the SEC, or (ii) the Company elects to provide to the Trustee reports which, if filed with the SEC,
would satisfy (in the good faith judgment of the Company) the reporting requirements of Section 13(a)
or 15(d) of the Exchange Act (other than the provision of U.S. GAAP information, certifications,
exhibits or information as to internal controls and procedures), for so long as it elects, the Company
will make available to the Trustee such annual reports, information, documents and other reports that
the Company is, or would be, required to file with the SEC pursuant to such Section 13(a) or 15(d) or,
the Company will be deemed to have furnished such reports referred to above to the Trustee and the
Holders if it has filed (or, in the case of an Item 2.02 or Item 7.01 Form 8-K, furnished) such reports
with the SEC and such reports are publicly available. Upon complying with the foregoing requirement,
the Company will be deemed to have complied with the provisions contained in this covenant.

**_Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status_**

If on any date following the Issue Date, the Senior Secured Notes have achieved Investment Grade
Status and no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing (a “Suspension Event”), then,
beginning on that day and continuing until such time, if any, at which the Senior Secured Notes cease
to have Investment Grade Status (the “Reversion Date”), the provisions of the Senior Secured Indenture
summarized under the following captions will not apply to the Senior Secured Notes:

(1) “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”;

(2) “—Limitation on Indebtedness”;

(3) “—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries”;

(4) “—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions”;

(5) “—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock”;

(6) “—Limitation on Additional Guarantees”;

(7) the provisions of clause (3) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Merger and
_Consolidation—The Senior Secured Notes Issuer”; and_

(8)  the provisions of clause (3) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Merger and
_Consolidation—The Company.”_

And, in each case, any related default provision of the Senior Secured Indenture will cease to be
effective and will not be applicable to the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries.

Such covenants and any related default provisions will again apply according to their terms from the
first day on which a Suspension Event ceases to be in effect. Such covenants will not, however, be of

251


-----

any effect with regard to actions of the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries properly taken
during the continuance of the Suspension Event, and no action taken prior to the Reversion Date will
constitute a Default or Event of Default. The covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted
_Payments” will be interpreted as if it has been in effect since the date of the Senior Secured Indenture_
but not during the continuance of the Suspension Event. On the Reversion Date, all Indebtedness
Incurred during the continuance of the Suspension Event will be deemed to have been outstanding on
the Issue Date or the Escrow Release Date (as the case may be), so that it is classified as permitted under
clause (4)(b) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness.”
In addition, the Senior Secured Indenture will also permit, without causing a Default or Event of
Default, the Company or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to honor any contractual commitments or
take actions in the future after any date on which the Senior Secured Notes cease to have an Investment
Grade Status as long as the contractual commitments were entered into during the Suspension Event
and not in anticipation of the Senior Secured Notes no longer having an Investment Grade Status. The
Senior Secured Notes Issuer shall notify the Trustee in writing that the conditions set forth in the first
paragraph under this caption have been satisfied; provided that no such notification shall be a condition
for the suspension of the covenants described under this caption to be effective. There can be no
assurance that the Senior Secured Notes will ever achieve or maintain an Investment Grade Status.

**_Impairment of Security Interest_**

The Company and the Parent shall not, and the Company shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to,
take or knowingly or negligently omit to take any action that would have the result of materially
impairing the Security Interest with respect to the Collateral (it being understood, subject to the
paragraph below, that the Incurrence of Permitted Collateral Liens shall under no circumstances be
deemed to materially impair the Security Interests with respect to the Collateral) for the benefit of the
Trustee and the Holders, and the Company and the Parent shall not, and the Company shall not permit
any Restricted Subsidiary to, grant to any Person other than the Security Agent, for the benefit of the
Trustee and the Holders and the other beneficiaries described in the Security Documents and the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, any interest whatsoever in any of
the Collateral.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the Company, the Parent and the Restricted Subsidiaries may Incur
Permitted Collateral Liens, (ii) the Collateral may be discharged and released in accordance with the
Senior Secured Indenture, the applicable Security Documents or the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement; (iii) the applicable Security Documents may be amended from time
to time to cure any ambiguity, mistake, omission, defect, error or inconsistency therein; (iv) the
Company, the Parent and the Restricted Subsidiaries may discharge and release Security Interests with
respect to the Collateral in connection with the implementation of a Permitted Reorganization; and
(v) the Security Interests, and the related Security Documents may be (A) amended, extended, renewed,
restated, supplemented or otherwise modified or released followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien
of at least equivalent ranking over the same assets or (B) otherwise amended, extended, renewed,
restated, supplemented or otherwise modified in any manner that does not materially adversely after the
Holders; provided, however, that in the case of clause (v) above, the Security Documents may not be
amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, released or modified or replaced; unless,
contemporaneously with any such action, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer delivers to the Trustee either
(1) a solvency opinion, in form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, from an Independent Financial
Advisor confirming the solvency of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole or of the Parent
and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole (as applicable), and of the person granting such Security Interest,
in each case, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal,
restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement, (2) a certificate from the Board of
Directors of the relevant Person, in form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, which confirms the
solvency of the person granting such Security Interest, after giving effect to any transactions related to
such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement, or
(3) an Opinion of Counsel, in form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, confirming that, after giving

252


-----

effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement,
release, modification or replacement, the Lien or Liens created under the Security Documents, as so
amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, released, modified or replaced, are valid Liens
not otherwise subject to any limitation, imperfection or new hardening period, in equity or at law, to
which such Lien or Liens were not otherwise subject immediately prior to such amendment, extension,
renewal, restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement. In the event that the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer complies with the requirements of this covenant, the Trustee and the Security
Agent shall (subject to each of the Trustee and the Security Agent being indemnified and secured to its
satisfaction) consent to such amendments without the need for instructions from the Holders and the
Security Agent (and if required the Trustee) shall enter into any documents or take any such actions in
connection therewith.

**_Limitation on Additional Guarantees_**

No Restricted Subsidiary shall Guarantee the Indebtedness outstanding under the Senior Secured Credit
Facilities Agreement, any Credit Facility that replaces the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement
or any Public Debt, in each case, of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or a Guarantor unless such
Restricted Subsidiary is or becomes a Guarantor within 20 Business Days of the date on which such
Guarantee is Incurred and, if necessary, executes and delivers to the Trustee a supplemental indenture
in the form attached to the Senior Secured Indenture pursuant to which such Restricted Subsidiary will
provide a Note Guarantee; provided, however, that such Restricted Subsidiary shall not be obligated to
become such a Guarantor to the extent and for so long as the Incurrence of such Note Guarantee is
contrary to the Agreed Security Principles or could give rise to or result in: (1) any breach or violation
of statutory limitations, corporate benefit, financial assistance, fraudulent preference, thin capitalization
rules, capital maintenance rules, guidance and coordination rules or the laws, rules or regulations (or
analogous restriction) of any applicable jurisdiction; (2) any risk or liability for the officers, directors
or (except in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership) shareholders of such Restricted
Subsidiary (or, in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership, directors or shareholders of
the partners of such partnership); (3) any cost, expense, liability or obligation other than reasonable outof-pocket expenses or (4) is inconsistent with the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement. At the option of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, any Note Guarantee may
contain limitations on Guarantor liability to the extent reasonably necessary to recognize certain
defenses generally available to guarantors (including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or
transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose, capital maintenance or similar
laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other considerations under
applicable law.

Future Note Guarantees granted pursuant to this provision shall be released as set forth under “—
_Releases of the Note Guarantees.” A Note Guarantee of a future Guarantor may also be released at the_
option of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer if at the date of such release there is no Indebtedness of such
Guarantor outstanding which was Incurred after the Issue Date and which could not have been Incurred
in compliance with the Senior Secured Indenture if such Guarantor had not been designated as a
Guarantor. The Trustee and the Security Agent shall execute any documents or each take all necessary
actions, including the granting of releases or waivers under the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement, to effectuate any release of a Note Guarantee reasonably requested
by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer in accordance with these provisions, subject to each of the Trustee
and the Security Agent being indemnified and secured to its satisfaction.

**_Additional Intercreditor Agreements_**

The Senior Secured Indenture will provide that, at the request of the Company or the Parent, in
connection with the Incurrence by the Company or its Restricted Subsidiaries of any (1) Indebtedness
permitted pursuant to the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” or (2) any
Refinancing Indebtedness in respect of Indebtedness referred to in the foregoing clause (1) the Parent,

253


-----

the Company, the relevant Restricted Subsidiaries, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall (without
the consent of the Holders) enter into with the holders of such Indebtedness (or their duly authorized
Representatives) an intercreditor agreement (an “Additional Intercreditor Agreement”) or a
restatement, amendment or other modification of the existing Intercreditor Agreement on substantially
the same terms as the Intercreditor Agreement (or terms not materially less favorable to the Holders
(taken as a whole)), including containing substantially the same terms with respect to release of Note
Guarantees and priority and release of the Security Interests; provided that such Additional Intercreditor
Agreement will not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or Security Agent or, in the opinion
of the Trustee or Security Agent, as applicable, adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or
immunities of the Trustee or Security Agent under the Senior Secured Indenture or the Intercreditor
Agreement.

The Senior Secured Indenture also will provide that, at the direction of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer
or the Company and without the consent of Holders, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall from time
to time enter into one or more amendments to any Intercreditor Agreement to: (1) cure any ambiguity,
omission, defect, error or inconsistency of any such agreement, (2) increase the amount or types of
Indebtedness covered by any such agreement that may be Incurred by the Company or any Restricted
Subsidiary that is subject to any such agreement (including, with respect to any Intercreditor Agreement
or Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the addition of provisions relating to new Indebtedness ranking
junior in right of payment to the Senior Secured Notes), (3) add Restricted Subsidiaries to the
Intercreditor Agreement or an Additional Intercreditor Agreement, (4) further secure the Senior Secured
Notes or any of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities as is otherwise not prohibited by the Senior Secured
Indenture (including Additional Senior Secured Notes or Incremental Facilities), make provision for
equal and ratable pledges of the Collateral to secure Additional Senior Secured Notes or Incremental
Facilities, (6) implement any Permitted Collateral Liens, (7) amend the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement in accordance with the terms thereof or (8) make any other change
to any such agreement that does not materially adversely affect the Holders (taken as a whole). In
formulating its opinion on such matters, the Trustee shall be entitled to request and rely absolutely on
such evidence as it deems appropriate, including an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel.
Neither the Senior Secured Notes Issuer nor the Company shall otherwise direct the Trustee or the
Security Agent to enter into any amendment to any Intercreditor Agreement without the consent of the
Holders of the majority in aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes then outstanding,
except as otherwise permitted below under “—Amendments and Waivers”, and the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer and the Company may only direct the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into any
amendment to the extent such amendment does not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or
Security Agent or, in the opinion of the Trustee or Security Agent, adversely affect their respective
rights, duties, liabilities or immunities under the Senior Secured Indenture or the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The Senior Secured Indenture will also provide that, in relation to any Intercreditor Agreement or
Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the Trustee (and the Security Agent, if applicable) shall consent on
behalf of the Holders to the payment, repayment, purchase, repurchase, defeasance, acquisition,
retirement or redemption of any obligations subordinated to the Senior Secured Notes thereby; provided
that such transaction would comply with the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted
_Payments” and the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement._

The Senior Secured Indenture will also provide that each Holder, by accepting a Senior Secured Note,
shall be deemed to have agreed to and accepted the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement
or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (whether then entered into or entered into in the future
pursuant to the provisions described herein), and to have directed the Trustee and the Security Agent to
enter into any such Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

**Merger and Consolidation**

**_The Company_**

The Company will not, directly or indirectly, consolidate with or merge with or into, or assign, convey,
transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all its assets as an entirety or substantially as
an entirety, in one transaction or a series of related transactions to, any Person, unless:

(1) either the Company is the surviving entity, or the resulting, surviving or transferee Person (the
“Successor Company”) will be a Person organized and existing under the laws of any member
state of the European Union, the United Kingdom, Jersey, the Cayman Islands, any State of the
United States of America or the District of Columbia, Canada or any province of Canada and the
Successor Company (if not the Company) will expressly assume (a) by supplemental indenture,
executed and delivered to the Trustee, in form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, all the
obligations of the Company under the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Indenture and
(b) all obligations of the Company under the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement, the Proceeds Loan and the Security Documents, as applicable;

(2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness that becomes
an obligation of the Successor Company or any Subsidiary of the Successor Company as a result
of such transaction as having been Incurred by the Successor Company or such Subsidiary at the
time of such transaction), no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing;

(3) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, either (a) the Company or the Successor
Company would be able to Incur at least an additional U.S.$1.00 of Indebtedness pursuant to
clause (1) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness”
or (b) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the Company or the Successor Company for the most
recently ended four full fiscal quarters for which financial statements are available immediately
preceding the date on which the transaction is consummated would not be less than it was
immediately prior to giving effect to such transaction; and

(4) the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of
Counsel, each to the effect that such consolidation, merger or transfer and such supplemental
indenture (if any is required in connection with such transaction) comply with the Senior Secured
Indenture; _provided that in giving an Opinion of Counsel, counsel may rely on an Officer’s_
Certificate as to any matters of fact.

Without prejudice to clause (3) in the immediately preceding paragraph, any Indebtedness that becomes
an obligation of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary (or that is deemed to be Incurred by any
Restricted Subsidiary that becomes a Restricted Subsidiary) as a result of any such transaction
undertaken in compliance with this covenant, and any Refinancing Indebtedness with respect thereto,
shall be deemed to have been Incurred in compliance with the covenant described under “—Limitation
_on Indebtedness”._

The Successor Company will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power
of, the Company under the Senior Secured Indenture and the Senior Secured Notes.

There is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law.
Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular
transaction would involve “all or substantially all” of the properties or assets of a Person.

**_The Senior Secured Notes Issuer_**

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer will not, directly or indirectly, consolidate with or merge with or into,
or assign, convey, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all its assets as an entirety
or substantially as an entirety, in one transaction or a series of related transactions to, any Person, unless:

(1) either the Senior Secured Notes Issuer is the surviving entity, or the resulting, surviving or
transferee Person (the “Successor Issuer”) will be a Person organized and existing under the laws
of any member state of the European Union, the United Kingdom, Jersey, the Cayman Islands,
any State of the United States of America or the District of Columbia, Canada or any province of
Canada and the Successor Company (if not the Senior Secured Notes Issuer) will expressly assume
(a) by supplemental indenture, executed and delivered to the Trustee, in form reasonably
satisfactory to the Trustee, all the obligations of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer under the Senior
Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Indenture and (b) all obligations of the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer under the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the
Senior Secured Escrow Agreement, the Proceeds Loan and the Security Documents, as applicable;

(2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness that becomes
an obligation of the Successor Issuer or any Subsidiary of the Successor Issuer as a result of such
transaction as having been Incurred by the Successor Issuer or such Subsidiary at the time of such
transaction), no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing;

(3) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, either (a) the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or
the Successor Issuer would be able to Incur at least an additional U.S.$1.00 of Indebtedness
pursuant to clause (1) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on
_Indebtedness” or (b) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or the_
Successor Issuer for the most recently ended four full fiscal quarters for which financial statements
are available immediately preceding the date on which the transaction is consummated would not
be less than it was immediately prior to giving effect to such transaction; and

(4) the Senior Secured Notes Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an
Opinion of Counsel, each to the effect that such consolidation, merger or transfer and such
supplemental indenture (if any is required in connection with such transaction) comply with the
Senior Secured Indenture; provided that in giving an Opinion of Counsel, counsel may rely on an
Officer’s Certificate as to any matters of fact.

Without prejudice to clause (3) in the immediately preceding paragraph, any Indebtedness that becomes
an obligation of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary (or that is deemed to be Incurred by any
Restricted Subsidiary that becomes a Restricted Subsidiary) as a result of any such transaction
undertaken in compliance with this covenant, and any Refinancing Indebtedness with respect thereto,
shall be deemed to have been Incurred in compliance with the covenant described under “—Limitation
_on Indebtedness”._

The Successor Issuer will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power
of, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer under the Senior Secured Indenture and the Senior Secured Notes.

There is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law.

**_The Subsidiary Guarantors_**

No Subsidiary Guarantor (other than a Subsidiary Guarantor whose Note Guarantee is to be released in
accordance with the terms of the Senior Secured Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement) may:

(1) consolidate with or merge with or into any Person (whether or not such Subsidiary Guarantor is
the surviving corporation);

(2) sell, assign, convey, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all its assets as an
entirety or substantially as an entirety, in one transaction or a series of related transactions, to any
Person; or

(3) permit any Person to merge with or into it

unless:

(a) the other Person is the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Company or any Restricted
Subsidiary that is a Guarantor or becomes a Guarantor substantially concurrently with such
consolidation, merger, sale, assignment, conveyance, transfer, lease or other disposal;

(b) (1) either (x) a Guarantor is the continuing Person or (y) the resulting, surviving or
transferee Person expressly assumes all the obligations of the Guarantor under its Note
Guarantee and the Senior Secured Indenture (pursuant to a supplemental indenture
executed and delivered in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee) and all obligations
of the Guarantor under the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement and the Security Documents, as applicable; and (2) immediately after giving
effect to the transaction, no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing; or

(c) the transaction constitutes a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or
merger) of a Guarantor or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of a
Guarantor (in each case other than to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary) otherwise
permitted by the Senior Secured Indenture;

_provided, however, that the prohibition in clauses (1), (2) and (3) above shall not apply to the extent_
that compliance with clauses (a) and (b)(1) could give rise to or result in: (1) any breach or violation of
statutory limitations, corporate benefit, financial assistance, fraudulent preference, thin capitalization
rules, capital maintenance rules, guidance and coordination rules or the laws, rules or regulations (or
analogous restriction) of any applicable jurisdiction; (2) any risk or liability for the officers, directors
or (except in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership) shareholders of such Restricted
Subsidiary (or, in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership, directors or shareholders of
the partners of such partnership); or (3) any cost, expense, liability or obligation (including with respect
to any Taxes) other than reasonable out-of-pocket expenses.

**_General_**

The provisions set forth in this covenant shall not restrict (and shall not apply to): (i) any Restricted
Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor from consolidating with, merging or liquidating into or transferring
all or substantially all its properties and assets to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, a Guarantor or any
other Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor; (ii) any Guarantor from merging or liquidating into
or transferring all or part of its properties and assets to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or another
Guarantor; (iii) any consolidation or merger of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer into any Guarantor;
_provided that, if the Senior Secured Notes Issuer is not the surviving entity of such merger or_
consolidation, the relevant Guarantor will assume the obligations of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer
under the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Secured Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents, and clauses (1) and (4) under the
heading “—The Senior Secured Notes Issuer” shall apply to such transaction; or (iv) the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer or any Guarantor consolidating into or merging or combining with an Affiliate

257


-----

incorporated or organized for the purpose of changing the legal domicile of such entity, reincorporating
such entity in another jurisdiction, or changing the legal form of such entity; provided, however, that
clauses (1), (2) and (4) under the heading “—The Company,” clauses (1), (2) and (4) under the heading
“—The Senior Secured Notes Issuer” or clauses (a) and (b) under the heading “—The Guarantors,” as
the case may be, shall apply to any such transaction.

Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, this covenant will not apply to the Transactions or the Retail
Transaction.

**Financial Calculations**

If any amount is incurred or utilized under any Consolidated EBITDA or ratio-based basket, such
amount shall be permitted notwithstanding any subsequent change in Consolidated EBITDA, the
Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio, the Consolidated Secured Net Leverage Ratio, the
Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio, the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio or any other financial ratio or
metric. If (x) a proposed action, matter, transaction or amount (or a portion thereof) is incurred or
entered into pursuant to a fixed basket or the grower component of any other basket and (y) at a later
time would subsequently be permitted under a ratio-based basket, unless otherwise elected by the
Company, such action, matter, transaction or amount (or a portion thereof) shall automatically be
reclassified to such ratio-based basket.

In the event that any amount or transaction meets the criteria of more than one of the baskets or
exceptions set out in the Senior Secured Indenture, the Company, in its sole discretion, will classify and
may from time to time reclassify that amount or transaction to a particular basket or exception and will
only be required to include that amount or transaction in one of those baskets or exceptions (and, for
the avoidance of doubt, an amount or transaction may at the option of the Company be split between
different baskets or exceptions).

Any reference in the Senior Secured Indenture to an Applicable Metric shall be deemed to be a reference
to such Applicable Metric as determined at the Applicable Test Date.

In relation to any action, matter or transaction (including an Investment or permitted acquisition) which
would result in a cumulative increase to Consolidated EBITDA of the Group (in an amount as confirmed
by the Company by reference to the date of commitment thereto after giving pro forma effect thereof
and any adjustments permitted by the Senior Secured Indenture) (each a “Qualifying Transaction”),
from such date until the date on which the internal consolidated financial statements of the Company
or the SFA Reporting Entity falling immediately after completion of that Qualifying Transaction are
available, the Consolidated Pro Forma EBITDA of the Group for the purposes of all baskets, ratios and
thresholds in this Agreement which include a calculation by reference to Consolidated EBITDA shall
be increased (on a pro forma basis) by such amount confirmed by the Company. If the value of any of
the baskets, ratios or thresholds is subsequently decreased upon such internal consolidated financial
statements of the Company or the SFA Reporting Entity becoming available immediately following
completion of that Qualifying Transaction, any item undertaken or incurred in good faith prior to any
decrease shall be grandfathered and shall continue to be permitted notwithstanding the subsequent
reduction in the relevant baskets, ratios or thresholds.

For any relevant basket set by reference to a financial year, fiscal year, calendar year or fixed period
(each an “Annual Period”):

(i) at the option of the Company, the maximum amount so permitted under such basket during
such Annual Period may be increased by:

(A) an amount equal to 100% of the difference (if positive) between the permitted amount
in the immediately preceding Annual Period and the amount thereof actually used or

258


-----

applied by the Group during such preceding Annual Period (the “Carry Forward
**Amount”); and/or**

(B) an amount equal to 50% of the permitted amount in the immediately following Annual
Period and the permitted amount in such immediately following Annual Period shall
be reduced by such corresponding amount (the “Carry Back Amount”); and

(ii) to the extent that the maximum amount so permitted under such basket during such Annual
Period is increased in accordance with paragraph (i) above, any usage of such basket during
such Annual Period shall be deemed to be applied in the following order:

(A) firstly against any Carry Forward Amount;

(B) secondly against the maximum amount so permitted during such Annual Period prior
to any increase in accordance with paragraph (i) above; and

(C) thirdly against any Carry Back Amount.

To the extent that any Indebtedness, Lien, distribution, payment or Investment or other transaction
referred to in or contemplated by the definition of Applicable Test Date, satisfies any Applicable Metric,
or other test or condition on the Applicable Test Date, such Applicable Metric, test or condition shall
be deemed to have been satisfied, including on the date of its incurrence or on any other date of
determination under the Senior Secured Indenture and irrespective of any facts or circumstances
(including financial condition) on any such date or thereafter.

Where any Applicable Metric is calculated in connection with the incurrence of any Permitted
Indebtedness and/or the granting of any Permitted Lien, such Applicable Metric may be calculated on
a pro forma basis for:

(i) the use of the proceeds of such Permitted Indebtedness (including, for the avoidance of doubt,
any anticipated increase to Consolidated EBITDA attributable to any Purchase or other
transaction to be funded in whole or in part from such Permitted Indebtedness); and

(ii) the incurrence and use of the proceeds of any other Permitted Indebtedness in respect of which
the Applicable Test Date has occurred.

Subject to the sixth paragraph under the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness,” the
exchange rates used in the calculation of any Applicable Metric shall be, at the sole election of the
Company, from time to time:

(i) such rate taking into account any cross currency derivatives entered into by the Group in
respect of such amounts,

(ii) the weighted average exchange rates for the relevant period,

(iii) the spot rate of exchange on the relevant date (elected and determined by the Company acting
reasonably and in good faith),

(iv) the spot rate of exchange on the Issue Date (elected and determined by the Company acting
reasonably and in good faith), or

259


-----

(v) otherwise consistent with the exchange rate methodology applied in the Quarterly Financial
Statements or, as the case may be, the Annual Financial Statements for the applicable fourquarter reference period.

Any calculation or measure that is determined with reference to the Company’s financial statements
(including, without limitation, Consolidated EBITDA, Consolidated Interest Expense, Consolidated
Net Income, Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage, Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage
Ratio, Consolidated Secured Net Leverage, Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio, Fixed Charge Coverage
Ratio and Fixed Charges), in the sole discretion of the Company, may be determined with reference to
the financial statements of the SFA Reporting Entity (and including, for the avoidance of doubt and
without double-counting, amounts related to any Indebtedness of the Company and the Restricted
Subsidiaries which is not already included therein) or a Parent Entity of the Company instead, so long
as, in the case of a Parent Entity, such Parent Entity does not hold any material assets other than, directly
or indirectly, the Equity Interests of the Company (as determined by the Board of Directors or an Officer
of the Company or the Senior Secured Notes Issuer in good faith).

Each of the following is an “Event of Default” under the Senior Secured Indenture:

(1) default in any payment of interest on any Senior Secured Note issued under the Senior Secured
Indenture when due and payable, continued for 30 days;

(2) default in the payment of the principal amount of or premium, if any, on any Senior Secured Note
issued under the Senior Secured Indenture when due at its Stated Maturity, upon optional
redemption, upon required repurchase, upon declaration or otherwise;

(3) failure by the Parent (only with respect to the covenants under the headings “—Certain
_Covenants—Impairment of Security Interests” and “—Certain Covenants Additional Intercreditor_
_Agreements”), the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary to comply for 60 days after notice by_
the Trustee or the Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes with its
other agreements contained in the Senior Secured Indenture;

(4) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by which
there may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Company or any
of its Restricted Subsidiaries (or the payment of which is Guaranteed by the Company or any of
its Restricted Subsidiaries), other than Indebtedness owed to the Company or a Restricted
Subsidiary, which:

(a) is caused by a failure to pay principal at stated maturity on such Indebtedness, immediately
upon the expiration of the grace period provided in such Indebtedness (“payment default”);
or

(b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its maturity (the “cross-acceleration
provision”),

and in each case, the principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the principal
amount of any other such Indebtedness under which there has been a payment default or the
maturity of which has been so accelerated, aggregates the greater of U.S.$180 million and 25% of
Consolidated EBITDA or more and any such Default continues for more than 20 Business Days;

(5) other than on a solvent basis, certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or court protection of the
Company or a Significant Subsidiary or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as
of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Company), would constitute a
Significant Subsidiary (the “bankruptcy provisions”);

(6) failure by the Company or any Significant Subsidiary or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that,
taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Company), would

260


-----

constitute a Significant Subsidiary to pay final judgments aggregating in excess of the greater of
U.S.$180 million and 25% of Consolidated EBITDA (exclusive of any amounts for which a
solvent insurance company has acknowledged liability), which judgments are not paid, discharged
or stayed for a period of 60 days after the judgment becomes final (the “judgment default
**provision”);**

(7) any Security Interest under the Security Documents shall, at any time, cease to be in full force and
effect (other than in accordance with the terms of the relevant Security Document, the Intercreditor
Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Senior Secured Indenture) with
respect to Collateral having a fair market value in excess of the greater of U.S.$15 million and 2%
of Consolidated EBITDA for any reason other than the satisfaction in full of all obligations under
the Senior Secured Indenture or the release of any such Security Interest in accordance with the
terms of the Senior Secured Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement or the Security Documents or any such security interest created thereunder shall be
declared invalid or unenforceable or the Company, the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary shall
assert in writing that any such security interest is invalid or unenforceable, and any such Default
continues for 10 days (the “security default provision”);

(8) any Note Guarantee of a Significant Subsidiary ceases to be in full force and effect (other than in
accordance with the terms of such Note Guarantee, the Senior Secured Indenture, the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) or is declared invalid or unenforceable in
a judicial proceeding or any Guarantor denies or disaffirms in writing its obligations under its
Note Guarantee, and any such Default continues for 10 days (the “guarantee provision”); and

(9) the failure by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer to consummate the Special Mandatory Redemption
to the extent required, as described under “Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.”

If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in clause (5) above) occurs and is
continuing, the Trustee, by notice to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, or the Holders of at least 30% in
principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Senior Secured Indenture, by written notice to the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Trustee, may, and the Trustee at the request of such Holders shall,
declare the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest on all the Senior Secured
Notes under the Senior Secured Indenture to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such
principal, premium and accrued and unpaid interest will be due and payable immediately. In the event
of a declaration of acceleration of the Senior Secured Notes because an Event of Default described in
clause (4) under the definition of “—Events of Default” has occurred and is continuing, the declaration
of acceleration of the Senior Secured Notes shall be automatically annulled if the event of default or
payment default triggering such Event of Default pursuant to clause (4) shall be remedied or cured, or
waived by the holders of the Indebtedness, or the Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of Default
shall have been discharged in full, within 30 days after the declaration of acceleration with respect
thereto and if (1) the annulment of the acceleration of the Senior Secured Notes would not conflict with
any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction and (2) all existing Events of Default, except
nonpayment of principal, premium or interest on the Senior Secured Notes that became due solely
because of the acceleration of the Senior Secured Notes, have been cured or waived.

If an Event of Default described in clause (5) above occurs and is continuing, the principal of, premium,
if any, and accrued and unpaid interest on all the Senior Secured Notes will become and be immediately
due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders. Holders
of the Senior Secured Notes may not enforce the Senior Secured Indenture or the Senior Secured Notes
except as provided in the Senior Secured Indenture and may not enforce the Security Documents except
as provided in such Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement.

Any notice of Default or Event of Default under the first paragraph of this section (other than an Event
of Default described in clause (5) above), notice of acceleration with respect to an Event of Default
under the first paragraph of this section (other than an Event of Default described in clause (5) above)

261


-----

or instruction to the Trustee to provide a notice of Default or Event of Default under the first paragraph
of this section (other than an Event of Default described in clause (5) above), notice of acceleration with
respect to an Event of Default under the first paragraph of this section (other than an Event of Default
described in clause (5) above) or take any other action with respect to an alleged Default or Event of
Default the first paragraph of this section (other than an Event of Default described in clause (5) above)
(a “Noteholder Direction”) provided by any one or more Holders (each, a “Directing Holder”) must
be accompanied by a written representation from each such Holder to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer
and the Trustee that such Holder is not, or, in the case such Holder is the Relevant Clearing System or
the Relevant Clearing System’s nominee, that such Holder is being instructed solely by beneficial
owners that are not, Net Short (a “Position Representation”), which representation, in the case of a
Senior Secured Noteholder Direction relating to a notice of Default or Event of Default shall be deemed
repeated at all times until the resulting Event of Default is cured or otherwise ceases to exist or the
Senior Secured Notes are accelerated. In addition, each Directing Holder must, at the time of providing
a Senior Secured Noteholder Direction, covenant to provide the Senior Secured Notes Issuer with such
other information as the Senior Secured Notes Issuer may reasonably request from time to time in order
to verify the accuracy of such Directing Holder’s Position Representation within five Business Days of
request thereof (a “Verification Covenant”). In any case in which the Holder is the Relevant Clearing
System or the Relevant Clearing System’s nominee, any Position Representation or Verification
Covenant required hereunder shall be provided by the beneficial owner of the Senior Secured Notes in
lieu of the Relevant Clearing System or the Relevant Clearing System’s nominee.

If, following the delivery of a Senior Secured Noteholder Direction, but prior to acceleration of the
Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer determines in good faith that there is a
reasonable basis to believe a Directing Holder was, at any relevant time, in breach of its Position
Representation and the Senior Secured Notes Issuer provides to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate
(which shall be provided to the Holders) certifying that the Senior Secured Notes Issuer (i) believes in
good faith that there is a reasonable basis to believe a Directing Holder was at any relevant time in
breach of its Position Representation or its Verification Covenant and (ii) has filed papers with a court
of competent jurisdiction seeking a determination that such Directing Holder was, at such time, in
breach of its Position Representation, and seeking to invalidate any Event of Default that resulted from
the applicable Noteholder Direction, the cure period with respect to such Event of Default shall be
automatically stayed pending a final and non-appealable determination of a court of competent
jurisdiction on such matter. If such Officer’s Certificate has been delivered to the Trustee, the Trustee
shall refrain from acting in accordance with such Noteholder Direction until such time as the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer provides to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that (i) a Directing Holder
has satisfied its Verification Covenant, (ii) a Directing Holder has failed to satisfy its Verification
Covenant or (iii) a court of competent jurisdiction rules that such Directing Holder was, at such time,
not in breach of its Position Representation or its Verification Covenant, and during such time the cure
period with respect to any Event of Default that resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction shall
be automatically stayed pending satisfaction of such Verification Covenant. Any breach of the Position
Representation shall result in such Directing Holder’s participation in such Noteholder Direction being
disregarded; and, if, without the participation of such Directing Holder, the percentage of Senior
Secured Notes held by the remaining Holders that provided such Noteholder Direction would have been
insufficient to validly provide such Noteholder Direction, such Noteholder Direction shall be void ab
initio, with the effect that such Event of Default shall be deemed never to have occurred, and any related
acceleration rescinded, and the Trustee shall be deemed not to have received such Noteholder Direction
or any notice of such alleged Default or Event of Default, shall not be permitted to act thereon and shall
be restricted from accepting and acting on any future Noteholder Direction in relation to such Event of
Default, unless such direction is given by Holders holding the requisite level of consent of Holders
required under the Senior Secured Indenture to give such Noteholder Direction (excluding, for the
avoidance of doubt, any Directing Holder for so long as such Directing Holder is in breach of its Position
Representation). If the Directing Holder has satisfied its Verification Covenant, then the Trustee shall
be permitted to act in accordance with such Noteholder Direction. Notwithstanding the above, if such
Directing Holder’s participation is not required to achieve the requisite level of consent of Holders

262


-----

required under the Senior Secured Indenture to give such Noteholder Direction, the Trustee shall be
permitted to act in accordance with such Noteholder Direction notwithstanding any action taken or to
be taken by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer (as described above). The Trustee shall be entitled to
conclusively rely on any Senior Secured Noteholder Direction or Officer’s Certificate delivered to it in
accordance with the Senior Secured Indenture without verification, investigation or otherwise as to the
statements made therein.

Each Holder by accepting a Senior Secured Note acknowledges and agrees that the Trustee (and any
agent) shall not be liable to any party howsoever arising for acting or refraining to act in accordance
with (i) the foregoing provisions, (ii) any Senior Secured Noteholder Direction, (iii) any Officer’s
Certificate or (iv) its duties under the Senior Secured Indenture, as the Trustee may determine in its sole
discretion. The Trustee shall have no obligation (i) to monitor, investigate, verify or otherwise
determine if a Holder has Net Short position, (ii) investigate the merits, validity, accuracy or
authenticity of any Position Representation or Officer’s Certificate, as the case may be, (iii) inquire if
the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will seek action to determine if a Directing Holder has breached its
Position Representation, (iv) enforce any Verification Covenant, (v) monitor any court proceedings
undertaken in connection therewith, (vi) monitor or investigate whether any Default or Event of Default
has been publicly reported or (vii) otherwise make any calculations, investigations or determinations
with respect to any Derivative Instruments, Net Short position, Long Derivative Instrument, Short
Derivative Instrument or otherwise. The Trustee shall be entitled to rely on its rights, protections and
benefits under the Senior Secured Indenture at all times, including without limitation for actions that
are taken and subsequently stayed or annulled.

The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Senior Secured
Indenture by notice to the Trustee may, on behalf of all Holders, waive all past or existing Defaults or
Events of Default (except with respect to nonpayment of principal, premium, interest or Additional
Amounts, if any) and rescind any such acceleration with respect to such Senior Secured Notes and its
consequences if rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent
jurisdiction.

Subject to the provisions of the Senior Secured Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee, if an
Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the
rights or powers under the Senior Secured Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders
unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity or security satisfactory to the Trustee against
any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal or interest
when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the Senior Secured Indenture or the Senior
Secured Notes unless:

(1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee notice that an Event of Default is continuing and, if
such Event of Default is in respect of an Event of Default other than as described in clause (5) of
the first paragraph of this section, such Holder is not in breach of a Position Representation or
Verification Covenant;

(2) Holders, or in the case of any clauses (other than clause (5)) of the first paragraph of this section,
Directing Holders that are not in breach of a Position Representation or Verification Covenant, of
at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have requested the Trustee to pursue
the remedy;

(3) such Holder has offered the Trustee security or indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee against any
loss, liability or expense;

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the request and
the offer of such security or indemnity; and

(5) the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not given the Trustee
a direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request within such 60-day
period.

263


-----

Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes
are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy
available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Senior Secured
Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee
will be required in the exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use
in the conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts
with law or the Senior Secured Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the
rights of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any
action under the Senior Secured Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to indemnification or other
security satisfactory to it in its sole discretion against all losses, liabilities and expenses caused by taking
or not taking such action. The Trustee will have no obligation to monitor compliance by the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer with the Senior Secured Indenture. The Senior Secured Indenture will provide
that if a Default occurs and is continuing and the Trustee is informed in writing of such occurrence by
the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the Holders within 60
days after being so notified by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer. Except in the case of a Default in the
payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on any Senior Secured Note, the Trustee may
withhold notice if and so long as the Trustee determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the
Holders.

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of
each fiscal year, an Officer’s Certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default or
Event of Default that occurred and is continuing during the previous year. The Senior Secured Notes
Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice
of any events of which it is aware which would constitute a Default that has occurred and is continuing,
their status and what action the Senior Secured Notes Issuer is taking or proposes to take in respect
thereof.

The Senior Secured Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default occurs for a failure to deliver a required
certificate in connection with another default (an “Initial Default”), then at the time such Initial Default
is cured, such Default for a failure to report or deliver a required certificate in connection with the Initial
Default will also be cured without any further action and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the
failure to comply with the time periods prescribed in the covenant entitled “Certain Covenants—
_Reports” or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of the Senior_
Secured Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon the delivery of any such report required by such
covenant or notice or certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed
period specified in the Senior Secured Indenture.

The Senior Secured Indenture will provide for the Trustee to take action on behalf of the Holders in
certain circumstances, but only if the Trustee is indemnified or secured to its satisfaction. It may not be
possible for the Trustee to take certain actions in relation to the Senior Secured Notes and, accordingly,
in such circumstances the Trustee will be unable to take action, notwithstanding the provision of an
indemnity to it, and it will be for Holders to take action directly.

**Amendments and Waivers**

Subject to certain exceptions, the Senior Secured Notes Documents may be amended, supplemented or otherwise
modified with the consent of Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes then
outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for,
Notes) and, subject to certain exceptions, any default or compliance with any provisions thereof may be waived
with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes then
outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for,
Notes); provided that, if any amendment, supplement, other modification or waiver will only amend, supplement
or waive one series of the Senior Secured Notes, only the consent of a majority in aggregate principal amount of
the then outstanding Notes of such series shall be required. However, without the consent of Holders holding not
less than 90% of the then outstanding principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes affected, an amendment or

264


-----

waiver may not, with respect to any Senior Secured Notes held by a non-consenting Holder or, if any amendment,
waiver or other modification will only amend, supplement, modify or waive one series of the Senior Secured
Notes, without the consent of Holders holding not less than 90% of the then outstanding aggregate principal
amount of such series of Senior Secured Notes affected, with respect to any such series of Senior Secured Notes
held by a non-consenting Holder:

(1) reduce the principal amount of Senior Secured Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment, waiver
or modification;

(2) reduce the stated rate of or extend the stated time for payment of interest on any Senior Secured Note;

(3) reduce the principal of or extend the Stated Maturity of any Senior Secured Note;

(4) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any Senior Secured Note or change the time at which
any Senior Secured Note may be redeemed, in each case, as described under “—Optional Redemption”;

(5) make any Senior Secured Note payable in money other than that stated in the Senior Secured Note;

(6) impair the contractual right of any Holder of any outstanding Note to bring suit for the enforcement of any
such payment on or with respect to such Holder’s Notes on or after the due dates therefor;

(7) make any change in the provision of the Senior Secured Indenture described under “—Withholding Taxes”
that adversely affects the right of any Holder of such Senior Secured Notes in any material respect or amends
the terms of such Senior Secured Notes in a way that would result in a loss of an exemption from any of the
Taxes described thereunder or an exemption from any obligation to withhold or deduct Taxes so described
thereunder unless the Senior Secured Notes Issuer agrees to pay Additional Amounts, if any, in respect
thereof;

(8) release all or substantially all the security interests granted for the benefit of the Holders in the Collateral
other than in accordance with the terms of the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement, any
applicable Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Senior Secured Indenture;

(9) waive a Default or Event of Default with respect to the nonpayment of principal, premium or interest or
Additional Amounts, if any, on the Senior Secured Notes (except pursuant to a rescission of acceleration of
the Senior Secured Notes by the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of such Senior
Secured Notes and a waiver of the payment default that resulted from such acceleration);

(10) release all or substantially all the Guarantors from their obligations under the Note Guarantees or the Senior
Secured Indenture, except in accordance with the terms of the Senior Secured Indenture and the Intercreditor
Agreement; or

(11) make any change in the amendment or waiver provisions which require the Holders’ consent described in
this sentence.

For the avoidance of doubt, the Senior Secured Indenture shall not include any provision incorporating, giving
effect to, or otherwise reflecting the provisions of Section 316(b) of the Trust Indenture Act.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any Holder, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Trustee,
the Security Agent and the other parties thereto, as applicable, may amend or supplement any Senior Secured
Notes Documents:

(1) to cure any ambiguity, omission, defect, error or inconsistency;

(2) to provide for the assumption by a successor Person of the obligations of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer
or any Restricted Subsidiary under any Senior Secured Notes Document;

(3) to add to the covenants or provide for a Note Guarantee for the benefit of the Holders or surrender any right
or power conferred upon the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(4) to make any change that would provide additional rights or benefits to the Trustee or the Holders or that
does not adversely affect the rights or benefits to the Trustee or any of the Holders in any material respect
under the Senior Secured Notes Documents;

(5) to make such provisions as necessary (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or an Officer
of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer) for the issuance of Additional Senior Secured Notes;

265


-----

(6) to provide for any Restricted Subsidiary to provide a Note Guarantee in accordance with the covenant
described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” or “—Limitation on Additional
_Guarantees,” to add Note Guarantees with respect to the Senior Secured Notes, to add security to or for the_
benefit of the Senior Secured Notes, or to confirm and evidence the release, termination, discharge or
retaking of any Note Guarantee or Lien (including the Collateral and the Security Documents) or any
amendment in respect thereof with respect to or securing the Senior Secured Notes when such release,
termination, discharge or retaking or amendment is provided for under the Senior Secured Indenture, the
Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(7) to conform the text of the Senior Secured Indenture, the Security Documents or the Senior Secured Notes
to any provision of this “Description of the Senior Secured Notes” to the extent that such provision in this
“Description of the Senior Secured Notes” was intended to be a verbatim recitation of a provision of the
Senior Secured Indenture, the Security Documents or the Senior Secured Notes;

(8) to evidence and provide for the acceptance and appointment under the Senior Secured Indenture or the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement of a successor trustee or security agent
pursuant to the requirements thereof or to provide for the accession by the Trustee or Security Agent to any
Senior Secured Notes Document;

(9) in the case of the Security Documents, to mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or grant a security interest in favor
of the Security Agent for the benefit of the Holders, holders of the Senior Notes or parties to the Senior
Secured Credit Facilities Agreement, in any property which is required by the Security Documents or the
Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement (as in effect on the Issue Date or the Escrow Release Date) to
be mortgaged, pledged or hypothecated, or in which a security interest is required to be granted to the
Security Agent, or to the extent necessary to grant a Security Interest in the Collateral for the benefit of any
Person; provided that the granting of such security interest is not prohibited by the Senior Secured Indenture
or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the covenant described under
“—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest” is complied with;

(10) to comply with the rules of any applicable securities depositary;

(11) make any amendment to the provisions of the Senior Secured Indenture relating to the transfer and legending
of Senior Secured Notes as permitted by the Senior Secured Indenture, including to facilitate the issuance
and administration of Senior Secured Notes; provided that (i) compliance with the Senior Secured Indenture
as so amended would not result in Notes being transferred in violation of the Securities Act or any other
applicable securities law and (ii) such amendment does not adversely affect the rights of Holders to transfer
Notes in any material respect;

(12) to make any amendment of an administrative or ministerial nature to the provisions of the Senior Secured
Indenture, the Senior Secured Notes or the Security Documents to facilitate a Permitted Reorganization; or

(13) as provided in “—Certain Covenants—Additional Intercreditor Agreements.”

In formulating its decision on such matters, the Trustee shall be entitled to require and rely on such evidence as it
deems necessary, including Officer’s Certificates and Opinions of Counsel. The consent of the Holders is not
necessary under the Senior Secured Indenture to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment of any
Senior Secured Notes Document. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the proposed
amendment. A consent to any amendment or waiver under the Senior Secured Indenture by any Holder of Senior
Secured Notes given in connection with a tender of such Holder’s Notes will not be rendered invalid by such
tender.

All Senior Secured Notes issued under the Senior Secured Indenture will vote and consent together on all matters
(as to which any of such Senior Secured Notes may vote) as one class, and no series of Senior Secured Notes will
have the right to vote or consent as a separate series on any matter; provided, however, that if any amendment,
supplement, waiver or other modification will only affect the Dollar Senior Secured Notes or the Euro Senior
Secured Notes (or a separate series of future Additional Senior Secured Notes), only the consent of the applicable
majority in principal amount of the then-outstanding Dollar Senior Secured Notes or Euro Senior Secured Notes
(or such other series), as applicable (and not the consent of the Holders of at least such a majority of all Senior
Secured Notes), will be required.

For purposes of voting or consenting (or any other matter requiring a determination based on a percentage of
principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes outstanding), the aggregate principal amount of outstanding Euro

266


-----

Senior Secured Notes will be calculated using the Dollar Equivalent of such aggregate principal amount
outstanding as of the date of determination.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the paragraphs above, in order to effect an amendment authorized by
clauses (3) or (6) above to add a Guarantor under the Senior Secured Indenture, it shall only be necessary for the
supplemental indenture providing for the accession of such additional Guarantor to be duly authorized and
executed by (i) the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, (ii) such additional Guarantor and (iii) the Trustee. Any other
amendments permitted by the Senior Secured Indenture need only be duly authorized and executed by the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer and the Trustee.

**Acts by Holders**

In determining whether the Holders of the required principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes have concurred
in any direction, waiver or consent, the Senior Secured Notes owned by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or by
any Person directly or indirectly controlling, or controlled by, or under direct or indirect common control with,
the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will be disregarded and deemed not to be outstanding; _provided that, for the_
purpose of determining whether the Trustee shall be protected in relying on any such direction, waiver or consent,
only Notes which the Trustee knows are so owned shall be so disregarded.

**Defeasance**

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer at any time may terminate all obligations of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and
each Guarantor under the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Indenture (“legal defeasance”) and cure
all then existing Defaults and Events of Default, except for certain obligations, including those respecting the
defeasance trust, the rights, powers, trusts, duties, immunities and indemnities of the Trustee and the obligations
of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer in connection therewith and obligations concerning issuing temporary Notes,
registration of Senior Secured Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes and the maintenance of an office
or agency for payment and money for security payments held in trust. Subject to the foregoing, if the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, the Security Documents and the rights of the Trustee
and the Holders under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement in effect at such
time will terminate (other than with respect to the defeasance trust).

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer at any time may terminate its and the Restricted Subsidiaries’ obligations under
the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants” (other than clauses (1) and (2) under “—Merger and
_Consolidation—The Senior Secured Notes Issuer”) and “—Change of Control,” and the default_
provisions relating to such covenants described under “—Events of Default” above, the operation of the
cross-default upon a payment default, the cross-acceleration provision, the bankruptcy provisions, the
judgment default provision, the guarantee provision and the security default provision described under
“—Events of Default” (“covenant defeasance”).

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer at its option at any time may exercise its legal defeasance option
notwithstanding its prior exercise of its covenant defeasance option. If the Senior Secured Notes Issuer
exercises its legal defeasance option, payment of the Senior Secured Notes may not be accelerated
because of an Event of Default with respect to such Senior Secured Notes. If the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer exercises its covenant defeasance option with respect to the Senior Secured Notes, payment of
the Senior Secured Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default specified in clause (3)
(other than with respect to clauses (1) and (2) of the covenant described under “—Merger and
_Consolidation—The Senior Secured Notes Issuer”), (4), (5) (with respect only to the Significant_
Subsidiaries), (6), (7) or (8) under “—Events of Default.”

In order to exercise either defeasance option, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer must irrevocably deposit
in trust (the “defeasance trust”) with the Trustee (or another entity designated or appointed (as agent)
by the Trustee for this purpose), (i) with respect to the Dollar Senior Secured Notes, money in U.S.
dollars or U.S. dollar-denominated U.S. Government Obligations or a combination thereof and (ii) with
respect to the Euro Senior Secured Notes, money in euros, European Government Obligations or a
combination thereof, in each case in such amounts as will be sufficient for the payment of principal,
premium, if any, and interest on the Senior Secured Notes to redemption or maturity, as the case may

267


-----

be; provided that, if requested by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Trustee or the relevant Paying
Agent (on its behalf) will distribute any amounts deposited with it to the Holders prior to the Stated
Maturity or redemption date, as the case may be, and must comply with certain other conditions,
including delivery to the Trustee of:

(1) an Opinion of Counsel in the United States to the effect that Holders of the relevant Notes will not
recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such deposit and
defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amount and in the same
manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such deposit and defeasance had not
occurred (and in the case of legal defeasance only, such Opinion of Counsel in the United States
must be based on a ruling received by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer from, or published by, the
U.S. Internal Revenue Service or change in applicable U.S. federal income tax law);

(2) an Officer’s Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer
with the intent of defeating, hindering, delaying, defrauding or preferring any creditors of the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer;

(3) an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent
provided for or relating to legal defeasance or covenant defeasance, as the case may be, have been

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Senior Secured Indenture, and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the Intercreditor
Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents will be discharged
and cease to be of further effect (except as to surviving rights of conversion or transfer or exchange of
the Senior Secured Notes, as expressly provided for in the Senior Secured Indenture, or as to any other
provision of the Senior Secured Indenture, which, pursuant to its terms, expressly survives such
discharge) as to all outstanding Notes when (1) either (a) all the Senior Secured Notes previously
authenticated and delivered (other than certain lost, stolen or destroyed Notes, and certain Notes for
which provision for payment was previously made and thereafter the funds have been released to the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer) have been delivered to the relevant Paying Agent for cancellation; or
(b) all Senior Secured Notes not previously delivered to the relevant Paying Agent for cancellation
(i) have become due and payable, (ii) will become due and payable at their Stated Maturity within one

to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the relevant Paying Agent in the name, and at
the expense, of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer; (2) the Senior Secured Notes Issuer has deposited or
caused to be deposited with the Trustee (or another entity designated or appointed (as agent) by the

Euro Senior Secured Notes, money in euros, European Government Obligations or a combination

on the Senior Secured Notes not previously delivered to the relevant Paying Agent for cancellation, for
principal, premium, if any, and interest to the date of deposit (in the case of Senior Secured Notes that
have become due and payable), or to the Stated Maturity or redemption date, as the case may be; (3) the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer has paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable under the Senior

as the case may be, and (5) the Senior Secured Notes Issuer has delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s

268


-----

Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (provided that such counsel may not be an employee of the
Company or its Subsidiaries) each to the effect that the conditions precedent to the satisfaction and
discharge of the Senior Secured Indenture described in this section have been complied with; provided
that any such counsel may rely on any Officer’s Certificate as to matters of fact (including as to
compliance with the foregoing clauses (1), (2) and (3)).

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Shareholders**

No director, officer, employee, incorporator or shareholder of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or Affiliates, as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or
any Guarantor under the Senior Secured Notes Documents or for any claim based on, in respect of, or
by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each Holder by accepting a Senior Secured Note waives
and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the
Senior Secured Notes. Such waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the U.S. federal
securities laws and it is the view of the SEC that such a waiver is against public policy.

**Concerning the Trustee and Certain Agents**

Ankura Trust Company, LLC will be appointed as Trustee under the Senior Secured Indenture. The
Senior Secured Indenture will provide that, except during the continuance of an Event of Default, the
Trustee will perform only such duties as are set forth specifically in the Senior Secured Indenture.
During the existence of an Event of Default, the Trustee will exercise such of the rights and powers
vested in it under the Senior Secured Indenture and use the same degree of care that a prudent Person
would use in conducting its own affairs. The permissive rights of the Trustee to take or refrain from
taking any action enumerated in the Senior Secured Indenture will not be construed as an obligation or
duty.

The Senior Secured Indenture will impose certain limitations on the rights of the Trustee, should it
become a creditor of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, to obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or
to realize on certain property received in respect of any such claim as security or otherwise. The Trustee
or any Agent will be permitted to engage in other transactions with the Company and its Affiliates and
Subsidiaries.

The Senior Secured Indenture will set out the terms under which the Trustee may retire or be removed
and replaced. Such terms will include, among others, (1) that the Trustee may be removed at any time
by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of then outstanding Notes, or may resign at any time
by giving written notice to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, and that if the Trustee at any time (a) has
or acquires actual knowledge of a conflict of interest while a Default is continuing that is not eliminated,
or (b) becomes incapable of acting as Trustee or becomes insolvent or bankrupt, then the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer may remove the Trustee, or any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder for not less than
six months may petition any court for removal of the Trustee and appointment of a successor Trustee.
Any removal or resignation of the Trustee shall not become effective until the acceptance of
appointment by the successor Trustee.

The Senior Secured Indenture will contain provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee for any
loss, liability, Taxes or expenses Incurred without gross negligence, willful misconduct or fraud on its
part, arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of the Senior Secured
Indenture and any other Senior Secured Notes Document.

The Trustee will also act in certain roles, including as trustee in respect of the Senior Notes and security
agent in respect of obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement and the Senior
Notes. See also “Related Party Transactions—Ankura Trust Company.”

-----

**Notices**

Notices, warnings, summonses and other communications to the holders of the Senior Secured Notes
from the Trustee shall be sent via the Relevant Clearing System (as applicable) with a copy to the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer. Any such notice or communication shall be deemed to be given or made when
sent from the Relevant Clearing System (as applicable). The Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s written
notifications to the holders of Senior Secured Notes shall be sent through the Relevant Clearing System
(as applicable) with a copy to the Trustee. In addition, for so long as any of the Senior Secured Notes
are listed on the Official List of the Exchange and if and for so long as the rules of Authority shall so
require, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will notify the Authority of any notice with respect to the
Senior Secured Notes.

**Prescription**

Claims against the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Guarantors for the payment of principal, or
premium, if any, on the Senior Secured Notes will be prescribed 10 years after the applicable due date
for payment thereof. Claims against the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Guarantors for the payment
of interest on the Senior Secured Notes will be prescribed six years after the applicable due date for
payment of interest.

**Currency Indemnity and Calculation of Pound Sterling-Denominated Restrictions**

The sole currency of account and payment for all sums payable by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer is
U.S. dollars in respect of the Dollar Senior Secured Notes and euros in respect of the Euro Senior
Secured Notes. Any amount received or recovered in a currency other than U.S. dollars or euros,
respectively (whether as a result of, or the enforcement of, a judgment or order of a court of any
jurisdiction, in the winding-up or dissolution of the Company, any Subsidiary or otherwise), by a Holder
in respect of any sum expressed to be due to it from the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will constitute a
discharge of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer only to the extent of the U.S. dollar amount, in the case of
the Dollar Senior Secured Notes, or euros, in respect of the Euro Senior Secured Notes, as the case may
be, which the recipient is able to purchase with the amount so received or recovered in that other
currency on the date of that receipt or recovery (or, if it is not possible to make that purchase on that
date, on the first date on which it is possible to do so). If that U.S. dollar or euro amount is less than the
U.S. dollar or euro amount, respectively, expressed to be due to the recipient under the Senior Secured
Indenture or a relevant Senior Secured Note, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will indemnify the
recipient against any loss sustained by it as a result. In any event, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will
indemnify the recipient against the cost of making any such purchase.

Except as otherwise specifically set forth herein, for purposes of determining compliance with any U.S.
dollar-denominated restriction herein, the Dollar Equivalent for purposes hereof that is denominated in
a currency other than U.S. dollars shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in
effect on the date such non-U.S. dollar amount is Incurred or made, as the case may be.

**Enforceability of Judgments**

Since substantially all the assets of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Guarantors are located
outside the United States, any judgment obtained in the United States against the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer or the Guarantors, including judgments with respect to the payment of principal, premium,
interest, Additional Amounts, if any, and any redemption price and any purchase price with respect to
the Senior Secured Notes, may not be collectable within the United States. See “Risk Factors—Risks
_Related to the Notes, the Note Guarantees and the Collateral—Corporate benefit, financial assistance_
_laws, capital maintenance and other limitations on the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral may_
_adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral” and_
“Certain Insolvency Law Considerations”.

**Consent to Jurisdiction and Service**

In relation to any legal action or proceedings arising out of or in connection with the Senior Secured
Indenture and the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Guarantors will in the
Senior Secured Indenture irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of the federal and state courts in the
Borough of Manhattan in the City of New York, County and State of New York, United States.

**Governing Law**

Senior Secured Escrow Charges and the rights and duties of the parties thereunder, shall be governed

ownership of Restricted Subsidiaries, during the four-quarter reference period or subsequent to
such reference period and on or prior to the Calculation Date, or that are to be made on the
Calculation Date, will be given pro forma effect (as determined in good faith by a responsible
accounting or financial officer of the Company), including in respect of Relevant Adjustments as
described (without duplication) in clause (14) of the definition of “Consolidated EBITDA”;
_provided that, if definitive documentation has been entered into with respect to a Purchase that is_
part of the transaction causing a calculation to be made hereunder, Consolidated EBITDA for such
period will be calculated after giving pro forma effect to such Purchase (including in respect of

as determined in accordance with IFRS, and operations, businesses or group of assets constituting
a business or operating unit (and ownership interests therein) disposed of prior to the Calculation

from any such disposal, as determined by a responsible accounting or financial officer of the
Company);

(3) the Consolidated Interest Expense attributable to discontinued operations, as determined in
accordance with IFRS, and operations, businesses or group of assets constituting a business or
operating unit (and ownership interests therein) disposed of prior to the Calculation Date, will be
excluded on a pro forma basis as if such disposition occurred on the first day of such period, but
only to the extent that the obligations giving rise to such Consolidated Interest Expense will not
be obligations of the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries following the Calculation
Date;

(4) any Person that is a Restricted Subsidiary on the Calculation Date will be deemed to have been a
Restricted Subsidiary at all times during such reference period;

(5) any Person that is not a Restricted Subsidiary on the Calculation Date will be deemed not to have
been a Restricted Subsidiary at any time during such reference period;

(6) if any Indebtedness bears a floating rate of interest, the interest expense on such Indebtedness will
be calculated as if the rate in effect on the Calculation Date had been the applicable rate for the
entire period (taking into account any Interest Rate Agreement applicable to such Indebtedness),
and if any Indebtedness is not denominated in the Company’s functional currency, that
Indebtedness for purposes of the calculation of Consolidated Net Leverage shall be treated in
accordance with IFRS; and

(7) the full run-rate effect of Relevant Adjustments as described (without duplication) in clause (14)
of the definition of “Consolidated EBITDA”; provided that such Relevant Adjustments are not
duplicative of any cost savings, expense reductions and cost synergies already included for such

**DESCRIPTION OF THE SENIOR NOTES**

You will find definitions of certain capitalized terms used in this “Description of the Senior Notes”
under the heading “—Certain Definitions.” For purposes of this “Description of the Senior Notes,”
references to (i) the “Senior Notes Issuer” are to Ardonagh Group Finance Limited, and its successors,
only and not to any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) the “Company” are to Ardonagh Midco 2 plc, and its
successors, only and not to any of its Subsidiaries and (iii) “Topco” are to Ardonagh Midco 1 Ltd., and
its successors, only and not to any of its Subsidiaries. References to “we” or “us” or the “Group” are
to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

The Senior Notes Issuer will issue U.S.$1,000 million in aggregate principal amount of    % Senior
Notes due 2032 (the “Senior Notes”). Unless the context otherwise requires, for all purposes of the
Senior Indenture and this “Description of the Senior Notes”, references to “Senior Notes” shall be
deemed to include the Senior Notes initially issued on the Issue Date and any Additional Senior Notes
(as defined herein). The Senior Notes will be issued under an indenture to be dated as of      , 2024
(the “Senior Indenture”), between, the Senior Notes Issuer, Ankura Trust Company, LLC, as trustee
(the “Trustee”), as initial paying agent, as transfer agent (the “Transfer Agent”), as registrar (the
“Registrar”), and as security agent (the “Security Agent”), in a private transaction that is not subject
to the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act. The Senior Indenture will not be qualified
under the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended.

The following description is a summary of the material provisions of the Senior Indenture and the Senior
Notes and refers to the Senior Escrow Agreement, the Security Documents and the Intercreditor
Agreement. It does not restate those agreements in their entirety. We urge you to read the Senior
Indenture, the Senior Notes, the Senior Escrow Agreement, the Security Documents and the
Intercreditor Agreement because they, and not this description, define your rights as Holders of the
Senior Notes. Copies of the Senior Indenture, the form of the Senior Notes, the Senior Escrow
Agreement, the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement are available as set forth in this
Offering Memorandum under the caption “Where You Can Find More Information.”

We intend to use the proceeds of the offering of the Senior Notes, together with proceeds from drawings
under the Term Facilities, proceeds from the Senior Secured Notes (as defined below) sold on the Issue
Date and certain proceeds from the Retail Transaction, (i) to fund the Existing Notes Redemption; (ii)
to repay drawn amounts under the Existing Senior Secured Credit Facilities; (iii) to pay the fees and
expenses incurred in connection with the Transactions, including fees and expenses incurred in
connection with the offering of the Senior Notes and redemption costs incurred in connection with the
Existing Notes Redemption; and (iv) for general corporate purposes, including one or more acquisition
opportunities in the near term. See “Use of Proceeds” and “Capitalization”.

Substantially concurrently with the closing of the offering, the gross proceeds of the Senior Notes sold
on the Issue Date will be deposited into the Senior Escrow Account (as defined below). In the event
that (i) the Escrow Longstop Date (as defined below) occurs and the Escrow Agent (as defined below)
shall not have received the Escrow Release Officer’s Certificate (as defined below) on or prior to such
date or (ii) the Senior Notes Issuer informs the Escrow Agent in writing that, in the good faith judgment
of the Senior Notes Issuer, the Escrow Release Condition (as defined below) will not be completed on
or prior to the Escrow Longstop Date, the Senior Notes Issuer will redeem the entire outstanding
aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes at a price equal to 100% of the issue price of the
respective Senior Notes as stated on the cover page of this offering memorandum, plus accrued and
unpaid interest on the Senior Notes, and Additional Amounts, if any, from, and including, the Issue
Date, to, but excluding, the Special Mandatory Redemption Date (as defined below). See “Escrow of
_Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.”_

The Senior Indenture will be subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement (as defined below). The terms of the Intercreditor Agreement are important to

315


-----

understanding relative ranking of indebtedness and security, the ability to make payments in respect of
the indebtedness, procedures for undertaking enforcement action, subordination of certain indebtedness
(including the Note Guarantees), turnover obligations, release of security and guarantees, and the
payment waterfall for amounts received by the Security Agent.

The registered Holder of a Senior Note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. Only registered
Holders will have rights under the Senior Indenture, including, without limitation, with respect to
enforcement and the pursuit of other remedies. The Senior Notes have not been, and will not be,
registered under the U.S. Securities Act and are subject to certain transfer restrictions.

As of the Issue Date, all the Company’s Subsidiaries will be “Restricted Subsidiaries” for purposes of
the Senior Indenture. However, under the circumstances described below under “—Certain
_Definitions—Unrestricted Subsidiary”, we will be permitted to designate certain of our Subsidiaries as_
“Unrestricted Subsidiaries.” Our Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive
covenants in the Senior Indenture and will not guarantee the Senior Notes.

**The Senior Notes**

The Senior Notes will:

- be general senior obligations of the Senior Notes Issuer;

- be secured as set forth under “—Security”;

- rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future Indebtedness of the Senior
Notes Issuer that is not expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Senior Notes;

- rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future Indebtedness of the Senior Notes
Issuer that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Senior Notes;

- be guaranteed on a senior basis by the Company and on a senior subordinated basis by the
Subsidiary Guarantors as described under “—The Note Guarantees”;

- mature on    , 2032; and

- be represented by one or more registered notes in global registered form, but in certain
circumstances may be represented by Definitive Registered Notes (see “Book-Entry, Delivery
_and Form”)._

**The Note Guarantees**

**_General_**

Subject to and in accordance with the Agreed Security Principles, the Senior Notes will be guaranteed
(i) on a senior basis on the Escrow Release Date by the Company; and (ii) on a senior subordinated
basis on the Escrow Release Date by Midco 3, Ardonagh Finco plc, Ardonagh Services Limited, the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer and each other borrower (if any) under and as defined in the Senior Secured
Credit Facilities Agreement (the “Subsidiary Guarantors” and together with the Company, the
“Guarantors”).

In addition, subject to the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement and the Agreed Security Principles,
certain other Restricted Subsidiaries may provide a Note Guarantee in the future if required by the
covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Additional Guarantees”. The Note
Guarantees will be joint and several obligations of the Guarantors.

The Note Guarantee of the Company will:

- be a general senior obligation of the Company;

316


-----

- be secured as set forth under “—Security”;

- rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future Indebtedness of the Company
that is not expressly subordinated in right of payment to its Note Guarantee;

- rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future Indebtedness of the Company that is
expressly subordinated in right of payment to its Note Guarantee;

- be effectively subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness or obligation of the Company
that is secured by property and assets that do not secure such Note Guarantee or that is secured
on a first-priority basis over property or assets that secure the Senior Notes on a second-priority
basis, to the extent of the value of the property and assets securing such Indebtedness, including
the obligations under the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Credit Facilities
Agreement; and

- be structurally subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness of the Subsidiaries of the
Company that are not Guarantors, including obligations to trade creditors.

The Note Guarantee of each Subsidiary Guarantor will:

- be a general senior subordinated obligation of such Subsidiary Guarantor;

- be secured as set forth under “—Security”;

- rank _pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future Indebtedness of such_
Subsidiary Guarantor that is not expressly subordinated in right of payment to its Note
Guarantee;

- be subordinated in right of payment to all such Subsidiary Guarantor’s existing and future
senior indebtedness, including any obligations under the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior
Secured Credit Facilities Agreement and certain hedging obligations;

- rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future Indebtedness of such Subsidiary
Guarantor that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to its Note Guarantee;

- be effectively subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness or obligation of such
Subsidiary Guarantor that is secured by property and assets that do not secure such Note
Guarantee or that is secured on a first-priority basis over property or assets that secure the
Senior Notes on a second-priority basis, to the extent of the value of the property and assets
securing such Indebtedness, including the obligations under the Senior Secured Notes and the
Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement; and

- be structurally subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness of the Subsidiaries of such
Subsidiary Guarantor that are not Guarantors, including obligations to trade creditors.

The obligations of a Guarantor under its Note Guarantee will be limited as necessary to prevent the
relevant Note Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance, preference, transfer at under value
or unlawful financial assistance under applicable law, or otherwise to reflect corporate benefit rules,
“thin capitalization” rules, retention of title claims, laws on the preservation of share capital, limitations
of corporate law, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally or other limitations
under applicable law which, among other things, might limit the amount that can be guaranteed by
reference to the net assets and legal capital of the relevant Guarantor. Additionally, the Note Guarantees
will be subject compliance with to certain corporate law procedures. The Note Guarantees will be
further limited as required under the Agreed Security Principles which apply to and restrict the
requirement to grant guarantees and security in favor of obligations under the Senior Secured Credit
Facilities Agreement and the Senior Notes where, among other things, any such grant would be
restricted by general statutory or other legal limitations or requirements and may be precluded if the

317


-----

cost of such grant is disproportionate to the benefit to the creditors, including the Holders, of obtaining
the applicable guarantee. By virtue of these limitations, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Note
Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Senior Notes, or a
Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Note Guarantee.

All the operations of the Company will be conducted through its subsidiaries (collectively, the
“Group”) and, therefore, the Company and the Senior Notes Issuer will depend on the cash flow of the
Group to meet their obligations, including the Company’s obligations under the Proceeds Loan and the
Senior Notes Issuer’s obligations under the Senior Notes. Under applicable local regulations, cash and
cash equivalents held by the Group can only be upstreamed to their direct or indirect parent entities,
including to the Company for purposes of servicing its obligations under the Proceeds Loan, to the
extent that sufficient profits available for distribution exist within these legal entities and that they
continue to meet relevant minimum regulatory capital requirements, as applicable.

Given the regulated nature of our business, we have limited ability to grant upstream credit support. As
a result, the Senior Notes Issuer and the Guarantors will represent approximately 4.3% of our Adjusted
EBITDA (without giving effect to the Retail Transaction) for the twelve months ended September 30,
2023. As of September 30, 2023, after giving _pro forma_ effect to the Transactions and the Retail
Transaction as if they had occurred on that date, the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries would
have had £3,749 million (equivalent) of indebtedness, of which an estimated £2,842 million (equivalent)
represented senior secured indebtedness and £108 million represented lease liabilities and other
indebtedness of entities other than the Company, the Senior Notes Issuer or the Guarantors. In addition,
there would have been £191.5 million (equivalent) available for drawing under the Super Senior
Revolving Facility (prior to giving effect to any increase in respect of commitments thereunder, which
we expect may result in between £240-300 million of commitments available for drawing) and, after
giving effect to the Transactions, an expected U.S.$175 million, €165 million and AUD100 million
expected to be available for drawing under CAR Facilities.

Claims of creditors of non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries, including trade creditors and creditors
holding debt and guarantees issued by those Restricted Subsidiaries, and claims of preferred
stockholders (if any) of those Restricted Subsidiaries and minority stockholders of non-Guarantor
Restricted Subsidiaries (if any) generally will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of
those Restricted Subsidiaries over the claims of creditors of the Senior Notes Issuer and the Guarantors,
including Holders of the Senior Notes. The Senior Notes and each Note Guarantee therefore will be
structurally subordinated to creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred stockholders (if any) of
Restricted Subsidiaries of the Senior Notes Issuer (other than the Guarantors) and minority stockholders
of non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries (if any). Although the Senior Indenture will limit the
Incurrence of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock of Restricted Subsidiaries, the
limitation is subject to a number of significant exceptions. Moreover, the Senior Indenture will not
impose any limitation on the Incurrence by Restricted Subsidiaries of liabilities that are not considered
Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock under the Senior Indenture. See “—Certain
_Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness.”_

**_Subordination of the Note Guarantees_**

Each of the Note Guarantees (other than the Note Guarantee of the Company) is a senior subordinated
Note Guarantee, which means that, pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, each such
Note Guarantee will rank behind, and will be expressly subordinated to, all the existing and future
Senior Indebtedness of the relevant Subsidiary Guarantor, including any obligations owed by the
relevant Subsidiary Guarantor under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement, certain hedging
obligations and any other indebtedness ranking pari passu therewith incurred after the Issue Date. The
ability to take enforcement action against the Subsidiary Guarantors under their Note Guarantees is

318


-----

subject to significant restrictions imposed by the Intercreditor Agreement and the terms of the Note
Guarantees, and potentially any Additional Intercreditor Agreement entered into after the Issue Date.

In addition, the Note Guarantees and the Collateral are subject to release under certain circumstances,
including, but not limited to, certain enforcement actions taken by the Security Agent acting at the
direction of an instructing group of senior secured creditors. Because of the foregoing subordination
provisions, it is likely that holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Subsidiary Guarantors would recover
disproportionately more than the holders of the Senior Notes in any insolvency or similar proceeding
relating to such entity. In any such case, there may be insufficient assets, or no assets, remaining to pay
the principal of or interest on the Senior Notes after the repayment in full of all Senior Indebtedness.
The Note Guarantees of the Subsidiary Guarantors will also be subject to the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement, including payment blockage upon a senior default and standstill on enforcement. For a
description of the restrictions imposed by the Intercreditor Agreement, see “Description of Other
_Indebtedness and Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement”._

**_Note Guarantees Release_**

The Note Guarantee of a Guarantor will automatically and unconditionally terminate and release:

- upon a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of the Capital
Stock of the relevant Subsidiary Guarantor (whether by direct sale or sale of a Holding
Company), if the sale or other disposition is not prohibited by the Senior Indenture and the
Subsidiary Guarantor ceases to be a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of the sale or other
disposition;

- so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, to the extent that such Subsidiary
Guarantor that provides a Guarantee under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement (i) is
unconditionally released and discharged from its liability with respect to the Senior Secured
Credit Facilities Agreement and (ii) is not providing a Guarantee in respect of any other Credit
Facility that replaces the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement or any Public Debt at such
time that will not also be released substantially simultaneously with the release of the Senior
Notes Guarantee and/or a Guarantee under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement;

- upon the sale or disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of all or substantially
all the assets of the Subsidiary Guarantor (other than to the Company or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries), if the sale or other disposition is not prohibited by the Senior Indenture;

- upon the designation in accordance with the Senior Indenture of the Subsidiary Guarantor as
an Unrestricted Subsidiary;

- with respect to any Subsidiary Guarantor, in connection with a solvent liquidation of such
Subsidiary Guarantor pursuant to which substantially all the assets of such Subsidiary
Guarantor remain owned by the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary;

- upon legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Senior Notes,
as provided in “—Defeasance” and “—Satisfaction _and Discharge”;_

- upon the release of the Subsidiary Guarantor’s Note Guarantee under any Indebtedness that
triggered such Subsidiary Guarantor’s obligation to Guarantee the Senior Notes under the
covenant described in “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Additional Guarantees”;

- in accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement;

- as described under “—Amendments and Waivers”;

- in connection with the implementation of a Permitted Reorganization;

319


-----

- with respect to an entity that is not the successor Company or a successor Subsidiary Guarantor
(as applicable), as a result of a transaction permitted by “—Merger and Consolidation—The
_Company” or “—Merger and Consolidation—The Guarantors” (as applicable); or_

- in connection with any regulatory redress liability management exercise pursuant to clause
(24) of the definition of Asset Disposition or clause (21) of the definition of Permitted
Investments.

The Trustee and the Security Agent shall execute any documents or take all necessary actions
reasonably requested in writing by the Senior Notes Issuer, including the granting of releases or waivers
under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, to effectuate any release
of a Note Guarantee in accordance with these provisions, subject to customary protections and
indemnifications. Each of the releases set forth above shall be effected by the Trustee and the Security
Agent without the consent of or liability to the Holders or any other action or consent on the part of the
Trustee or the Security Agent.

**Principal, Maturity and Interest**

On the Issue Date, the Senior Notes Issuer will issue U.S.$1,000 million in aggregate principal amount
of Senior Notes. The Senior Notes Issuer may issue an unlimited principal amount of Additional Senior
Notes under the Senior Indenture from time to time, subject to all the covenants in the Senior Indenture,
including the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness”. The
Senior Notes and any Additional Senior Notes subsequently issued under the Senior Indenture will be
treated as a single class for all purposes under the Senior Indenture, including, without limitation,
waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase, except as otherwise provided in the Senior
Indenture. See “—Additional Senior Notes”. The Senior Notes will be issued in minimum
denominations of U.S.$200,000 and integral multiples of U.S.$1,000 in excess thereof. The Senior
Notes will mature on    , 2032.

Interest on the Senior Notes will accrue at the rate of      % per annum. Interest on the Senior Notes
will:

- accrue from the Issue Date or, if interest has already been paid, from the date it was most recently
paid;

- be payable semi-annually in arrears on     and     , commencing on     , 2024;

- be payable, for so long as the Senior Notes are Global Notes (as defined below) to the Holder of
record of the Senior Notes at the close of business (in DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream (in each
case, as applicable, the “Relevant Clearing System”)) to the Holders of record of the Senior
Notes on       and       immediately preceding the related interest payment date; and

- be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months.

Interest on overdue principal, premium or Additional Amounts will accrue at a rate that is 1% higher
than the rate of cash interest otherwise applicable to the Senior Notes. In no event will the rate of interest
on the Senior Notes be higher than the maximum rate permitted by law.

The rights of holders of beneficial interests in the Senior Notes to receive the payments of interest on
such Notes are subject to applicable procedures of the Relevant Clearing System. If the due date for any
payment in respect of any Senior Notes is not a Business Day at the place at which such payment is due
to be paid, the Holder thereof will not be entitled to payment of the amount due until the next succeeding
Business Day at such place, and will not be entitled to any further interest or other payment as a result
of any such delay.

We cannot assure you that the Company’s Subsidiaries will have the ability to dividend or otherwise
distribute funds to the Company in order to allow the Company to pay interest on the Proceeds Loan in

320


-----

order to allow the Senior Notes Issuer to make cash interest payments on the Senior Notes. The ability
of the Company’s Subsidiaries to make dividends or distributions to the Company is subject to
important exceptions. See “—The Senior Notes” and “Description of Other Indebtedness and Financing
_Arrangements.”_

**_Methods of Receiving Payments on the Senior Notes_**

Principal, interest and premium and Additional Amounts, if any, on the Global Notes (as defined below)
will be made by one or more Paying Agents by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
account specified by the registered Holder thereof (being the common depositary or its nominee for the
Relevant Clearing System).

Principal, interest and premium, and Additional Amounts, if any, on any certificated securities
(“Definitive Registered Notes”) will be payable at the specified office or agency of one or more Paying
Agents maintained for such purposes. In addition, interest on the Definitive Registered Notes may be
paid, at the option of the Senior Notes Issuer, by check mailed to the address of the Holder entitled
thereto as shown on the register of Holders of Senior Notes for the Definitive Registered Notes. See
“—Paying Agent, Transfer Agent and Registrar for the Senior Notes” below.

**_Paying Agent, Transfer Agent and Registrar for the Senior Notes_**

The Senior Notes Issuer will maintain one or more Paying Agents for the Senior Notes. The initial
Paying Agent will be Ankura Trust Company, LLC (the “Paying Agent”).

The Senior Notes Issuer will also maintain a registrar (the “Registrar”) and a transfer agent (the
“Transfer Agent”). The initial Registrar will be Ankura Trust Company, LLC and the initial Transfer
Agent will be Ankura Trust Company, LLC. The Registrar will maintain a register reflecting ownership
of the Senior Notes outstanding from time to time, if any, and together with the Transfer Agent, will
facilitate transfers of the Senior Notes on behalf of the Senior Notes Issuer.

The Senior Notes Issuer may change any Paying Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent for the Senior
Notes without prior notice to the Holders of the Senior Notes. The Senior Notes Issuer or any of its
Subsidiaries may act as Paying Agent or Registrar in respect of the Senior Notes.

**The Proceeds Loan**

On or about the Escrow Release Date, the Senior Notes Issuer will loan the proceeds of the offering of
Senior Notes issued on the Issue Date to the Company pursuant to one or more proceeds loans (the
“Proceeds Loan”) lent under one or more proceeds loan agreements (the “Proceeds Loan
**Agreement”) to be dated as at the Escrow Release Date.**

The Proceeds Loan will be denominated in U.S. dollars in a total aggregate principal amount equal to
the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes issued on the Issue Date. The Proceeds Loan
Agreement will provide that the Company will pay the Senior Notes Issuer interest and principal in an
amount sufficient to pay amounts due under the Senior Notes, as well as any Additional Amounts due
thereunder on a timely basis in order to ensure that the Senior Notes Issuer can satisfy its payment
obligations under the Senior Notes and the Senior Indenture. The Proceeds Loan Agreement will have
the same maturity as the Senior Notes.

The Proceeds Loan will be assigned by way of security to the Security Agent for the benefit of the
Holders.

**Additional Senior Notes**

321


-----

The Senior Indenture will be unlimited in aggregate principal amount. From time to time, subject to the
Senior Notes Issuer’s compliance with the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants—
_Limitation on Indebtedness” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens,” the Senior Notes Issuer_
is permitted to issue additional Notes under the Senior Indenture (“Additional Senior Notes”) of the
same or different series, which shall have terms substantially identical to the Senior Notes except in
respect of any of the following terms which shall be set forth in an Officer’s Certificate or, at the election
of the Senior Notes Issuer, a supplemental indenture, supplied to the Trustee:

(10) whether such Additional Senior Notes shall be issued as part of a new or existing series of Senior
Notes or the title of such Additional Senior Notes (which shall distinguish the Additional Senior
Notes of the series from Senior Notes of any other series);

(11) the aggregate principal amount of such Additional Senior Notes;

(12) the issue price and the date or dates on which such Additional Senior Notes will be issued;

(13) the rate or rates (which may be fixed or floating) at which such Additional Senior Notes shall bear
interest and, if applicable, the interest rate basis, formula or other method of determining such
interest rate or rates, the date or dates from which such interest shall accrue, the interest payment
dates on which such interest shall be payable or the method by which such dates will be
determined, the record dates for the determination of holders thereof to whom such interest is
payable and the basis upon which such interest will be calculated;

(14) the currency or currencies in which such Additional Senior Notes shall be denominated and the
currency in which cash or government obligations in connection with such series of Additional
Senior Notes may be payable;

(15) the date or dates and price or prices at which, the period or periods within which, and the terms
and conditions upon which, such Additional Senior Notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part;

(16) if other than in denominations of U.S.$200,000 and in integral multiples of U.S.$1,000 in excess
thereof, the denominations in which such Additional Senior Notes shall be issued and redeemed;

(17) the CUSIP, ISIN, Common Code or other securities identification numbers with respect to such
Additional Senior Notes; and

(18) any relevant limitation language with respect to Note Guarantees and Security Documents.

All series of Additional Senior Notes will be treated, along with all other Senior Notes, as a single class
for the purposes of the Senior Indenture with respect to waivers, amendments and all other matters
which are not specifically distinguished for any applicable series; provided that if the Additional Notes
are not fungible for U.S. federal income tax purposes with the Initial Senior Notes, such Additional
Notes will be issued with a separate ISIN, Common Code, CUSIP or other securities identification
number, as applicable, from the Initial Senior Notes. Additional Senior Notes may be designated to be
of the same series as the Initial Senior Notes and shall be deemed to form one series therewith.

**Transfer and Exchange**

The Senior Notes will be issued in the form of several registered notes in global form without interest
coupons, as follows:

- Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under
the Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form
without interest coupons attached (the “144A Global Notes”). The 144A Global Notes will, on
the Issue Date, be deposited with a custodian for DTC and registered in the name of Cede & Co.,
as nominee of DTC; and

- Notes sold to non-U.S. persons outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the
Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without

322


-----

interest coupons attached (the “Regulation S Global Notes” and, together with the 144A Global
Notes, the “Global Notes”). The Regulation S Global Notes will, on the Issue Date, be credited
within DTC for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.

Ownership of interests in the Global Notes (“Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons that
have accounts with the Relevant Clearing System or persons that may hold interests through such
participants.

Ownership of Book-Entry Interests and transfers thereof will be subject to the restrictions on transfer
and certification requirements summarized below and described more fully under “Notice to Investors”.
In addition, transfers of Book-Entry Interests between participants in the Relevant Clearing System will
be effected by the Relevant Clearing System pursuant to customary procedures and subject to the
applicable rules and procedures established by the Relevant Clearing System and its or their respective
participants.

Book-Entry Interests in the 144A Global Notes (the “144A Book-Entry Interests”) may be transferred
to a person who takes delivery in the form of Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Notes
(the “Regulation S Book-Entry Interests”) denominated in the same currency only upon delivery by
the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the Senior Indenture) to the effect that
such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S under the Securities Act.

Subject to the foregoing, Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes
delivery in the form of 144A Book-Entry Interests in the same currency only upon delivery by the
transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the Senior Indenture) to the effect that such
transfer is being made to a person who the transferor reasonably believes is a “qualified institutional
buyer” within the meaning of Rule 144A in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A or
otherwise in accordance with the transfer restrictions described under “Notice to Investors” and in
accordance with any applicable securities law of any other jurisdiction.

Any Book-Entry Interest that is transferred as described in the immediately preceding paragraphs will,
upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note from which it was transferred and
will become a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note to which it was transferred. Accordingly, from
and after such transfer, it will become subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures
applicable to Book-Entry Interests in the Global Note to which it was transferred.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued, they will be issued only in minimum denominations of
U.S.$200,000 principal amount and integral multiples of U.S.$1,000 in excess thereof, upon receipt by
the Registrar of instructions relating thereto and any certificates, opinions and other documentation
required by the Senior Indenture. It is expected that such instructions will be based upon directions
received by the Relevant Clearing System, as applicable, from the participant which owns the relevant
Book-Entry Interests. Definitive Registered Notes issued in exchange for a Book-Entry Interest will,
except as set forth in the Senior Indenture or as otherwise determined by the Senior Notes Issuer in
compliance with applicable law, be subject to, and will have a legend with respect to, the restrictions
on transfer summarized below and described more fully under “Notice to Investors”.

Subject to the restrictions on transfer referred to above, Notes issued as Definitive Registered Notes
may be transferred or exchanged, in whole or in part, in minimum denominations of U.S.$200,000 in
principal amount and integral multiples of U.S.$1,000 in excess thereof. In connection with any such
transfer or exchange, the Senior Indenture will require the transferring or exchanging Holder to, among
other things, furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents, to furnish information regarding
the account of the transferee at the Relevant Clearing System, where appropriate, to furnish certain
certificates and opinions, and to pay any Taxes in connection with such transfer or exchange. Any such

323


-----

transfer or exchange will be made without charge to the Holder, other than any Taxes payable in
connection with such transfer.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Registrar and the Transfer Agent are not required to register the
transfer or exchange of any Senior Notes:

(5) for a period of 15 days prior to any date fixed for the redemption of the applicable Notes;

(6) for a period of 15 days immediately prior to the date fixed for selection of the applicable Notes
to be redeemed in part;

(7) for a period of 15 days prior to the record date with respect to any interest payment date; or

(8) which the Holder has tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a Change
of Control Offer, an Asset Disposition Offer or any other tender offer in respect of the Senior
Notes.

The Senior Notes Issuer, the Trustee, any Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent and the Registrar will be
entitled to treat the registered Holder of a Senior Note as the owner thereof for all purposes.

**Security**

**_General_**

On the Issue Date, the Senior Notes and the Note Guarantees will be secured on a first-ranking basis by
the Senior Escrow Charge. Upon receipt by the Trustee of an Escrow Release Officer’s Certificate or a
notice of Special Mandatory Redemption, the Escrowed Property will be released and the first-ranking
security interests over the Escrowed Property will automatically be released and terminate.

No later than the Escrow Release Date, the Senior Notes and the Note Guarantees will be secured on a
first-ranking basis:

- by third-party, limited recourse security over (i) the shares of the Company held by Topco; and
(ii) structural intercompany receivables owed to Topco by the Company (if any); (iii) the shares
of the Senior Notes Issuer held by the Company; and (iv) the Proceeds Loan and any other
structural intercompany receivables owed to the Senior Notes Issuer by the Company (the
“Topco Collateral”); and

- on a second-ranking basis, by security over (i) the shares of Midco 3 held by the Company; and
(ii) structural intercompany receivables owed to the Company by the Midco 3 (if any) (the
“Shared Collateral” and together with the Senior Escrow Charge, the Topco Collateral and
any and all assets from time to time in which a security interest has been or will be granted
pursuant to any Security Document to secure the obligations under the Senior Indenture, the
Senior Notes and/or any Note Guarantee, the “Collateral”).

As described above, the Collateral may also secure any Additional Senior Notes and certain other future
Indebtedness. In addition, the Shared Collateral will also secure obligations under the Senior Secured
Credit Facilities Agreement, the Senior Secured Notes and certain hedging obligations, and may secure
certain future Indebtedness on a first-ranking basis. The proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral
may not be sufficient to satisfy the obligations owed to the Holders of the Senior Notes. No appraisals
of the Collateral have been made in connection with this issuance of Senior Notes. By its nature, some
or all the Collateral will be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Accordingly,
the Collateral may not be able to be sold in a short period of time, or at all. See “Risk Factors—Risks
_Related to the Senior Notes, the Note Guarantees and the Collateral—The Senior Notes will be secured_
_only to the extent of the value of the Collateral that has been granted as security for the Senior Notes_

324


-----

_and future secured debt may be secured by certain assets that do not secure the Senior Notes. The value_
_of the Collateral securing the Senior Notes may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations under the_
_Senior Notes and such Collateral may be reduced or diluted under certain circumstances.”_

Notwithstanding the provisions of the covenant described below under “—Certain Covenants—
_Limitation on Liens,” certain property, rights and assets may not be pledged, and any pledge over_
property, rights and assets may be limited (or the Liens not perfected), in accordance with the Agreed
Security Principles, the Intercreditor Agreement and certain perfection requirements.

The following is a non-exhaustive summary of certain terms of the Agreed Security Principles, which
include, among others:

The Collateral shall not be required to include assets other than:

  - (i) the Shared Collateral, (ii) security over the shares owned by any Guarantor in the capital of
any other Guarantor; (iii) security over the material bank accounts of each Guarantor which are
located in its jurisdiction of organization (without control over use); (iv) security over any
intercompany receivables owed to any Guarantor by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary;
(v) security by way of a springing security interest over substantially all assets of each
Guarantor organized under the laws of Australia which are located in Australia pursuant to an
Australian law general security deed; (vi) by security over substantially all assets of each
Guarantor organized under the laws of England or Ireland pursuant to an English law or Irish
law (as applicable) debenture; (vii) security over substantially all the assets of each Guarantor
organized under the laws of the United States (or any state or political sub-division thereon)
which are located in the United States or any state thereof (including the District of Columbia)
and where such security is capable of being registered and perfected solely by customary UCC1 filings in the grantor's jurisdiction of incorporation or formation; and (viii) security over the
shares in the capital of certain material subsidiaries of the Company where such security is
required to be granted by the terms of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement;

- general legal and statutory limitations, regulatory restrictions, financial assistance, anti-trust
and other competition authority restrictions, corporate benefit, fraudulent preference, equitable
subordination, “transfer pricing,” “thin capitalization” (and in particular, guarantees and
security shall not result in all or part of the Senior Notes being considered related debt for thin
capitalization purposes), “earnings stripping,” “controlled foreign corporation” and other tax
restrictions, “exchange control restrictions,” “capital maintenance” rules and “liquidity
impairment” rules, retention of title claims, employee consultation or approval requirements
and similar principles may limit the ability of a member of the Group to provide a guarantee or
security or may require that the guarantee or security be limited as to amount or otherwise and,
if so, the guarantee or security will be limited accordingly; provided that, to the extent
reasonably requested by the Security Agent, the relevant member of the Group shall use
reasonable endeavors (exercised for a specified period of time but without incurring material
cost and without adverse impact on relationships with third parties) to overcome any such
obstacle or otherwise such guarantee or security document shall be subject to such limit;

- the exclusion of any guarantee or security interest to the extent that the grant thereof would (i)
be prohibited by or require consent from any central bank, supervisory authority, government,
statutory body or other regional, national or international regulatory body (each a “Regulator”),
(ii) require the Company or any of its Affiliates to directly or indirectly hold additional
regulatory, segregated and/or restricted capital (howsoever described); (iii) require the
Company or any of its Affiliates to directly or indirectly deposit or deliver (or procure the
deposit or delivery of) any additional collateral with, or grant any additional credit support to,
for the benefit of or as directed by, any Regulator; (iv) require the Company or any of its
Affiliates to directly or indirectly increase the nominal or actual amount of any insurance

325


-----

coverage provided it to in connection with the requirements of any Regulator or (v) otherwise
be reasonably likely to have an adverse effect on any license, consent or authorization granted
or to be granted by any Regulator (including any renewal thereof);

- the determination that the time and cost (including adverse effects on taxes, interest
deductibility, stamp duty, registration taxes, notarial costs, guarantee fees payable to any person
that is not a member of the Group and all applicable legal fees) will not be disproportionate to
the benefit accruing to the relevant secured parties of obtaining such guarantee or security;

- the exclusion from any guarantee or security of any asset subject to a legal requirement,
contract, lease, license, instrument, regulatory constraint (including any agreement with any
government or regulatory body) or other third party arrangement, which may prevent or
condition the asset from being charged, secured or being subject to the applicable security
document (including requiring a consent of any third party, supervisory board or works council
(or equivalent)) and any asset which, if subject to the applicable security document, would give
a third party the right to terminate or otherwise amend any rights, benefits and/or obligations
with respect to any member of the Group in respect of the asset or require the relevant charger
to take any action materially adverse to the interests of the Group or any member thereof;
provided that reasonable endeavors (exercised for a specified period of time but without
incurring material cost and without adverse impact on relationships with third parties) to obtain
consent to charging any asset (where otherwise prohibited) shall be used by the Group if the
Security Agent (acting reasonably) specifies upon reasonable notice that the asset is material
and the Senior Notes Issuer is satisfied that such endeavors will not involve placing
relationships with third parties in jeopardy;

- the agreement that members of the Group will not be required to give guarantees or enter into
security documents if they are not wholly owned by another member of the Group or if it is not
within the legal capacity of the relevant members of the Group or if it would conflict with the
fiduciary or statutory duties of their directors or contravene any applicable legal, regulatory or
contractual prohibition or restriction or have the potential to result in a material risk of personal
or criminal liability for any director or officer of or for any member of the Group; provided
that, to the extent reasonably requested by the Security Agent on reasonable notice, the relevant
member of the Group, in relation to a contractual prohibition or restriction only, shall use
reasonable endeavors (exercised for a specified period of time but without incurring material
cost and without adverse impact on relationships with third parties) to overcome any such
obstacle or otherwise such guarantee or security document shall be subject to such limit;

- the requirement that, to the extent legally effective, all security shall be given in favor of the
Security Agent and not the Holders individually (with the Security Agent to hold one set of
security documents for all the Holders); provided that it shall be permissible to use “parallel
debt” provisions where necessary (which shall be included in the Intercreditor Agreement and
not the individual security documents); and furthermore, the agreement that no member of the
Group shall be required to take any action in relation to any guarantees or security as a result
of any assignment or transfer of the Senior Notes by a Holder;

- the limitation of guarantees and security so that the aggregate of notarial costs and all
registration and like taxes and duties relating to the provision of security will not exceed an
amount to be agreed between the Senior Notes Issuer and the Security Agent, and the agreement
that where a class of assets to be secured includes material and immaterial assets, if the cost of
granting security over the immaterial assets is disproportionate to the benefit of such security,
security will be granted over the material assets only;

326


-----

- the agreement that security will not be required over any assets subject to security in favor of a
third party or any cash constituting regulatory capital or customer cash (and such assets or cash
shall be excluded from any relevant security document);

- the agreement it may be either impossible or impractical to create security over certain
categories of assets in which event security will not be taken over such assets;

- the agreement that no security may be provided on terms which are inconsistent with the
turnover or sharing provisions in the Intercreditor Agreement;

- the agreement that the giving of a guarantee, the granting of security and the registration and/or
the perfection of the security granted will not be required if it would have a material adverse
effect on the ability of the relevant member of the Group to conduct its operations and business
in the ordinary course as otherwise permitted by the Senior Notes Documents (including dealing
with the secured assets and all contractual counterparties or amending, waiving or terminating
(or allowing to lapse) any rights, benefits or obligations, in each case prior to an Event of
Default which is continuing), and the agreement that any requirement under the Agreed
Security Principles to seek consent of any person or take or not take any other action shall be
subject to the Agreed Security Principles;

- the agreement that other than a general security agreement and related filing, no perfection,
filing or other action will be required with respect to assets of a type not owned by members of
the Group;

- the agreement that no guarantees or security by any members of the Group which are organized,
established or incorporated in Dubai, Malaysia or South Africa;

- the agreement (i) that security in respect of the Senior Notes and the Senior Notes Guarantees
will only be granted over the Collateral or as otherwise expressly provided in the Senior
Indenture, (ii) that security will not be required from or over the assets of, any joint venture or
similar arrangement, any minority interest or any member of the Group that is not wholly owned
by another member of the Group, and (iii) no security will be required to be granted over certain
categories of assets, including, among other things, real estate, intellectual property, letter of
credit rights and insurance policies; and

- the agreement that no member of the Group will be required to grant security over any cash,
cash equivalent investments or other assets constituting regulatory, segregated and/or restricted
capital (howsoever described).][1]

similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other considerations
under applicable law, see “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations”.

**_Priority_**

The relative priority with regard to the security interests in the Collateral that are created by the Security
Documents (the “Security Interests” and each, a “Security Interest”) as between (a) the lenders under
the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement and the lenders of certain future indebtedness that is
_pari passu_ with the obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement, (b) the

327


-----

counterparties under certain hedging obligations, (c) the holders of the Senior Secured Notes (d) the
Holders of the Senior Notes, (e) the Trustee and the Security Agent and (f) the creditors of certain other
Indebtedness permitted to be secured by the Collateral, respectively, is established by the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents, which will provide, among other things, that the
obligations under the Senior Notes and the Senior Indenture will receive proceeds on enforcement of
security over the Shared Collateral only after the claims of the Senior Secured Notes, Senior Secured
Credit Facilities Agreement, certain hedging obligations and creditors under any future indebtedness
that may be secured on a first-ranking basis in accordance with the terms of the Senior Indenture and
the Intercreditor Agreement. In addition, pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement or Additional
Intercreditor Agreements entered into after the Issue Date, the Collateral may be pledged to secure other
Indebtedness and obligations as described herein. Under certain circumstances, the creditors under such
Indebtedness will receive proceeds from an enforcement of the Collateral in priority to the Trustee, the
Agents and the holders of the Senior Notes under the Senior Indenture. See “Description of Other
_Indebtedness and Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement”, “—Release of Liens,” “—_
_Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest” and “—Certain Definitions—Permitted_
_Collateral Liens.”_

**_Security Documents_**

Under the Security Documents, Topco, the Company and the Senior Notes Issuer have granted, or will
grant, security over the Collateral to secure the payment when due of the Senior Notes Issuer’s and the
Guarantors’ payment obligations under the Senior Notes, the Note Guarantees and the Senior Indenture.
The Security Documents have been, or will be, entered into by the relevant security provider and (other
than the Senior Escrow Charge) the Security Agent as agent for the secured parties. When entering into
the Security Documents, the Security Agent has acted in its own name, but for the benefit of the secured
parties (including itself, the Trustee and the holders of Senior Notes from time to time).

The Senior Escrow Charge shall be granted solely for the benefit of the Trustee on behalf of the Holders
of the Senior Notes, and no other persons (including, for the avoidance of doubt any lender under the
Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement, any holder of Senior Secured Notes, counterparties under
any Hedging Obligations or any other creditors) shall be entitled to benefit from the Senior Escrow
Charge.

The Senior Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement provide that, to the extent permitted by applicable
law, only the Security Agent will have the right to enforce the Security Documents on behalf of the
Trustee and the holders of the Senior Notes. As a consequence of such contractual provisions, holders
of the Senior Notes will not be entitled to take enforcement action in respect of the Collateral securing
the Senior Notes, except through the Trustee under the Senior Indenture, who will (subject to the
provisions of the Senior Indenture) provide instructions to the Security Agent in respect of the
enforcement of the Collateral. See “Description of Other Indebtedness and Financing Arrangements—
_Intercreditor Agreement.”_

The Senior Indenture will provide that, subject to the terms thereof and of the Security Documents and
the Intercreditor Agreement, the Senior Notes and the Note Guarantees, as applicable, will be secured
by Security Interests in the Collateral until all obligations under the Senior Notes, the Note Guarantees
and the Senior Indenture have been discharged. However, the Security Interests with respect to the
Senior Notes and the Senior Indenture may be released under certain circumstances as provided under
“—Release of Liens.”

In the event that the Senior Notes Issuer or its Subsidiaries enter into insolvency, bankruptcy or similar
proceedings, the Security Interests created under the Security Documents or the rights and obligations
enumerated in the Intercreditor Agreement could be subject to potential challenges. If any challenge to
the validity of the Security Interests or the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement were successful, the
Holders may not be able to recover any amounts under the Security Documents.

328


-----

Subject to the terms of the Senior Indenture, the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement and
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, Topco, the Senior Notes Issuer and the Guarantors will have
the right to remain in possession and retain exclusive control of the Collateral securing the Senior Notes,
to freely operate the property and assets constituting Collateral and to collect, invest and dispose of any
income therefrom (including any and all dividends, distributions or similar cash and non-cash payments
in respect of Capital Stock of the Guarantors that is part of the Collateral).

**_Enforcement of Security Interest_**

The Senior Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement restrict the ability of the Security Agent (acting
on its behalf or on behalf of the Holders) to enforce the Security Interests and provide for the release of
the Security Interests created by the Security Documents. The rights of the Security Agent to take
enforcement action under the Security Documents are subject to certain standstill provisions and other
limitations on enforcement pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement. The ability to enforce
may also be restricted by similar arrangements in relation to future Indebtedness that is secured on the
Collateral in compliance with the Senior Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement. See “Description
_of Other Indebtedness and Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”_

The Trustee has authorized the Security Agent to (i) perform the duties and exercise the rights, powers
and discretions that are specifically given to it under the Intercreditor Agreement and the security
documents securing such Indebtedness, together with any other incidental rights, power and discretions;
and (ii) execute each Security Document, waiver, modification, amendment, renewal or replacement
expressed to be executed by the relevant Security Agent on its behalf.

**_Intercreditor Agreement; Additional Intercreditor Agreements; Agreement to be Bound_**

The Senior Indenture will provide that it will be subject to the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement
and that the Senior Notes Issuer and the Trustee will be authorized (without any further consent of the
Holders of the Senior Notes) to enter into the Intercreditor Agreement and to give effect to its
provisions.

The Senior Indenture will provide that each Holder of the Senior Notes, by accepting such Note, will
be deemed to have:

- irrevocably appointed the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into and act as its agent under
the Intercreditor Agreement and the other relevant documents to which it is a party (including,
without limitation, in respect of the Security Agent, the Security Documents);

- irrevocably authorized the Security Agent to (i) perform the duties and exercise the rights,
powers and discretions that are specifically given to it under the Intercreditor Agreement or
other documents to which it is a party (including, without limitation, the Security Documents),
together with any other incidental rights, power and discretions; and (ii) execute each
document, waiver, modification, amendment, renewal or replacement expressed to be executed
by the Security Agent on its behalf; and

- accepted the terms and conditions of, and agreed to be bound by, the Intercreditor Agreement
and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and any Security Document and each Holder will
also be deemed to have authorized the Trustee to enter into and act as its agent under any such
Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The Intercreditor Agreement overrides any provisions in the Senior Indenture and to the extent that any
step or action is permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement, it will be deemed permitted under the
Senior Indenture.

329


-----

Similar provisions to those described above may be included in any Additional Intercreditor Agreement
(as defined below) entered into in compliance with the provisions described under “—Certain
_Covenants— Additional Intercreditor Agreements”._

**_Release of Liens_**

Topco and its Subsidiaries will be entitled to release the Security Interests in respect of the Collateral
under any one or more of the following circumstances:

(12) in connection with any sale or other disposition of Collateral to a Person that is not the Company
or a Restricted Subsidiary (but excluding any transaction subject to “—Merger and
_Consolidation”), if such sale or other disposition does not violate the covenant described under_
“—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock” or is otherwise
permitted in accordance with the Senior Indenture;

(13) in the case of a Guarantor that is released from its Note Guarantee pursuant to the terms of the
Senior Indenture, the release of the property and assets, and Capital Stock, of such Guarantor;

(14) as described under “—Amendments and Waivers”;

(15) upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations on the Senior Notes or legal
defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Senior Notes, as provided
in “—Defeasance” and “—Satisfaction and Discharge”;

(16) if the Company designates any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary in
accordance with the applicable provisions of the Senior Indenture, the release of the property and
assets, and Capital Stock, of such Unrestricted Subsidiary;

(17) in connection with the implementation of a Permitted Reorganization;

(18) in connection with the granting of Liens on such property or assets, which may include Collateral,
or the sale or transfer of such property or assets, which may include Collateral, in each case
pursuant to a Qualified Receivables Financing;

(19) in connection with any disposal of Collateral to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary; provided
that such release is followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent ranking
over the same assets in a manner consistent with, and pursuant to applicable formalities under,
the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest”;

(20) with respect to the Security Interests in respect of the Capital Stock of the Company to be offered,
within a reasonable time to facilitate an Initial Public Offering in which the Company is the IPO
Entity; provided that such Security Interests so released shall be promptly granted or re-granted,
as applicable, in favor of the Senior Notes in the event that such Capital Stock is not sold or the
Initial Public Offering does not complete for any reason;

(21) in connection with the Retail Transaction, the security over Nevada Investments TopCo Limited’s
shares in the capital of Atlanta Investment Holdings 3 Limited, Paymentshield Group Holdings
Limited’s shares in the capital of Paymentshield Limited and Swinton (Holdings) Limited’s
shares in the capital of Atlanta Insurance Intermediaries Limited (formerly known as Swinton
Group Limited); or

(22) as otherwise permitted in accordance with the Senior Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

In addition, the Security Interests created by the Security Documents will be released (a) in accordance
with an enforcement action pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement and (b) as may be permitted by the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—
_Impairment of Security Interest”._

330


-----

The Security Interests over the assets subject to the Senior Secured Escrow Charges will be released
upon the occurrence of the Escrow Release or in connection with the Special Mandatory Redemption.

The Security Agent (and if necessary the Trustee) shall execute any documents or will take all necessary
action reasonably requested in writing by the Senior Notes Issuer to effectuate any release of Collateral
securing the Senior Notes and the Note Guarantees, in accordance with the provisions of the Senior
Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the relevant
Security Document subject to customary protections and indemnifications. Each of the releases set forth
above shall occur automatically without the consent of the Holders, and without any action on the part
of the Security Agent or the Trustee (unless action is required by it to give effect to such release).

**Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption**

The Offering will be consummated prior to the funding under the New Senior Secured Credit
Facilities. Substantially concurrently with the closing of the Offering, the Senior Notes Issuer will enter
into an escrow agreement (as amended, supplemented or modified from time to time, the “Senior
**Escrow Agreement”) among the Senior Notes Issuer, the Trustee, Ankura Trust Company, LLC, as**
escrow agent (in such capacity, together with its successors, the “Escrow Agent”), pursuant to which
the Senior Notes Issuer will deposit, or cause to be deposited on its behalf, an amount in cash equal to
the gross proceeds of the Senior Notes sold on the Issue Date into one escrow account (the “Senior
**Escrow Account”). The Senior Escrow Account established will be segregated from the Senior Notes**
Issuer’s other funds. The Escrow Accounts will be controlled by the Senior Escrow Agent subject to
the terms of the Senior Escrow Agreement, on behalf of the Trustee and the Holders of the applicable
series of Senior Notes. The initial funds deposited in each of the Escrow Accounts, and all other funds,
securities, interest, dividends, distributions and other property and payments credited to the Senior
Escrow Account in connection with the Senior Notes (less any property and/or funds paid in accordance
with the Senior Escrow Account Agreement, such as ordinary course charges and fees paid to the bank
holding the Senior Escrow Account) are referred to, collectively, as the “Escrowed Property.” From and
including the Issue Date, including while the proceeds of the Senior Notes are deposited in the Senior
Escrow Account, interest in respect of the Senior Notes will be calculated in accordance with the terms
of the Senior Indenture and Senior Notes.

To secure the payment of the Special Mandatory Redemption Price (as defined below) of the Senior
Notes, the Senior Notes Issuer will grant the Trustee, for its benefit and for the benefit of the Holders
of the applicable series of Senior Notes, subject to certain liens of the Escrow Agent, a first-priority
security interest in the Senior Escrow Account, and the Senior Notes Issuer’s rights under the Senior
Escrow Agreement, pursuant to one or more escrow account charges dated the Issue Date between the
Senior Notes Issuer, the Trustee and the Escrow Agent (the “Senior Escrow Charge”); _provided,_
_however, that such liens and security interest shall automatically be released and terminated upon receipt_
by the Trustee of either an Escrow Release Officer’s Certificate (as defined below) or a notice of Special
Mandatory Redemption (as defined below). The Senior Escrow Charge will provide that the funds will
be segregated and held for the purposes specified herein. By its acceptance of the Senior Notes, each
Holder shall be deemed to authorize and direct the Trustee to execute, deliver and perform its
obligations under the Senior Escrow Agreement. The Escrow Agent will invest the Escrowed Property
as directed by the Senior Notes Issuer in such short-term liquid investments (including bank deposit
products) as permitted under the Escrow Agreement, and liquidate such investments as the Senior Notes
Issuer will from time to time direct in writing.

The Senior Escrow Agreement shall provide for the Escrow Agent to release from each Senior Escrow
Account, upon the instruction of the Senior Notes Issuer, a portion of the Escrowed Property in an
amount equal to the amount of accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, from, and
including, the Issue Date or the most recent interest payment date, as applicable, to, but excluding, any
interest payment date prior to the Escrow Release in order to satisfy the interest payment obligations in
respect of the Senior Notes under the Indenture as set forth under “Principal, Maturity and Interest.” In
addition, the Escrow Agent will be entitled pursuant to the Senior Escrow Agreement to deduct amounts

331


-----

from the Escrowed Property in respect of negative interest having accrued on the Escrowed Property
(if any).

Other than in connection with the payment of interest and Additional Amounts, if any, as set forth in
the previous paragraph, the Senior Notes Issuer will be entitled to cause the Escrow Agent to release
Escrowed Property (in which case the Escrowed Property will be paid to, or as directed by, the Senior
Notes Issuer) (the “Escrow Release”) (the date of the Escrow Release being referred to as the “Escrow
**Release Date”) upon delivery to the Escrow Agent, on or prior to March 31, 2024 (the “Escrow**
**Longstop Date”) of an Officer’s Certificate (the “Escrow Release Officer’s Certificate”), upon which**
the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely absolutely without further investigation, certifying that the
funding under the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities as described in _Summary—Recent_
_Developments—The Refinancing in this offering memorandum has occurred (the “Escrow Condition”)_
substantially concurrently with or promptly following the Escrow Release on the Escrow Release Date.

Upon the Escrow Release, the Escrowed Property will be paid out of the Senior Escrow Account in
accordance with the Senior Escrow Agreement for the purposes described under “Use of Proceeds” and
the Senior Escrow Account will be reduced to zero.

In the event that (i) the Escrow Longstop Date occurs and the Escrow Agent shall not have received the
Escrow Release Officer’s Certificate on or prior to such date or (ii) the Senior Notes Issuer informs the
Escrow Agent and the Trustee in writing that, in the good faith judgment of the Senior Notes Issuer, the
Escrow Condition will not be satisfied on or prior to the Escrow Longstop Date (the date of any such
event being the “Special Termination Date”), the Senior Notes Issuer will redeem the entire
outstanding aggregate principal amount of each series of the Senior Notes (the “Special Mandatory
**Redemption”) at a price (the “Special Mandatory Redemption Price”) equal to 100% of the issue**
price of such series of Senior Notes as stated on the cover page of this offering memorandum, plus
accrued and unpaid interest on the Senior Notes and Additional Amounts, if any, from, and including,
the Issue Date, to, but excluding, the Special Mandatory Redemption Date (as defined below), subject
to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest
payment date.

Notice of the Special Mandatory Redemption will be delivered by the Senior Notes Issuer no later than
one Business Day following the Special Termination Date, to the Trustee, the Escrow Agent and the
Paying Agent, and will provide that the Senior Notes shall be redeemed on a date that is no later than
the tenth Business Day after such notice is given by the Senior Notes Issuer in accordance with the
terms of the Senior Escrow Agreement (the “Special Mandatory Redemption Date”). On the Special
Mandatory Redemption Date, the Escrow Agent shall pay to the Paying Agent for payment to each
Holder of the relevant series of Senior Notes the Special Mandatory Redemption Price for such Holder’s
Senior Notes, and the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to use the Escrowed Property to make such
payments and, concurrently with the payment to such Holders, deliver any excess Escrowed Property
(if any) to the Senior Notes Issuer. Notice of such Special Mandatory Redemption shall be given to the
Holders of the Senior Notes at least five Business Days before the Special Mandatory Redemption Date.

The Senior Escrow Account will not include cash to fund any accrued and unpaid interest owing to
Holders of the Senior Notes, which is included in the Special Mandatory Redemption Price. In the event
that the Special Mandatory Redemption Price payable upon such Special Mandatory redemption of the
Senior Notes exceeds the amount of the applicable Escrowed Property, the Senior Notes Issuer would
be required to fund such amounts from other sources available to it.

The Senior Notes Issuer from time to time, but not more than twice in aggregate, may open one or more
replacement or additional accounts at an alternative bank or financial institution, and may transfer any
portion of the Escrowed Property to any such replacement or additional accounts (a “Transfer”)
without such Transfer being deemed an Escrow Release; provided that the Senior Notes Issuer provides
a substantially equivalent security interest to the Trustee for its benefit and for the benefit of the Holders
over such replacement or additional account or accounts if such security interest was initially granted
in connection with the original Senior Escrow Account; and provided further that use of the funds from
any such account shall be subject to the same conditions as applied to the original Senior Escrow

332


-----

Account. In such an event, any replacement or alternative accounts into which the Escrowed Property
is transferred shall be deemed to be a Senior Escrow Account. Receipt by the Trustee from the Senior
Notes Issuer of an Officer’s Certificate in connection with a Transfer shall constitute deemed consent
by the Trustee for the transfer of the Escrowed Property from the original Senior Escrow Account to a
new Escrow Account.

If at the time of such Special Mandatory Redemption the Senior Notes are listed on the Official List of
the Exchange and the rules of the Exchange so require, the Senior Notes Issuer will notify the Exchange
that the Special Mandatory Redemption has occurred and any relevant details relating to such Special
Mandatory Redemption.

In addition, the conditions applicable to a Special Mandatory Redemption may be waived or modified
by Holders representing a majority in aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes then outstanding.

**Optional Redemption**

Except as described below and except as described under “—Redemption for Taxation Reasons”, the
Senior Notes are not redeemable until       , 2027.

On and after    , 2027, the Senior Notes Issuer may otherwise redeem all or, from time to time, part
of the Senior Notes upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ written notice (except that redemption
notices may be mailed more than 60 days prior to a redemption date if the notice is issued in connection
with a defeasance of the Senior Notes or a satisfaction and discharge of the Senior Indenture), at the
following redemption prices (expressed as a percentage of principal amount) plus accrued and unpaid
interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the applicable redemption date (subject
to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest
payment date), if redeemed during the twelve-month period beginning on       of the years indicated
below:

**Redemption**

**Year** **Price**

2027 ..................................................................................................................................

%
2028 ..................................................................................................................................

%
2029 and thereafter ........................................................................................................... 100.000
%

Prior to      , 2027, the Senior Notes Issuer may on any one or more occasions redeem in the
aggregate up to 40% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes (including the
aggregate principal amount of any Additional Senior Notes of the same series), upon not less than 10
or more than 60 days’ notice, with funds in an aggregate amount not exceeding the Net Cash Proceeds
of one or more Equity Offerings at a redemption price (expressed as a percentage of principal amount)
of     % as of the date of the applicable redemption notice, plus accrued and unpaid interest and
Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the applicable redemption date (subject to the right
of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment
date); provided that:

(3) at least 60% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes (excluding the
aggregate principal amount of any Additional Senior Notes of the same series) issued under the
Senior Indenture remain outstanding after each such redemption; and

(4) the redemption occurs within 180 days after the closing of such Equity Offering.

In addition, prior to    , 2027, the Senior Notes Issuer may redeem all or, from time to time, a part of
the Senior Notes upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice (except that redemption notices

333


-----

may be mailed more than 60 days prior to a redemption date if the notice is issued in connection with a
defeasance of the Senior Notes or a satisfaction and discharge of the Senior Indenture), at a redemption
price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Senior Notes, plus the Applicable Premium and
accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the applicable
redemption date (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest
due on the relevant interest payment date).

**_Optional Redemption upon any Tender Offer_**

In connection with any tender offer, Change of Control Offer or Asset Sale Offer for, or other offer to
purchase, any series of or all the Senior Notes, if holders of not less than 90% of the aggregate principal
amount of the then outstanding Senior Notes or series of Senior Notes validly tender and do not validly
withdraw such Senior Notes or series of Senior Notes in such tender offer and the Senior Notes Issuer,
or any third party making such tender offer in lieu of the Senior Notes Issuer, purchases all the Senior
Notes or series of Senior Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn by such holders, all the
holders of the Senior Notes will be deemed to have consented to such tender or other offer and
accordingly, the Senior Notes Issuer or such third party will have the right upon not less than 10 nor
more than 60 days’ notice following such purchase date, to redeem all Senior Notes or series of Senior
Notes that remain outstanding following such purchase at a price equal to the price paid to each other
holder in such tender offer (which may be less than par and excluding any early tender or incentive fee),
plus, to the extent not included in the tender offer payment, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon,
to, but excluding, the date of such redemption.

**_General_**

Notice of redemption will be provided as set forth under “—Selection and Notice.” In connection with
any redemption of Senior Notes (including with the proceeds from an Equity Offering), any such
redemption may, at the Senior Notes Issuer’s discretion, be subject to one or more conditions precedent.

If the optional redemption date is on or after an interest record date and on or before the related interest
payment date, the accrued and unpaid interest will be paid to the Person in whose name the Senior Note
is registered at the close of business on such record date, and no additional interest will be payable to
Holders whose Notes will be subject to redemption by the Senior Notes Issuer.

If the Senior Notes Issuer elects to redeem the Senior Notes or portions thereof and, in connection with
a satisfaction and discharge or defeasance of the Senior Indenture in accordance with the provisions set
forth under “—Defeasance” or “—Satisfaction and Discharge,” requests that the Trustee distribute to
the Holders amounts deposited in trust with the Trustee (which, for the avoidance of doubt, will include
accrued and unpaid interest to the date fixed for redemption) prior to the date fixed for redemption, the
Senior Notes Issuer may in its sole discretion instruct the Trustee in writing (which may be included in
the applicable redemption notice) to deliver to Holders such amounts deposited with the Trustee either
(i) on or promptly after the date fixed for redemption or (ii) any such earlier payment date as selected
by the Senior Notes Issuer.

**Mandatory Payment; Transactions in the Senior Notes**

Except as described under the caption “Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption,” the
Senior Notes Issuer is not required to make mandatory redemption payments or sinking fund payments
with respect to the Senior Notes. As market conditions warrant, we and our shareholders, including the
Permitted Holders, their respective Affiliates and members of our management, may from time to time
seek to purchase or otherwise transact in our outstanding debt securities or loans, including the Senior
Notes or derivative instruments related thereto, in privately negotiated or open market transactions, by
tender offer or otherwise. Subject to any applicable limitations contained in the agreements governing
our indebtedness, including the Senior Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional

334


-----

Intercreditor Agreement, any purchases made by us may be funded by the use of cash on our balance
sheet or the incurrence of new secured or unsecured debt, including borrowings under our credit
facilities or any other source. The amounts involved in any such purchase transactions, individually or
in the aggregate, may be material. Any such purchases may be with respect to a substantial amount of
a particular class or series of debt, with the attendant reduction in the trading liquidity of such class or
series.

**Selection and Notice**

If less than all of any series of Senior Notes are to be redeemed at any time, the Trustee will select Notes
for redemption on a _pro rata basis (or, in the case of Global Notes, in accordance with DTC’s_
procedures), unless otherwise required by law or applicable stock exchange or depository requirements.
The Trustee will not be liable for any selections made by it in accordance with this paragraph.

Notices of redemption will be delivered electronically or mailed by first-class mail, postage prepaid,
not less than 10 nor more than 60 days prior to the redemption date (except as permitted below), to
Holders of the Senior Notes at their respective addresses as they appear on the registration books of the
Registrar with a copy to the Trustee and the Paying Agent. In the case of Global Notes, such notice of
redemption may be instead sent in accordance with the rules and procedures of the Relevant Clearing
System (as applicable). On and after the redemption date, unless the Senior Notes Issuer defaults in the
payment of the redemption price, interest ceases to accrue on the Senior Notes or the part of the Senior
Notes called for redemption.

If and for so long as the Senior Notes are listed on the Official List of The International Stock Exchange
and to the extent the rules of the Authority so require, the Senior Notes Issuer will notify the Authority
of any such notice to the Holders and, in connection with any redemption, the Senior Notes Issuer will
notify the Authority of any change in the principal amount of Senior Notes outstanding.

If any series of Senior Notes is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that
series of Senior Notes shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. In the case
of a Definitive Registered Note, a new Definitive Registered Note in principal amount equal to the
unredeemed portion of any Definitive Registered Note redeemed in part will be issued in the name of
the Holder thereof upon cancellation of the original Definitive Registered Note. In the case of a Global
Note, an appropriate notation will be made on such Global Note (or otherwise in accordance with the
procedures of the Relevant Clearing System, as applicable) to decrease the principal amount thereof to
an amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof. Subject to the terms of the applicable redemption
notice, Notes called for redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption. If such redemption is
subject to the satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, the related notice may, for the avoidance
of doubt, state that, in the Senior Notes Issuer’s discretion, the redemption date may be delayed until
such time as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied or waived (provided that in no event shall such
date of redemption be delayed to a date later than 60 days after the date on which such notice was sent,
except that redemption notices may be mailed or sent in accordance with the rules and procedures of
the Relevant Clearing System (as applicable) more than 60 days prior to a redemption date if the notice
is issued in connection with a defeasance of the Senior Notes or a satisfaction and discharge of the
Senior Indenture), or such redemption may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that
any or all such conditions shall not have been satisfied or waived by the redemption date, or by the
redemption date so delayed.

**Redemption for Taxation Reasons**

The Senior Notes Issuer may redeem the Senior Notes in whole, but not in part, at any time upon giving
not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior written notice (which notice will be irrevocable) at a
redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, to the date fixed for redemption (a “Tax Redemption Date”) (subject to the right of

335


-----

Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment
date) and all Additional Amounts (as defined below under “—Withholding Taxes”), if any, then due
and which will become due on the Tax Redemption Date as a result of the redemption or otherwise, if
any, if the Senior Notes Issuer determines in good faith that, as a result of:

(3) any change in, or amendment to, the law or treaties (or any regulations, official guidance or
rulings promulgated thereunder) of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined below) affecting
taxation; or

(4) any change in, or amendment to, the existing official position or the introduction of an official
position regarding the application, administration or interpretation of such laws, treaties,
regulations, official guidance or rulings (including by reason of a holding, judgment or order by
a court of competent jurisdiction or a change in published practice)

(each of the foregoing in clauses (1) and (2), a “Change in Tax Law”), a Payor (as defined below) is,
or on the next interest payment date in respect of the Senior Notes would be, required to pay Additional
Amounts with respect to the Senior Notes (but, in the case of a Guarantor, only if the payment giving
rise to such requirement cannot be made by the Senior Notes Issuer or another Guarantor who can make
such payment without the obligation to pay Additional Amounts), and such obligation cannot be
avoided by taking reasonable measures available to the Payor (including, for the avoidance of doubt,
the appointment of a new Paying Agent where this would be reasonable). Such Change in Tax Law
must be publicly announced and become effective on or after the Issue Date (or if the applicable
Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction became a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction on a date after the Issue Date, such
later date). The foregoing provisions shall apply mutatis mutandis to any successor Person, after such
successor Person becomes a party to the Senior Indenture, with respect to a change or amendment
occurring after the time such successor Person becomes a party to the Senior Indenture.

Notice of redemption for taxation reasons will be given in accordance with the procedures described
under “—Selection and Notice”. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of redemption will be
given earlier than 90 days prior to the earliest date on which the Payor would be obligated to make such
payment of Additional Amounts if a payment in respect of the Senior Notes were then due. Prior to the
giving of any notice of redemption the Senior Notes pursuant to the foregoing, the Senior Notes Issuer
will deliver to the Trustee (a) an Officer’s Certificate stating that it is entitled to effect such redemption
and setting forth a statement of facts showing that the conditions precedent to its right to so redeem
have been satisfied and that the Payor cannot avoid its obligation to pay Additional Amounts by taking
reasonable measures available to it and (b) an opinion of an independent tax counsel of recognized
standing to the effect that the Payor has been or will become obligated to pay Additional Amounts as a
result of a Change in Tax Law. The Trustee will accept and shall be entitled to rely on such Officer’s
Certificate and opinion as sufficient evidence of the satisfaction of the conditions precedent described
above, without further inquiry, in which event it will be conclusive and binding on the Holders.

**Withholding Taxes**

All payments made by or on behalf of the Senior Notes Issuer or any Guarantor (including any successor
entity) (each, a “Payor”) in respect of the Senior Notes or with respect to any Note Guarantee, as
applicable, will be made free and clear of and without withholding or deduction for, or on account of,
any Taxes, unless the withholding or deduction of such Taxes is then required by law. If any deduction
or withholding for, or on account of, any Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of:

(3) any jurisdiction from or through which payment on any such Senior Note is made by or on behalf
of the Payor or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein having the
power to tax; or

(4) any other jurisdiction in which a Payor is incorporated or organized, engaged in business for tax
purposes, or otherwise considered to be a resident for tax purposes, or any political subdivision
or governmental authority thereof or therein having the power to tax

336


-----

(each of clause (1) and (2), a “Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction”), will at any time be required by law to
be made from any payments made by or on behalf of the Payor with respect to any Senior Note or any
Note Guarantee, as applicable, including payments of principal, redemption price, interest or premium,
if any, the Payor will pay (together with such payments) such additional amounts as may be necessary
in order that the net amounts received in respect of such payments, after such withholding or deduction
(including any such deduction or withholding from such additional amounts), will equal the amounts
which would have been received in respect of such payments on any such Senior Note or Note
Guarantee, as applicable, in the absence of such withholding or deduction (the “Additional Amounts”);
_provided that no such Additional Amounts will be payable for or on account of:_

(9) any Taxes that would not have been so imposed but for the existence of any present or former
connection between the relevant Holder or beneficial owner (or between a fiduciary, settlor,
beneficiary, member, partner or shareholder of, or possessor of power over the relevant Holder
or beneficial owner, if the relevant Holder or beneficial owner is an estate, nominee, trust,
partnership, limited liability company or corporation) and the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction
(including, without limitation, being resident for tax purposes, or being a citizen or resident or
national of, or carrying on a business or maintaining a permanent establishment in, or being
physically present in, the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction) but excluding, in each case, any
connection arising solely from the acquisition, ownership or holding of such Senior Note or the
receipt of any payment or the exercise or enforcement of rights under such Senior Note or Note
Guarantee;

(10) any Tax that is imposed or withheld by reason of the failure by the Holder or the beneficial owner
of the Senior Note to comply with a reasonable written request by the Payor addressed to the
Holder, after reasonable notice (at least 30 days before any such withholding or deduction would
be made), to provide certification, information, documents or other evidence concerning the
nationality, residence or identity of the Holder or such beneficial owner or to make any
declaration or similar claim or satisfy any other reporting requirement relating to such matters,
which is required by a law, statute, treaty, regulation or administrative practice of the Relevant
Taxing Jurisdiction as a precondition to exemption from, or reduction in the rate of deduction of,
all or part of such Tax but only to the extent the Holder or beneficial owner is legally entitled to
provide such certification or documentation;

(11) any Taxes, to the extent that such Taxes were imposed or withheld as a result of the presentation
of the Senior Note for payment (where Notes are in the form of Definitive Registered Notes and
presentation is required) more than 30 days after the relevant payment is first made available for
payment to the Holder (except to the extent that the Holder would have been entitled to Additional
Amounts had the Senior Note been presented on the last day of such 30-day period);

(12) any Taxes pursuant to or in connection with the Dutch Withholding Tax Act 2021 (Wet
_bronbelasting 2021) as of the date of this Offering Memorandum;_

(13) any Taxes that are payable otherwise than by deduction or withholding from a payment under or
with respect to the Senior Notes or any Note Guarantee;

(14) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, excise, transfer, capital gains, personal property or similar tax,
assessment or other governmental charge;

(15) any Taxes imposed or withheld pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code, as of the
Issue Date (or any amended or successor version of such sections that are substantively
comparable), any regulations promulgated thereunder, any official interpretations thereof, any
intergovernmental agreement between a non-U.S. jurisdiction and the United States with respect
to the foregoing and any law, regulation, or official interpretation thereof implementing such
intergovernmental agreement, or any agreements entered into pursuant to Section 1471(b)(1) of
the Code; or

(16) any combination of the items (1) through (6) above.

337


-----

In addition, no Additional Amounts shall be paid with respect to a Holder who is a fiduciary or a
partnership or any person other than the beneficial owner of the Senior Notes, to the extent that the
beneficiary or settler with respect to such fiduciary, the member of such partnership or the beneficial
owner would not have been entitled to Additional Amounts had such beneficiary, settler, member or
beneficial owner directly held such Senior Notes.

The Payor will (i) make any required withholding or deduction and (ii) remit the full amount deducted
or withheld to the relevant tax authority in the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction in accordance with
applicable law. The Payor will provide certified copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any
Taxes so deducted or withheld to each relevant tax authority in the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction
imposing such Taxes, or if such tax receipts are not available, certified copies of other reasonable
evidence of such payments as soon as reasonably practicable to the Trustee. Such copies shall be made
available to the Holders upon reasonable request and will be made available at the offices of the relevant
Paying Agent.

If any Payor is obligated to pay Additional Amounts under or with respect to any payment made on any
Senior Note or any Note Guarantee, at least 30 days prior to the date of such payment, the Payor will
deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable
and the amount estimated to be so payable and such other information necessary to enable the Paying
Agent to pay Additional Amounts to Holders on the relevant payment date (unless such obligation to
pay Additional Amounts arises less than 45 days prior to the relevant payment date, in which case the
Payor may deliver such Officer’s Certificate as promptly as practicable thereafter). The Trustee shall
be entitled to rely solely on such Officer’s Certificate as conclusive proof that such payments are
necessary.

Wherever in the Senior Indenture, the Senior Notes or this “Description of the Senior Notes” there is
mentioned, in any context:

(5) the payment of principal;

(6) purchase prices in connection with a purchase of Senior Notes;

(7) interest; or

(8) any other amount payable on or with respect to any of the Senior Notes or any Note Guarantee,

such reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such
context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.

The Payor will pay and reimburse the Holder upon demand for any cost, loss or liability that the Holder
incurs in relation to any present or future stamp, issue, registration, court or documentary Taxes, or
similar charges or levies (including any related interest or penalties with respect thereto) or any other
excise, property or similar Taxes or similar charges or levies (including any related interest or penalties
with respect thereto) that arise in a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction from the execution, delivery,
registration, or enforcement of the Senior Notes, any Note Guarantee, the Senior Indenture or any other
document or instrument in relation thereto (other than, in each case, in connection with a transfer of the
Senior Notes after this issuance of Senior Notes).

The foregoing obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Senior Indenture
and any transfer by a Holder or beneficial owner, and will apply mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in
which any successor to a Payor is organized, engaged in business for tax purposes or otherwise resident
for tax purposes, or any jurisdiction from or through which any payment with respect to the Senior
Notes (or any Note Guarantee) is made by or on behalf of such Payor, or any political subdivision or
governmental authority thereof or therein having the power to tax.

338

**Change of Control**

The Senior Indenture will provided that if a Change of Control occurs, subject to the terms of the
covenant described under this heading “—Change of Control,” each Holder will have the right to require
the Senior Notes Issuer to repurchase all or any part (equal to U.S.$200,000 or integral multiples of
U.S.$1,000 in excess thereof, if applicable; provided that Notes of U.S.$200,000 or less may only be
redeemed in whole and not in part) of such Holder’s Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of
the principal amount of the Senior Notes repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional
Amounts, if any, to the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record
date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date); provided, however, that the Senior
Notes Issuer shall not be obligated to repurchase any series of Senior Notes as described under this
heading, “Change of Control,” in the event and to the extent that it has unconditionally exercised its
right to redeem all the Senior Notes of such series and given notice of redemption as described under
“—Optional Redemption”.

Unless the Senior Notes Issuer has exercised its right to redeem all the Senior Notes and given notice
of redemption as described under “—Optional Redemption” and all conditions to such redemption have
been satisfied or waived, no later than the date that is 60 days after any Change of Control, the Senior
Notes Issuer will deliver (or cause to be delivered) a notice (the “Change of Control Offer”)
electronically or by first-class mail, with a copy to the Trustee, to each Holder of the Senior Notes to
the address appearing in the security register or otherwise in accordance with the procedures of the
Relevant Clearing System, as applicable:

(7) stating that a Change of Control has occurred or may occur and that such Holder has the right to
require the Senior Notes Issuer to purchase all or any part of such Holder’s Notes at a purchase
price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of such Senior Notes plus accrued and unpaid
interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase (subject to the
right of Holders of record on a record date to receive interest on the relevant interest payment
date) (the “Change of Control Payment”);

(8) stating the repurchase date (which shall be no earlier than 10 days nor later than 60 days from the
date such notice is mailed) (the “Change of Control Payment Date”);

(9) stating that any Senior Note accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will
cease to accrue interest on the Change of Control Payment Date unless the Change of Control
Payment is not paid, and that any Senior Notes or part thereof not tendered will continue to accrue
interest;

(10) describing the circumstances and relevant facts regarding the transaction or transactions that
constitute the Change of Control;

(11) describing the procedures determined by the Senior Notes Issuer, consistent with the Senior
Indenture, that a Holder must follow in order to have its Notes repurchased; and

(12) if such notice is delivered prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, stating that the Change
of Control Offer and/or the Change of Control Payment is conditional on the occurrence of such
Change of Control and, if applicable, that in the Senior Notes Issuer’s sole discretion, the Change
of Control Payment Date may be delayed until such time (including more than 60 days after the
notice is sent) as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied or waived.

On the Change of Control Payment Date, if the Change of Control shall have occurred, the Senior Notes
Issuer will, to the extent lawful:

(4) accept for payment all Senior Notes or portions thereof properly tendered pursuant to the Change
of Control Offer;

(5) deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of
all Senior Notes so tendered;

339


-----

(6) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating the aggregate
principal amount of Senior Notes or portions of the Senior Notes being purchased by the Senior
Notes Issuer in the Change of Control Offer.

A Holder willing to tender Notes into the Change of Control Offer shall notify its account manager of
its election (or otherwise take action in accordance with the procedures of the Relevant Clearing System
(as applicable)), who shall in turn notify the Paying Agent and the Trustee of such Holder’s election.
Once such tender has been accepted by the Senior Notes Issuer and notified to the Paying Agent, the
Paying Agent shall promptly credit to the bank account of such Holder the Change of Control Payment
for such Senior Notes so tendered and deduct the corresponding amount of such Senior Notes from such
Holder’s account with the Relevant Clearing System.

Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Senior Indenture does not contain
provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Senior Notes Issuer repurchase or redeem the
Senior Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. Holders’ right to require
the Senior Notes Issuer to repurchase Notes upon the occurrence of a Change of Control may deter a
third party from seeking to acquire the Senior Notes Issuer or its Subsidiaries in a transaction that would
constitute a Change of Control.

The Senior Notes Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of
Control if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in
compliance with the requirements set forth in the Senior Indenture applicable to a Change of Control
Offer made by the Senior Notes Issuer and purchases all Senior Notes validly tendered and not
withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditioned upon
the consummation of such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place providing for the
Change of Control at the time the Change of Control Offer is made.

The Senior Notes Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 of
the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of
Senior Notes pursuant to this covenant. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or
regulations conflict with provisions of the Senior Indenture, the Senior Notes Issuer will comply with
the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations
under the Change of Control provisions of the Senior Indenture by virtue of such compliance.
The Senior Notes Issuer’s ability to repurchase Notes issued by it pursuant to a Change of Control Offer
may be limited by a number of factors. The Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement will provide,
and future credit agreements or other agreements to which the Senior Notes Issuer or any Subsidiary
becomes party may provide that certain change of control events with respect to the borrowers
thereunder or the Company, could require a prepayment, repayment or cancellation of such facility. The
Senior Secured Notes will also contain requirements similar to those in the Senior Notes to require the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer to make a change of control offer upon certain changes of control in respect
of the Senior Secured Notes. If we experience a change of control that requires a prepayment, repayment
or cancellation under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement or future Indebtedness, or that
requires an offer to be made to holders of the Senior Secured Notes, we could seek a waiver or seek to
refinance the Senior Secured Credit Facilities or such other Indebtedness or the Senior Secured Notes.
In the event we do not obtain such waiver or do not refinance the Senior Secured Credit Facilities or
such other Indebtedness or the Senior Secured Notes, such failure could cause a default thereunder and
could result in amounts outstanding thereunder to be declared due and payable. Moreover, the exercise
by the Holders of their right to require the Senior Notes Issuer to repurchase the Senior Notes could
cause a default under, or require a repurchase of, such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself
does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Senior Notes Issuer. Finally, the Senior
Notes Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders upon a repurchase may be limited by the Senior Notes
Issuer’s then existing financial resources. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be
available when necessary to make any required repurchases. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the

_Notes, the Note Guarantees and the Collateral—The Issuers may not be able to repurchase the Notes_
_upon a change of control. In addition, under certain circumstances, an Issuer may have the right to_
_purchase all outstanding Notes in connection with a tender offer, even if certain holders do not consent_
_to the tender”._

The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition, in one or a series of related transactions,
of all or substantially all the assets of the Senior Notes Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a
whole to specified other Persons. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase
“substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under
applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether
a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Senior
Notes Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether
a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder may require the Senior Notes Issuer to make
an offer to repurchase the Senior Notes as described above.

The provisions of the Senior Indenture relating to the Senior Notes Issuer’s obligation to make an offer
to repurchase the Senior Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the
written consent of Holders of a majority in outstanding principal amount of the Senior Notes.

**Certain Covenants**

**_Limitation on Indebtedness_**
The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, Incur any Indebtedness
(including Acquired Indebtedness); provided, however, that the Company and any Restricted Subsidiary
may Incur Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) if after giving _pro forma effect to the_
Incurrence of such Indebtedness (including pro forma application of the proceeds thereof), (1) the Fixed
Charge Coverage Ratio for the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries would have been at least 2.0 to
1.0 or (2) the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio for the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries would
have been no greater than 7.5 to 1.0.

The first paragraph of this covenant will not prohibit the Incurrence of the following Indebtedness
(“Permitted Debt”):

(2) Indebtedness Incurred by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary pursuant to any Credit
Facility (including in respect of letters of credit or bankers’ acceptances issued or created
thereunder), and any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof and Guarantees in respect of
such Indebtedness in a maximum aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding not
exceeding:

greater of U.S.$530 million and 75% of Consolidated EBITDA, plus

(b) the maximum amount of Indebtedness that is Secured Indebtedness such that, after giving
_pro forma effect to such Incurrence, the Consolidated Secured Net Leverage Ratio, for the_
Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries would have been no greater than 6.0 to 1.0, plus

(c) in the case of any refinancing of any Indebtedness permitted under this clause (1) or any
portion thereof, the aggregate amount of fees, underwriting discounts, premiums and other
costs and expenses Incurred in connection with such refinancing;

(2) (a) Guarantees by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of Indebtedness of the Company or
any Restricted Subsidiary, so long as the Incurrence of such Indebtedness is permitted to be
Incurred by another provision of this covenant; provided that, if the Indebtedness being guaranteed
is subordinated to the Senior Notes or a Note Guarantee, then the guarantee must be subordinated
to the Senior Notes or such Note Guarantee to the same extent as the Indebtedness being
guaranteed; or (b) without limiting the covenant described under “—Limitation on Liens”,
Indebtedness arising by reason of any Lien granted by or applicable to such Person securing

a Restricted Subsidiary owing to and held by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary (including
the Proceeds Loan); provided, however, that any subsequent issuance or transfer of Capital Stock
or any other event which results in any such Indebtedness being beneficially held by a Person
other than the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary and any sale or other transfer of any such
Indebtedness to a Person other than the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, shall be deemed, in
each case, to constitute an Incurrence of such Indebtedness not permitted by this clause (3) by the
Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be;

(4) (a) Indebtedness represented by (i) the Senior Notes (other than any Additional Senior Notes)
and the related Note Guarantees; and

Incurred under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement or Indebtedness described
in clauses (1), (2), (3) or (4)(a) of this paragraph), outstanding on the Issue Date, in each
case, after giving pro forma effect to the Transactions;

(5) Indebtedness of any Person (i) outstanding on the date on which such Person becomes a Restricted
Subsidiary or is merged, consolidated, amalgamated or otherwise combined with (including
pursuant to any acquisition of assets and assumption of related liabilities) the Company or any
Restricted Subsidiary or (ii) Incurred to provide all or a portion of the funds utilized to
consummate the transaction or series of related transactions pursuant to which any Person became
a Restricted Subsidiary or was otherwise acquired by the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary;
_provided that, with respect to this clause (5), at the time of such acquisition or other transaction_
and after giving pro forma effect to such acquisition or other transaction and to the related
Incurrence of Indebtedness, either (x) the Company would have been able to Incur U.S.$1.00 of
additional Indebtedness pursuant to clause (1) or clause (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant
or to the extent such Indebtedness is Secured Indebtedness, clause (1)(b) of the second paragraph
of this covenant or the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio would not be less than it was immediately
prior to giving effect to such acquisition or other transaction and to the related Incurrence of
Indebtedness, or the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio for the Company and its Restricted
Subsidiaries or (y) to the extent such Indebtedness is Secured Indebtedness, the Consolidated
Secured Net Leverage Ratio, in each case, would not be greater than it was immediately prior to
giving effect to such acquisition or other transaction and to the related Incurrence of Indebtedness;

(6) Indebtedness under Currency Agreements and Interest Rate Agreements not for speculative
purposes (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Company or

refinances, replaces or refunds such Indebtedness, in an aggregate outstanding principal amount

Subsidiary for the purpose of financing such acquisition or disposition); _provided that, in_
connection with a disposition, the maximum liability of the Company and its Restricted
Subsidiaries in respect of all such Indebtedness shall at no time exceed the gross proceeds,

or a Guarantor from the issuance or sale (other than to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary)
of its Subordinated Shareholder Funding or Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock,
Designated Preference Shares or an Excluded Contribution) or otherwise contributed to the equity
(other than through the issuance of Disqualified Stock, Designated Preference Shares or an
Excluded Contribution) of the Senior Notes Issuer or a Guarantor, in each case, subsequent to the
Issue Date; _provided, however, that (i) any such Net Cash Proceeds that are so received or_
contributed shall be excluded for purposes of making Restricted Payments under the first
paragraph and clauses (1) and (10) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—
_Limitation on Restricted Payments” to the extent the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries_
Incur Indebtedness in reliance thereon and (ii) any Net Cash Proceeds that are so received or
contributed shall be excluded for purposes of Incurring Indebtedness pursuant to this clause (14) to

the first paragraph and clauses (1) and (10) of the second paragraph of the covenant described
under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” in reliance thereon; and

(15) Indebtedness consisting of local lines of credit, bilateral facilities, working capital or overdraft

million and 50% of Consolidated EBITDA;

_provided that no more than the greater of U.S.$355 million and 50% of Consolidated EBITDA of_
Indebtedness at any time outstanding pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant may be Incurred
by a Restricted Subsidiary which is not a Guarantor (the “Non-Guarantor Debt Cap”).

For purposes of determining compliance with, and the outstanding principal amount of any particular
Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to and in compliance with, this covenant:

(1) in the event that Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the types of Indebtedness
described in the first and second paragraphs of this covenant, the Senior Notes Issuer, in its sole
discretion, will classify, and may from time to time reclassify, such item of Indebtedness in one
of the clauses of the second paragraph or the first paragraph of this covenant and Indebtedness
permitted by this covenant need not be permitted solely by reference to one provision permitting
such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one such provision and in part by one or more
other provisions of this covenant;

(2) all Indebtedness outstanding under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement on the Issue
Date or the Escrow Release Date shall be deemed initially Incurred under clause (1)(a) of the
second paragraph of this covenant, and such amounts under the Term Facilities (and any
Refinancing Indebtedness in respect of such Term Facilities) may not be reclassified;

(3) Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar
instruments relating to, or Liens securing, Indebtedness that is otherwise included in the
determination of a particular amount of Indebtedness shall not be included;

(4) if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments are
Incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being treated as Incurred pursuant to clause (1),
(7), (11) or (14) of the second paragraph of this covenant or the first paragraph of this covenant

344


-----

and the letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments relate to other
Indebtedness, then such other Indebtedness shall not be included;

(5) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, or
Preferred Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary, will be equal to the greater of the maximum mandatory
redemption or repurchase price (not including, in either case, any redemption or repurchase
premium) or the liquidation preference thereof;

(6) Indebtedness permitted by this covenant need not be permitted solely by reference to one provision
permitting such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one such provision and in part by
one or more other provisions of this covenant permitting such Indebtedness;

(7) for the purposes of determining “Consolidated EBITDA” under this covenant, Consolidated
EBITDA shall be measured at the option of the Senior Notes Issuer on the most recent date on
which new commitments are obtained or the date on which new Indebtedness is Incurred (in the
case of revolving facilities) or the date on which new Indebtedness is Incurred (in the case of term
facilities) and for the period of the most recent four consecutive fiscal quarters ending prior to
such date for which such internal consolidated financial statements of the Senior Notes Issuer or
the SFA Reporting Entity are available; and

(8) the amount of Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than the principal amount thereof will be
equal to the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined on the basis of IFRS.

Accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization
of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness, the payment
of dividends in the form of additional shares of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock or the
reclassification of commitments or obligations not treated as Indebtedness due to a change in IFRS will
not be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of the covenant described under this
“—Limitation on Indebtedness”. The amount of any Indebtedness outstanding as of any date shall be
(a) the accreted value thereof in the case of any Indebtedness issued with original issue discount and
(b) the principal amount, or liquidation preference thereof, in the case of any other Indebtedness.

If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such
Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary as of such date (and, if such
Indebtedness is not permitted to be Incurred as of such date under the covenant described under this
“—Limitation on Indebtedness,” the Senior Notes Issuer shall be in Default of this covenant).

For purposes of determining compliance with any U.S. dollar-denominated restriction on the Incurrence
of Indebtedness, the Dollar Equivalent of the principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in another
currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such
Indebtedness was Incurred, in the case of term Indebtedness, or first committed or first Incurred
(whichever yields the lower Dollar Equivalent), in the case of Indebtedness Incurred under a revolving
credit facility; _provided that (a) if such Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness_
denominated in a currency other than U.S. dollars, and such refinancing would cause the applicable
U.S. dollar-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate
in effect on the date of such refinancing, such U.S. dollar-denominated restriction shall be deemed not
to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not
exceed the amount set forth in clause (2) of the definition of Refinancing Indebtedness; (b) the Dollar
Equivalent of the principal amount of any such Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date shall be
calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the Issue Date; and (c) if any such
Indebtedness that is denominated in a different currency is subject to a Currency Agreement (with
respect to the U.S. dollar) covering principal amounts payable on such Indebtedness, the amount of

345


-----

such Indebtedness expressed in U.S. dollars will be adjusted to take into account the effect of such
agreement.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the
Company or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be
exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of
any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the
Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to
the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of
such refinancing.

**_Limitation on Layering_**

The Company shall not permit any Subsidiary Guarantor to, and no Subsidiary Guarantor shall, incur
any Indebtedness that is or purports to be by its terms (or by the terms of any agreement governing such
Indebtedness) subordinated in right of payment to any Senior Indebtedness of such Subsidiary
Guarantor unless such Indebtedness is pari passu with the Note Guarantee of such Subsidiary Guarantor
or is also by its terms (or by the terms of any agreement governing such Indebtedness) made
subordinated in right of payment to the Note Guarantee of such Subsidiary Guarantor; provided that the
foregoing limitation shall not apply to distinctions between categories of Senior Indebtedness that exist
by reason of any Liens or Guarantees or the ordering of payment for any Liens or the ordering of
payment upon distressed disposals or the enforcement against certain collateral; provided, further, that
Indebtedness under a Credit Facility that is Senior Indebtedness of a Subsidiary Guarantor may provide
for an ordering of payments among the tranches of such Credit Facility.

**_Limitation on Restricted Payments_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, directly or indirectly, to:

(1) declare or pay any dividend or make any other payment or distribution on or in respect of the
Company’s or any Restricted Subsidiary’s Capital Stock (including any payment in connection
with any merger or consolidation involving the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries)
except:

(a) dividends or distributions payable in Capital Stock of the Company (other than Disqualified
Stock) or in options, warrants or other rights to purchase such Capital Stock of the
Company or in Subordinated Shareholder Funding; and

(b) dividends or distributions payable to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary (and, in the
case of any such Restricted Subsidiary making such dividend or distribution, to holders of
its Capital Stock other than the Company or another Restricted Subsidiary on no more than
a pro rata basis, measured by value);

(2) purchase, redeem, retire or otherwise acquire for value any Capital Stock of the Company or any
direct or indirect Parent Entity of the Company held by Persons other than the Company or a
Restricted Subsidiary (other than in exchange for Capital Stock of the Company (other than
Disqualified Stock));

(3) make any principal payment on, or purchase, repurchase, redeem, defease or otherwise acquire or
retire for value, prior to scheduled maturity, scheduled repayment or scheduled sinking fund
payment, any Subordinated Indebtedness (other than (a) any such payment, purchase, repurchase,
redemption, defeasance or other acquisition or retirement or in anticipation of satisfying a sinking
fund obligation, principal installment or final maturity, in each case, due within one year of the
date of payment, purchase, repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other acquisition or retirement
and (b) any Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to clause (3) of the second paragraph of the covenant
described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness”);

(4) make any payment (whether of principal, interest or other amounts) on, or purchase, repurchase,
redeem, defease or otherwise acquire or retire for value any Subordinated Shareholder Funding
(other than any payment of interest thereon in the form of additional Subordinated Shareholder
Funding); or

(5) make any Restricted Investment in any Person,

(each such dividend, distribution, payment, purchase, redemption, repurchase, defeasance, other
acquisition, retirement or Restricted Investment referred to in clauses (1) through (5) is referred to
herein as a “Restricted Payment”), if at the time the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary makes
such Restricted Payment:

(a) an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing (or would result immediately thereafter
therefrom);

(b) the Company is not able to Incur an additional U.S.$1.00 of Indebtedness pursuant to clause (1) of
the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” after giving
effect, on a pro forma basis, to such Restricted Payment; or

(c) the aggregate amount of such Restricted Payment and all other Restricted Payments made
subsequent to the Issue Date (and not returned or rescinded) (including Permitted Payments
permitted below by clauses (5) or (10) of the second paragraph of this covenant, but excluding all
other Restricted Payments permitted by the second paragraph of this covenant) would exceed the
sum of (without duplication):

(i) 50% of Consolidated Net Income for the period (treated as one accounting period) from
the first day of the fiscal quarter commencing immediately after the Issue Date to the end
of the most recent fiscal quarter ending prior to the date of such Restricted Payment for
which internal consolidated financial statements of the Company or the SFA Reporting
Entity are available; provided that such amount shall not be less than zero;

(ii) 100% of the aggregate Net Cash Proceeds, and the fair market value of property or assets
or marketable securities, received by the Company from the issue or sale of its Capital
Stock (other than Disqualified Stock or Designated Preference Shares) or Subordinated

(other than through the issuance of Disqualified Stock or Designated Preference Shares) of
the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary subsequent to the Issue Date (other than
(v) Subordinated Shareholder Funding or Capital Stock in each case sold to a Subsidiary
of the Company, (w) Net Cash Proceeds or property or assets or marketable securities
received from an issuance or sale of such Capital Stock to a Restricted Subsidiary or an
employee stock ownership plan or trust established by the Company or any Subsidiary of
the Company for the benefit of its employees to the extent funded by the Company or any
Restricted Subsidiary, (x) Net Cash Proceeds or property or assets or marketable securities
to the extent that any Restricted Payment has been made from such proceeds in reliance on
clauses (1) or (6) of the second paragraph of this covenant, and (y) Excluded

Company for the benefit of its employees to the extent funded by the Company or any
Restricted Subsidiary) by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary subsequent to the
Issue Date of any Indebtedness that has been converted into or exchanged for Capital Stock
of the Company (other than Disqualified Stock or Designated Preference Shares) or

of property or assets or marketable securities received by the Company or any Restricted
Subsidiary upon such conversion or exchange); but excluding (w) Disqualified Stock or

or marketable securities, received by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary from the
disposition of any Unrestricted Subsidiary or the disposition or repayment of any

Company or a Restricted Subsidiary or an employee stock ownership plan or trust
established by the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company for the benefit of its
employees to the extent funded by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary) or (b) upon

amount equal to the amount of such Guarantee;

(v) in the event that an Unrestricted Subsidiary is designated as a Restricted Subsidiary or all

Subsidiary in respect of such redesignation, merger, consolidation or transfer of assets,
excluding the amount of any Investment in such Unrestricted Subsidiary that constituted a
Permitted Investment made pursuant to clause (11) of the definition of “Permitted
Investment”; and

(vi) 100% of any dividends or distributions received by the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary
after the Issue Date from an Unrestricted Subsidiary;

_provided, however, that no amount will be included in Consolidated Net Income for purposes of_
the preceding clause (i) to the extent that it is (at the Company’s or the Senior Notes Issuer’s
option) included in any of the foregoing clauses (iv), (v) or (vi).

The foregoing provisions will not prohibit any of the following (collectively, “Permitted Payments”):

(1) any Restricted Payment made by exchange (including any such exchange pursuant to the exercise
of a conversion right or privilege in connection with which cash is paid in lieu of the issuance of
fractional shares) for, or out of the proceeds of the substantially concurrent sale or issuance (other

Stock or Designated Preference Shares), Subordinated Shareholder Funding or a substantially
concurrent contribution to the equity (other than through the issuance of Disqualified Stock or
Designated Preference Shares or through an Excluded Contribution) of the Company; provided
that to the extent so applied, the Net Cash Proceeds, or fair market value of property or assets or

such contribution will be excluded from clause (c)(ii) of the preceding paragraph;

(2) any purchase, repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other acquisition or retirement of

Indebtedness, the Indebtedness secured by such Initial Lien for so long as such Indebtedness is so
secured, and (b) in the case of any property or asset that constitutes Collateral, Permitted Collateral
Liens.

Any such Lien created in favor of the Senior Notes pursuant to clause (a)(2) of the preceding paragraph

Company or any Restricted Subsidiary entered into or in connection with such transaction) and
outstanding on such date; provided that, for the purposes of this clause (2), if another Person is
the Successor Company (as defined under “—Merger and Consolidation”), any Subsidiary thereof
or agreement or instrument of such Person or any such Subsidiary shall be deemed acquired or
assumed by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary when such Person becomes the Successor
Company;

thereunder or the proceeds thereof and does not extend to any other asset or property of the
Company or such Restricted Subsidiary or the assets or property of another Restricted

Stock or assets of such Restricted Subsidiary (or the property or assets that are subject to such

-----

Asset Disposition and (ii) the receipt of such Net Available Cash, may be used by the Company or such
Restricted Subsidiary to:

(at such time or in compliance with this covenant) an offer to Holders to purchase their Senior
Notes in accordance with the provisions set forth below for an Asset Disposition Offer for an

Passu Indebtedness; or (ii) prepay, repay, purchase or redeem any Senior Indebtedness, Secured
Indebtedness, Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor or any Indebtedness
that is secured by Liens on assets which do not constitute Collateral (in each case other than
Subordinated Indebtedness of the Senior Notes Issuer or a Guarantor or Indebtedness owed to the
Company or any Restricted Subsidiary);

(2) purchase any series of Senior Notes pursuant to an offer to all Holders of such series of Senior
Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to at least 100% of the principal amount thereof, _plus_
accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the date of
purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest
due on the relevant interest payment date) or by making an Asset Disposition Offer to all Holders
of the Senior Notes (in accordance with the procedures set out below);

(3) invest in any Replacement Assets;

(4) acquire all or substantially all the assets of, or any Capital Stock of, another Similar Business, if,
after giving effect to any such acquisition of Capital Stock, the Similar Business is or becomes a
Restricted Subsidiary;

(5) make a capital expenditure;

(6) acquire other assets (other than Capital Stock and cash or Cash Equivalents) that are used or useful
in a Similar Business;

(7) consummate any combination of the foregoing; or

until the earlier of (x) the date on which such investment is consummated and (y) the 180th day
following the expiration of the aforementioned 630-day period, if the investment has not been
consummated by that date.

The amount of such Net Available Cash not so used as set forth in this paragraph constitutes “Excess
**Proceeds”.** Pending the final application of any such Net Available Cash, the Senior Notes Issuer may
temporarily reduce revolving credit borrowings or otherwise invest such Net Available Cash in any
manner that is not prohibited by the terms of the Senior Indenture. On the 631[st] day after an Asset
Disposition or such earlier time if the Senior Notes Issuer elects, if the aggregate amount of Excess
Proceeds exceeds the greater of U.S.$110 million and 15% of Consolidated EBITDA, the Senior Notes

356


-----

Issuer will be required to make within 30 Business Days thereof an offer (an “Asset Disposition Offer”)
to all Holders and, to the extent the Senior Notes Issuer elects, to all holders of other outstanding Pari
Passu Indebtedness, to purchase the maximum principal amount of Senior Notes and any such Pari
Passu Indebtedness to which the Asset Disposition Offer applies that may be purchased out of the
Excess Proceeds, at an offer price in respect of the Senior Notes in an amount equal to (and, in the case
of any such Pari Passu Indebtedness, an offer price of no more than) 100% of the principal amount of
the Senior Notes and 100% of the principal amount of such Pari Passu Indebtedness, in each case, plus
accrued and unpaid interest, Additional Amounts and applicable prepayment or redemption premium,
if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the
Senior Indenture or the agreements governing such Pari Passu Indebtedness, as applicable, and in the
case of the Senior Notes, in minimum denominations of U.S.$200,000 and in integral multiples of
U.S.$1,000 in excess thereof.

To the extent that the aggregate amount of Senior Notes so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn
pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer and any such Pari Passu Indebtedness so redeemed or repaid is
less than the Excess Proceeds, the Senior Notes Issuer may use any remaining Excess Proceeds for
general corporate purposes or any other purpose not prohibited by the Senior Indenture. If the aggregate
principal amount of the Senior Notes surrendered in any Asset Disposition Offer by Holders and such
other Pari Passu Indebtedness surrendered by holders or lenders, collectively, exceeds the amount of
Excess Proceeds, the Excess Proceeds shall be allocated among the Senior Notes and such Pari Passu
Indebtedness to be repaid or purchased on a pro rata basis on the basis (or, in the case of Global Notes,
in accordance with the procedures of the relevant clearing system) of the aggregate principal amount of
tendered Notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness. For the purposes of calculating the principal amount
of any such Indebtedness not denominated in U.S. dollars, such Indebtedness shall be calculated by
converting any such principal amounts into their Dollar Equivalent determined as of a date selected by
the Senior Notes Issuer that is within the Asset Disposition Offer Period (as defined below). Upon
completion of any Asset Disposition Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero.

To the extent that any portion of Net Available Cash payable in respect of the Senior Notes is
denominated in a currency other than the currency in which the Senior Notes are denominated, the
amount thereof payable in respect of such Senior Notes shall not exceed the net amount of funds in the
currency in which such Senior Notes are denominated that is actually received by the Senior Notes
Issuer upon converting such portion of the Net Available Cash into such currency.

The Asset Disposition Offer, insofar as it relates to the Senior Notes, will remain open for a period of
not less than 20 Business Days following its commencement (the “Asset Disposition Offer Period”).
No later than five Business Days after the termination of the Asset Disposition Offer Period (the “Asset
**Disposition Purchase Date”), the Senior Notes Issuer will purchase the principal amount of Senior**
Notes and, to the extent it elects, Pari Passu Indebtedness required to be purchased by it pursuant to this
covenant (the “Asset Disposition Offer Amount”) or, if less than the Asset Disposition Offer Amount
has been so validly tendered, all Senior Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness validly tendered in response
to the Asset Disposition Offer. On or before the Asset Disposition Purchase Date, the Senior Notes
Issuer will, to the extent lawful, accept for payment, on a pro rata basis to the extent necessary (or, in
the case of Global Notes, in accordance with the procedures of the relevant clearing system), the Asset
Disposition Offer Amount of Senior Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness or portions of Senior Notes and
Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Asset
Disposition Offer, or if less than the Asset Disposition Offer Amount has been validly tendered and not
properly withdrawn, all Senior Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly
withdrawn and, in the case of the Senior Notes, in minimum denominations of U.S.$200,000 and in
integral multiples of U.S.$1,000 in excess thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Senior Notes
Issuer shall be permitted to delay the repayment, prepayment or purchase of Pari Passu Indebtedness
until the last day of the first interest period ended not less than 5 Business Days after the termination of
the Asset Disposition Offer Period.

The Senior Notes Issuer will deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that such Senior
Notes or portions thereof were accepted for payment by the Senior Notes Issuer in accordance with the
terms of this covenant. The Paying Agent shall deliver to the Holders of the relevant Senior Notes the
purchase price of Senior Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn and arrange for the deduction of the
appropriate amounts of Senior Notes from such Holders’ accounts with the Relevant Clearing System
(as applicable). Any Senior Note not so accepted will be promptly mailed or delivered (or transferred
by book-entry or otherwise in accordance with the procedures of the Relevant Clearing System) by the
Senior Notes Issuer to the Holder thereof.

The Senior Notes Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14e-1
of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of
Senior Notes pursuant to the Senior Indenture. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws
or regulations conflict with provisions of this covenant, the Senior Notes Issuer will comply with the
applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under
the Senior Indenture by virtue of such compliance.

Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this covenant, to the extent that (x) a contribution or
distribution of any or all the Net Available Cash of any Asset Disposition by a Subsidiary to the
Company or to a Restricted Subsidiary (to the extent necessary to comply with this covenant) is
prohibited or delayed by applicable local law (including financial assistance and corporate benefit
restrictions and fiduciary and statutory duties of the relevant directors), (y) a contribution or distribution
of any or all the Net Available Cash of any Asset Disposition by a Subsidiary to the Company or to a
Restricted Subsidiary (to the extent necessary to comply with this covenant) could result in material
adverse Tax consequences, as determined by the Company or Issuer in their sole discretion or (z) a
contribution or distribution of any or all the Net Available Cash of any Asset Disposition by a Subsidiary
to the Company or to a Restricted Subsidiary (to the extent necessary to comply with this covenant) is
subject to a contractual encumbrance or restriction affecting the distribution and such encumbrance or
restriction is not prohibited by the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restrictions on
_Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries,” the portion of such Net Available Cash so affected will not_
be required to be applied in compliance with this covenant.

**_Limitation on Affiliate Transactions_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly,
enter into or conduct any transaction or series of related transactions (including the purchase, sale, lease
or exchange of any property or the rendering of any service) with any Affiliate of the Company (any
such transaction or series of related transactions being an “Affiliate Transaction”) involving aggregate
value in excess of the greater of U.S.$55 million and 7.5% of Consolidated EBITDA unless:

(1) the terms of such Affiliate Transaction taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the
Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that could be obtained in
a comparable transaction on an arm’s-length basis at the time of such transaction or the execution
of the agreement providing for such transaction in arm’s-length dealings with a Person who is not
such an Affiliate; and

(2) in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves an aggregate value in excess of the greater of
U.S.$75 million and 10% of Consolidated EBITDA, the terms of such transaction or series of
related transactions have been approved by a resolution of the majority of the disinterested
members of the Board of Directors of the Company or the Senior Notes Issuer resolving that such
transaction complies with clause (1) above.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not apply to:

(1) any Restricted Payment permitted to be made pursuant to the covenant described under “—
_Limitation_ _on Restricted Payments”, any Permitted Payments (other than pursuant to clause_
(9)(b)(ii) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted

358


-----

_Payments”) or any Permitted Investment (other than Permitted Investments as defined in clauses_
(1)(b) and (2) of the definition thereof);

(2) any issuance, transfer or sale of Capital Stock, options, other equity-related interests or other
securities, or other payments, awards or grants in cash, securities or otherwise pursuant to, or the
funding of, or entering into, or maintenance of, any employment, consulting, collective bargaining
or benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement, related trust or other similar agreement and
other compensation arrangements, options, warrants or other rights to purchase Capital Stock of
the Company, any Restricted Subsidiary or any Parent Entity, restricted stock plans, long-term
incentive plans, profit sharing plans, stock appreciation rights plans, participation plans or similar
employee benefits or consultants’ plans (including valuation, health, insurance, deferred
compensation, severance, retirement, savings or similar plans, programs or arrangements) or
indemnities provided on behalf of officers, employees, directors or consultants approved by the
Board of Directors of the Company or the Senior Notes Issuer, in each case in the ordinary course
of business or consistent with past practice or entered into in connection with or as a result of the
Transactions, the Retail Transaction or any transactions of a similar nature to the foregoing that
occur after the Issue Date;

(3) any Management Advances, Management Equity Repurchase and any waiver or transaction with
respect thereto;

(4) any transaction between or among the Company and any Restricted Subsidiary (or entity that
becomes a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such transaction), between or among Restricted
Subsidiaries or between or among the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary and any Receivables
Subsidiary in connection with a Qualified Receivables Financing;

(5) the payment of reasonable fees and reimbursement of expenses to, and customary indemnities
(including under customary insurance policies) and employee benefit and pension expenses
provided on behalf of, directors, officers, consultants or employees of the Company, any
Restricted Subsidiary or any Parent Entity (whether directly or indirectly and including through
any Person owned or controlled by any of such directors, officers or employees);

(6) (i) the Transactions, the Retail Transaction and any transactions of a similar nature to the foregoing
that occur after the Issue Date, (ii) the entry into and performance of obligations of the Company
or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries under the terms of any transaction pursuant to or contemplated
by, and any payments pursuant to or for purposes of funding, any agreement or instrument in
effect as of or on the Issue Date, as these agreements and instruments may be amended, modified,
supplemented, extended, renewed, replaced or refinanced from time to time in accordance with
the other terms of this covenant or to the extent not more materially disadvantageous to the
Holders (taken as a whole), and (iii) the entry into and performance of any registration rights or
other listing agreement;

(7) the execution, delivery and performance of any Tax Sharing Agreement or any arrangement
pursuant to which the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries is required or permitted to
file a consolidated tax return, or the formation and maintenance of any consolidated group for tax,
accounting or cash pooling or management purposes in the ordinary course of business or
consistent with past practice;

(8) transactions with customers, clients, suppliers or purchasers or sellers of goods or services, in each
case in the ordinary course of business or consistent with past practice, which are fair to the
Company or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary in the reasonable determination of the Board of
Directors or an Officer of the Company or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary, or are on terms no
less favorable than those that could reasonably have been obtained at such time from an
unaffiliated party;

(9) any transaction in the ordinary course of business or consistent with past practice between or
among the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary and any Affiliate of the Company or an
Associate or similar entity that would constitute an Affiliate Transaction solely because the

359

Company or a Restricted Subsidiary or any Affiliate of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary
or any Affiliate of any Permitted Holder owns an equity interest in or otherwise controls such
Affiliate, Associate or similar entity;

(10) (a) issuances or sales of Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock or Designated Preference
Shares) of the Company or options, warrants or other rights to acquire such Capital Stock or
Subordinated Shareholder Funding and entering into any proceeds loan in respect of the proceeds
of any issuance of Subordinated Indebtedness; provided that the interest rate and other financial
terms of such Subordinated Shareholder Funding or proceeds loans are approved by a majority of
the members of the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Company or the Senior Notes Issuer
in their reasonable determination and (b) any amendment, waiver or other transaction, including
satisfying payment obligations, with respect to any Subordinated Shareholder Funding or proceeds
loan in compliance with the other provisions of the Senior Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement
or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, as applicable;

(11) (a) payments by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary to any Permitted Holder (whether

for such payments) in respect of this clause (11) are approved by the Board of Directors of the
Senior Notes Issuer or the Company in good faith;

(12) any transactions for which the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary delivers a written letter or
opinion to the Trustee from an Independent Financial Advisor stating that such transaction is
(i) fair to the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary from a financial point of view or (ii) on
terms not less favorable than might have been obtained in a comparable transaction at such time
on an arm’s-length basis from a Person who is not an Affiliate;

avoidance of doubt, any repurchase or purchase, sale or resale, repayment, redemption or prepayment

**_Company Ownership of the Senior Notes Issuer_**

Except in accordance with the covenant described under “—Merger Consolidation,” the Company will
at all times directly own 100% of the Capital Stock of the Senior Notes Issuer.

**_Reports_**

So long as any Senior Notes are outstanding, the Company will furnish to the Trustee the following

(1) within 120 days after the end of the SFA Reporting Entity’s fiscal year beginning with the fiscal
year ending December 31, 2023, annual reports containing: (i) an operating and financial

(ii) unaudited pro forma income statement and balance sheet information of the SFA Reporting

recapitalizations that have occurred since the beginning of the most recently completed fiscal year
as to which such quarterly report relates (unless such pro forma information has been provided in
a previous report pursuant to clause (1) or (3) hereof); _provided that such_ _pro forma financial_

only to the extent available without unreasonable expense, in which case the SFA Reporting Entity

any material changes to the operational risk factors disclosed in the Offering Memorandum or the
most recent annual or quarterly report; provided that the information described in clauses (iii) and
(iv) may be provided in the footnotes to the unaudited financial statements; and

(3) promptly after the occurrence of a material event that the Company announces publicly or any
acquisition, disposition or restructuring, merger or similar transaction that is material to the
Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or change of a senior executive officer
of the Group or a change in auditors of the Reporting Entity, a report containing a description of
such event.

The Company shall have the option at any time to provide the reports set forth in clauses (1) and (2)
above by furnishing such financial information relating to (i) any Parent Entity consolidating reporting
at its level or (ii) the Company and its Subsidiaries. In addition, following an Initial Public Offering of
the Capital Stock of an IPO Entity and/or the listing of such Capital Stock on the Main Market of the
London Stock Exchange (or one or more of the equivalent markets of an international stock exchange),
the requirements of clauses (1), (2) and (3) above shall be considered to have been fulfilled if the IPO
Entity complies with the reporting requirements of such stock exchange; provided that the IPO Entity
shall disclose adjusted EBITDA. The Company, the SFA Reporting Entity or such other entity the
reports of which are delivered pursuant to this paragraph is referred to as the “Reporting Entity”.

The requirement to furnish any of the reports required pursuant to clauses (1), (2) and (3) above may
be satisfied by the posting of such reports within the time periods specified above on Smartroom,
Intralinks or any comparable password protected online data system requiring user identification and a
confidentiality acknowledgement (the “Secured System”). If the Company uses the Secured System to
satisfy such requirements, it shall use commercially reasonable efforts to make available any password
or other login information relating to the Secured System to Holders, bone fide prospective investors
(each, a “Prospective Investor”), security analysts who have certified to the Company that they are
reputable security analysts employed by a reputable financial institution who regularly cover or intend
to cover the Company and the Senior Notes (each, a “Security Analyst”) and market makers who have
certified to the Company that they are reputable market makers who regularly make or intend to make
a market in the Senior Notes (each, a “Market Maker”), and shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to make available on an Investor Relations page on its external website contact information for being
provided access to the Secured System to any Holders, Prospective Investors, Security Analysts or
Market Makers and reasonably promptly comply with any such requests for access to the Secured
System to the extent provided for herein.

Any Person (other than the Trustee) who requests or accesses such financial information required by
this covenant will be required to represent to the Company (to the reasonable good faith satisfaction of
the Company) that:

(iv) it is a Holder, a Beneficial Owner of the Senior Notes, a Prospective Investor, a Market Maker
or Securities Analyst;

362


-----

(v) it will keep such information confidential and will not communicate the information to any
Person; and

(vi) it is not a Person (which includes such Person’s Affiliates) that (1) is principally engaged in a
Similar Business or (2) derives a significant portion of its revenue from operating a Similar
Business.

In addition, to the extent not satisfied by the above, the Company shall furnish to the Holders and to
prospective investors, upon the request of such parties, any information required to be delivered
pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act for so long as the Senior Notes are not freely
transferable under the Exchange Act by persons who are not “affiliates” under the Securities Act.

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, failure by the Senior Notes Issuer to comply with any
of its obligations under this covenant for purposes of clause (3) under “—Events of Default” will not
constitute an Event of Default thereunder until 120 days after the receipt of the written notice delivered
thereunder.

All financial statement information shall be prepared on a basis consistent with IFRS as in effect on the
date of such report or financial statement (or otherwise on the basis of IFRS as then in effect) and on a
consistent basis for the periods presented, except as may otherwise be described in such information;
_provided, however, that the reports set forth in clauses (1), (2) and (3) above may, in the event of a_
change in IFRS, present earlier periods on a basis that applied to such periods. To the extent comparable
prior period financial information of the Reporting Entity does not exist, the comparable prior period
financial information of Ardonagh Midco 2 plc and its Subsidiaries or The Ardonagh Group Limited
and its Subsidiaries, if available, may be provided in lieu thereof. No report need include separate
financial statements for any Subsidiaries of the Company. In addition, the reports set forth above will
not be required to contain any reconciliation to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

At any time that any of the Company’s subsidiaries are Unrestricted Subsidiaries and any such
Unrestricted Subsidiary or a group of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, constitutes a
Significant Subsidiary of the Company, then the quarterly and annual financial information required by
the first paragraph of this covenant will include a reasonably detailed presentation, either on the face of
the financial statements or in the footnotes thereto, of the financial condition and results of operations
of the Reporting Entity and the Restricted Subsidiaries separate from the financial condition and results
of operations of the Unrestricted Subsidiaries.

All reports provided pursuant to this covenant shall be made in the English language.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that (i) the Company or the Senior Notes Issuer becomes
subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, or elects to comply
with such provisions, for so long as it continues to file the reports required by Section 13(a) with the
SEC, or (ii) the Company elects to provide to the Trustee reports which, if filed with the SEC, would
satisfy (in the good faith judgment of the Company) the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or
15(d) of the Exchange Act (other than the provision of U.S. GAAP information, certifications, exhibits
or information as to internal controls and procedures), for so long as it elects, the Company will make
available to the Trustee such annual reports, information, documents and other reports that the Company
is, or would be, required to file with the SEC pursuant to such Section 13(a) or 15(d) or, the Company
will be deemed to have furnished such reports referred to above to the Trustee and the Holders if it has
filed (or, in the case of an Item 2.02 or Item 7.01 Form 8-K, furnished) such reports with the SEC and
such reports are publicly available. Upon complying with the foregoing requirement, the Company will
be deemed to have complied with the provisions contained in this covenant.

363


-----

**_Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status_**

If on any date following the Issue Date, the Senior Notes have achieved Investment Grade Status and
no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing (a “Suspension Event”), then, beginning
on that day and continuing until such time, if any, at which the Senior Notes cease to have Investment
Grade Status (the “Reversion Date”), the provisions of the Senior Indenture summarized under the
following captions will not apply to the Senior Notes:

(1) “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”;

(2) “—Limitation on Indebtedness”;

(3) “—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries”;

(4) “—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions”;

(5) “—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock”;

(6) “—Limitation on Additional Guarantees”;

(7) the provisions of clause (3) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Merger and
_Consolidation—The Senior Notes Issuer”; and_

(8)  the provisions of clause (3) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Merger and
_Consolidation—The Company.”_

And, in each case, any related default provision of the Senior Indenture will cease to be effective and
will not be applicable to the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries.

Such covenants and any related default provisions will again apply according to their terms from the
first day on which a Suspension Event ceases to be in effect. Such covenants will not, however, be of
any effect with regard to actions of the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries properly taken
during the continuance of the Suspension Event, and no action taken prior to the Reversion Date will
constitute a Default or Event of Default. The covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted
_Payments” will be interpreted as if it has been in effect since the date of the Senior Indenture but not_
during the continuance of the Suspension Event. On the Reversion Date, all Indebtedness Incurred
during the continuance of the Suspension Event will be deemed to have been outstanding on the Issue
Date or the Escrow Release Date (as the case may be), so that it is classified as permitted under clause
(4)(b) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness.” In
addition, the Senior Indenture will also permit, without causing a Default or Event of Default, the
Company or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to honor any contractual commitments or take actions
in the future after any date on which the Senior Notes cease to have an Investment Grade Status as long
as the contractual commitments were entered into during the Suspension Event and not in anticipation
of the Senior Notes no longer having an Investment Grade Status. The Senior Notes Issuer shall notify
the Trustee in writing that the conditions set forth in the first paragraph under this caption have been
satisfied; provided that no such notification shall be a condition for the suspension of the covenants
described under this caption to be effective. There can be no assurance that the Senior Notes will ever
achieve or maintain an Investment Grade Status.

**_Impairment of Security Interest_**

The Company and Topco shall not, and the Company shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, take
or knowingly or negligently omit to take any action that would have the result of materially impairing
the Security Interest with respect to the Collateral (it being understood, subject to the paragraph below,
that the Incurrence of Permitted Collateral Liens shall under no circumstances be deemed to materially
impair the Security Interests with respect to the Collateral) for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders,
and the Company and Topco shall not, and the Company shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to,
grant to any Person other than the Security Agent, for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders and the

364


-----

other beneficiaries described in the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement, any interest whatsoever in any of the Collateral.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the Company, Topco and the Restricted Subsidiaries may Incur
Permitted Collateral Liens, (ii) the Collateral may be discharged and released in accordance with the
Senior Indenture, the applicable Security Documents or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement; (iii) the applicable Security Documents may be amended from time to time to
cure any ambiguity, mistake, omission, defect, error or inconsistency therein; (iv) the Company, Topco
and the Restricted Subsidiaries may discharge and release Security Interests with respect to the
Collateral in connection with the implementation of a Permitted Reorganization; and (v) the Security
Interests, and the related Security Documents may be (A) amended, extended, renewed, restated,
supplemented or otherwise modified or released followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien of at least
equivalent ranking over the same assets or (B) otherwise amended, extended, renewed, restated,
supplemented or otherwise modified in any manner that does not materially adversely after the Holders;
_provided, however, that in the case of clause (v) above, the Security Documents may not be amended,_
extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, released or modified or replaced; unless,
contemporaneously with any such action, the Senior Notes Issuer delivers to the Trustee either (1) a
solvency opinion, in form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, from an Independent Financial Advisor
confirming the solvency of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole or of Topco and its
subsidiaries, taken as a whole (as applicable), and of the person granting such Security Interest, in each
case, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement,
supplement, release, modification or replacement, (2) a certificate from the Board of Directors of the
relevant Person, in form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, which confirms the solvency of the
person granting such Security Interest, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment,
extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement, or (3) an Opinion of
Counsel, in form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, confirming that, after giving effect to any
transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release,
modification or replacement, the Lien or Liens created under the Security Documents, as so amended,
extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, released, modified or replaced, are valid Liens not
otherwise subject to any limitation, imperfection or new hardening period, in equity or at law, to which
such Lien or Liens were not otherwise subject immediately prior to such amendment, extension,
renewal, restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement. In the event that the Senior
Notes Issuer complies with the requirements of this covenant, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall
(subject to each of the Trustee and the Security Agent being indemnified and secured to its satisfaction)
consent to such amendments without the need for instructions from the Holders and the Security Agent
(and if required the Trustee) shall enter into any documents or take any such actions in connection
therewith.

**_Limitation on Additional Guarantees_**

No Restricted Subsidiary shall Guarantee the Indebtedness outstanding under the Senior Secured Credit
Facilities Agreement, any Credit Facility that replaces the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement
or any Public Debt, in each case, of the Senior Notes Issuer or a Guarantor unless such Restricted
Subsidiary is or becomes a Guarantor within 20 Business Days of the date on which such Guarantee is
Incurred and, if necessary, executes and delivers to the Trustee a supplemental indenture in the form
attached to the Senior Indenture pursuant to which such Restricted Subsidiary will provide a Note
Guarantee; provided, however, that such Restricted Subsidiary shall not be obligated to become such a
Guarantor to the extent and for so long as the Incurrence of such Note Guarantee is contrary to the
Agreed Security Principles or could give rise to or result in: (1) any breach or violation of statutory
limitations, corporate benefit, financial assistance, fraudulent preference, thin capitalization rules,
capital maintenance rules, guidance and coordination rules or the laws, rules or regulations (or
analogous restriction) of any applicable jurisdiction; (2) any risk or liability for the officers, directors
or (except in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership) shareholders of such Restricted
Subsidiary (or, in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership, directors or shareholders of

365


-----

the partners of such partnership); (3) any cost, expense, liability or obligation other than reasonable outof-pocket expenses or (4) is inconsistent with the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement. At the option of the Senior Notes Issuer, any Note Guarantee may contain
limitations on Guarantor liability to the extent reasonably necessary to recognize certain defenses
generally available to guarantors (including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer,
voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose, capital maintenance or similar laws,
regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other considerations under
applicable law.

Future Note Guarantees granted pursuant to this provision shall be released as set forth under “—
_Releases of the Note Guarantees.” A Note Guarantee of a future Guarantor may also be released at the_
option of the Senior Notes Issuer if at the date of such release there is no Indebtedness of such Guarantor
outstanding which was Incurred after the Issue Date and which could not have been Incurred in
compliance with the Senior Indenture if such Guarantor had not been designated as a Guarantor. The
Trustee and the Security Agent shall execute any documents or each take all necessary actions,
including the granting of releases or waivers under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement, to effectuate any release of a Note Guarantee reasonably requested by the
Senior Notes Issuer in accordance with these provisions, subject to each of the Trustee and the Security
Agent being indemnified and secured to its satisfaction.

**_Additional Intercreditor Agreements_**

The Senior Indenture will provide that, at the request of the Company or Topco, in connection with the
Incurrence by the Company or its Restricted Subsidiaries of any (1) Indebtedness permitted pursuant to
the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” or (2) any Refinancing Indebtedness in
respect of Indebtedness referred to in the foregoing clause (1) Topco, the Company, the relevant
Restricted Subsidiaries, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall (without the consent of the Holders)
enter into with the holders of such Indebtedness (or their duly authorized Representatives) an
intercreditor agreement (an “Additional Intercreditor Agreement”) or a restatement, amendment or
other modification of the existing Intercreditor Agreement on substantially the same terms as the
Intercreditor Agreement (or terms not materially less favorable to the Holders (taken as a whole)),
including containing substantially the same terms with respect to release of Note Guarantees and
priority and release of the Security Interests; provided that such Additional Intercreditor Agreement
will not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or Security Agent or, in the opinion of the
Trustee or Security Agent, as applicable, adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of
the Trustee or Security Agent under the Senior Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Senior Indenture also will provide that, at the direction of the Senior Notes Issuer or the Company
and without the consent of Holders, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall from time to time enter
into one or more amendments to any Intercreditor Agreement to: (1) cure any ambiguity, omission,
defect, error or inconsistency of any such agreement, (2) increase the amount or types of Indebtedness
covered by any such agreement that may be Incurred by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary that
is subject to any such agreement (including, with respect to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional
Intercreditor Agreement, the addition of provisions relating to new Indebtedness ranking junior in right
of payment to the Senior Notes), (3) add Restricted Subsidiaries to the Intercreditor Agreement or an
Additional Intercreditor Agreement, (4) further secure the Senior Notes or any of the Senior Secured
Credit Facilities as is otherwise not prohibited by the Senior Indenture (including Additional Senior
Notes or Incremental Facilities), make provision for equal and ratable pledges of the Collateral to secure
Additional Senior Notes or Incremental Facilities, (6) implement any Permitted Collateral Liens,
(7) amend the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement in accordance with
the terms thereof or (8) make any other change to any such agreement that does not materially adversely
affect the Holders (taken as a whole). In formulating its opinion on such matters, the Trustee shall be
entitled to request and rely absolutely on such evidence as it deems appropriate, including an Officer’s
Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel. Neither the Senior Notes Issuer nor the Company shall otherwise

366


-----

direct the Trustee or the Security Agent to enter into any amendment to any Intercreditor Agreement
without the consent of the Holders of the majority in aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes
then outstanding, except as otherwise permitted below under “—Amendments and Waivers”, and the
Senior Notes Issuer and the Company may only direct the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into
any amendment to the extent such amendment does not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee
or Security Agent or, in the opinion of the Trustee or Security Agent, adversely affect their respective
rights, duties, liabilities or immunities under the Senior Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The Senior Indenture will also provide that, in relation to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional
Intercreditor Agreement, the Trustee (and the Security Agent, if applicable) shall consent on behalf of
the Holders to the payment, repayment, purchase, repurchase, defeasance, acquisition, retirement or
redemption of any obligations subordinated to the Senior Notes thereby; provided that such transaction
would comply with the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” and the terms
of the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The Senior Indenture will also provide that each Holder, by accepting a Senior Note, shall be deemed
to have agreed to and accepted the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement (whether then entered into or entered into in the future pursuant to
the provisions described herein), and to have directed the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into
any such Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

**Merger and Consolidation**

**_The Company_**

The Company will not, directly or indirectly, consolidate with or merge with or into, or assign, convey,
transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all its assets as an entirety or substantially as
an entirety, in one transaction or a series of related transactions to, any Person, unless:

(1) either the Company is the surviving entity, or the resulting, surviving or transferee Person (the
“Successor Company”) will be a Person organized and existing under the laws of any member
state of the European Union, the United Kingdom, Jersey, the Cayman Islands, any State of the
United States of America or the District of Columbia, Canada or any province of Canada and the
Successor Company (if not the Company) will expressly assume (a) by supplemental indenture,
executed and delivered to the Trustee, in form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, all the
obligations of the Company under the Senior Notes and the Senior Indenture and (b) all
obligations of the Company under the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement, the Proceeds Loan and the Security Documents, as applicable;

(2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness that becomes
an obligation of the Successor Company or any Subsidiary of the Successor Company as a result
of such transaction as having been Incurred by the Successor Company or such Subsidiary at the
time of such transaction), no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing;

(3) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, either (a) the Company or the Successor
Company would be able to Incur at least an additional U.S.$1.00 of Indebtedness pursuant to
clause (1) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness”
or (b) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the Company or the Successor Company for the most
recently ended four full fiscal quarters for which financial statements are available immediately
preceding the date on which the transaction is consummated would not be less than it was
immediately prior to giving effect to such transaction; and

(4) the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of
Counsel, each to the effect that such consolidation, merger or transfer and such supplemental

367


-----

indenture (if any is required in connection with such transaction) comply with the Senior
Indenture; _provided that in giving an Opinion of Counsel, counsel may rely on an Officer’s_
Certificate as to any matters of fact.

Without prejudice to clause (3) in the immediately preceding paragraph, any Indebtedness that becomes
an obligation of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary (or that is deemed to be Incurred by any
Restricted Subsidiary that becomes a Restricted Subsidiary) as a result of any such transaction
undertaken in compliance with this covenant, and any Refinancing Indebtedness with respect thereto,
shall be deemed to have been Incurred in compliance with the covenant described under “—Limitation
_on Indebtedness”._

The Successor Company will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power
of, the Company under the Senior Indenture and the Senior Notes.

There is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law.
Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular
transaction would involve “all or substantially all” of the properties or assets of a Person.

**_The Senior Notes Issuer_**

The Senior Notes Issuer will not, directly or indirectly, consolidate with or merge with or into, or assign,
convey, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all its assets as an entirety or
substantially as an entirety, in one transaction or a series of related transactions to, any Person, unless:

(1) either the Senior Notes Issuer is the surviving entity, or the resulting, surviving or transferee
Person (the “Successor Issuer”) will be a Person organized and existing under the laws of any
member state of the European Union, the United Kingdom, Jersey, the Cayman Islands, any State
of the United States of America or the District of Columbia, Canada or any province of Canada
and the Successor Company (if not the Senior Notes Issuer) will expressly assume (a) by
supplemental indenture, executed and delivered to the Trustee, in form reasonably satisfactory to
the Trustee, all the obligations of the Senior Notes Issuer under the Senior Notes and the Senior
Indenture and (b) all obligations of the Senior Notes Issuer under the Intercreditor Agreement, any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the Senior Escrow Agreement, the Proceeds Loan and the
Security Documents, as applicable;

(2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness that becomes
an obligation of the Successor Issuer or any Subsidiary of the Successor Issuer as a result of such
transaction as having been Incurred by the Successor Issuer or such Subsidiary at the time of such
transaction), no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing;

(3) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, either (a) the Senior Notes Issuer or the
Successor Issuer would be able to Incur at least an additional U.S.$1.00 of Indebtedness pursuant
to clause (1) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on
_Indebtedness” or (b) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the Senior Notes Issuer or the Successor_
Issuer for the most recently ended four full fiscal quarters for which financial statements are
available immediately preceding the date on which the transaction is consummated would not be
less than it was immediately prior to giving effect to such transaction; and

(4) the Senior Notes Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion
of Counsel, each to the effect that such consolidation, merger or transfer and such supplemental
indenture (if any is required in connection with such transaction) comply with the Senior
Indenture; _provided that in giving an Opinion of Counsel, counsel may rely on an Officer’s_
Certificate as to any matters of fact.

Without prejudice to clause (3) in the immediately preceding paragraph, any Indebtedness that becomes
an obligation of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary (or that is deemed to be Incurred by any
Restricted Subsidiary that becomes a Restricted Subsidiary) as a result of any such transaction

368


-----

undertaken in compliance with this covenant, and any Refinancing Indebtedness with respect thereto,
shall be deemed to have been Incurred in compliance with the covenant described under “—Limitation
_on Indebtedness”._

The Successor Issuer will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power
of, the Senior Notes Issuer under the Senior Indenture and the Senior Notes.

There is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law.
Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular
transaction would involve “all or substantially all” of the properties or assets of a Person.

**_The Subsidiary Guarantors_**

No Subsidiary Guarantor (other than a Subsidiary Guarantor whose Note Guarantee is to be released in
accordance with the terms of the Senior Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement) may:

(1) consolidate with or merge with or into any Person (whether or not such Subsidiary Guarantor is
the surviving corporation);

(2) sell, assign, convey, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all its assets as an
entirety or substantially as an entirety, in one transaction or a series of related transactions, to any
Person; or

(3) permit any Person to merge with or into it

unless:

(a) the other Person is the Senior Notes Issuer, the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary that
is a Guarantor or becomes a Guarantor substantially concurrently with such consolidation,
merger, sale, assignment, conveyance, transfer, lease or other disposal;

(b) (1) either (x) a Guarantor is the continuing Person or (y) the resulting, surviving or
transferee Person expressly assumes all the obligations of the Guarantor under its Note
Guarantee and the Senior Indenture (pursuant to a supplemental indenture executed and
delivered in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee) and all obligations of the
Guarantor under the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and
the Security Documents, as applicable; and (2) immediately after giving effect to the
transaction, no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing; or

(c) the transaction constitutes a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or
merger) of a Guarantor or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of a
Guarantor (in each case other than to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary) otherwise
permitted by the Senior Indenture;

_provided, however, that the prohibition in clauses (1), (2) and (3) above shall not apply to the extent_
that compliance with clauses (a) and (b)(1) could give rise to or result in: (1) any breach or violation of
statutory limitations, corporate benefit, financial assistance, fraudulent preference, thin capitalization
rules, capital maintenance rules, guidance and coordination rules or the laws, rules or regulations (or
analogous restriction) of any applicable jurisdiction; (2) any risk or liability for the officers, directors
or (except in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership) shareholders of such Restricted
Subsidiary (or, in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership, directors or shareholders of
the partners of such partnership); or (3) any cost, expense, liability or obligation (including with respect
to any Taxes) other than reasonable out-of-pocket expenses.

369


-----

**_General_**

The provisions set forth in this covenant shall not restrict (and shall not apply to): (i) any Restricted
Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor from consolidating with, merging or liquidating into or transferring
all or substantially all its properties and assets to the Senior Notes Issuer, a Guarantor or any other
Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor; (ii) any Guarantor from merging or liquidating into or
transferring all or part of its properties and assets to the Senior Notes Issuer or another Guarantor;
(iii) any consolidation or merger of the Senior Notes Issuer into any Guarantor; provided that, if the
Senior Notes Issuer is not the surviving entity of such merger or consolidation, the relevant Guarantor
will assume the obligations of the Senior Notes Issuer under the Senior Notes, the Senior Indenture, the
Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents, and
clauses (1) and (4) under the heading “—The Senior Notes Issuer” shall apply to such transaction; or
(iv) the Senior Notes Issuer or any Guarantor consolidating into or merging or combining with an
Affiliate incorporated or organized for the purpose of changing the legal domicile of such entity,
reincorporating such entity in another jurisdiction, or changing the legal form of such entity; provided,
_however, that clauses (1), (2) and (4) under the heading “—The Company,” clauses (1), (2) and (4) under_
the heading “—The Senior Notes Issuer” or clauses (a) and (b) under the heading “—The Guarantors,”
as the case may be, shall apply to any such transaction.

Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, this covenant will not apply to the Transactions or the Retail
Transaction.

**Financial Calculations**

If any amount is incurred or utilized under any Consolidated EBITDA or ratio-based basket, such
amount shall be permitted notwithstanding any subsequent change in Consolidated EBITDA, the
Consolidated Secured Net Leverage Ratio, the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio, the Fixed Charge
Coverage Ratio or any other financial ratio or metric. If (x) a proposed action, matter, transaction or
amount (or a portion thereof) is incurred or entered into pursuant to a fixed basket or the grower
component of any other basket and (y) at a later time would subsequently be permitted under a ratiobased basket, unless otherwise elected by the Company, such action, matter, transaction or amount (or
a portion thereof) shall automatically be reclassified to such ratio-based basket.

In the event that any amount or transaction meets the criteria of more than one of the baskets or
exceptions set out in the Senior Indenture, the Company, in its sole discretion, will classify and may
from time to time reclassify that amount or transaction to a particular basket or exception and will only
be required to include that amount or transaction in one of those baskets or exceptions (and, for the
avoidance of doubt, an amount or transaction may at the option of the Company be split between
different baskets or exceptions).

Any reference in the Senior Indenture to an Applicable Metric shall be deemed to be a reference to such
Applicable Metric as determined at the Applicable Test Date.

In relation to any action, matter or transaction (including an Investment or permitted acquisition) which
would result in a cumulative increase to Consolidated EBITDA of the Group (in an amount as confirmed
by the Company by reference to the date of commitment thereto after giving pro forma effect thereof
and any adjustments permitted by the Senior Indenture) (each a “Qualifying Transaction”), from such
date until the date on which the internal consolidated financial statements of the Company or the SFA
Reporting Entity falling immediately after completion of that Qualifying Transaction are available, the
Consolidated Pro Forma EBITDA of the Group for the purposes of all baskets, ratios and thresholds in
this Agreement which include a calculation by reference to Consolidated EBITDA shall be increased
(on a pro forma basis) by such amount confirmed by the Company. If the value of any of the baskets,
ratios or thresholds is subsequently decreased upon such internal consolidated financial statements of
the Company or the SFA Reporting Entity becoming available immediately following completion of
that Qualifying Transaction, any item undertaken or incurred in good faith prior to any decrease shall

370


-----

be grandfathered and shall continue to be permitted notwithstanding the subsequent reduction in the
relevant baskets, ratios or thresholds.

For any relevant basket set by reference to a financial year, fiscal year, calendar year or fixed period
(each an “Annual Period”):

(iii) at the option of the Company, the maximum amount so permitted under such basket during
such Annual Period may be increased by:

(C) an amount equal to 100% of the difference (if positive) between the permitted amount
in the immediately preceding Annual Period and the amount thereof actually used or
applied by the Group during such preceding Annual Period (the “Carry Forward
**Amount”); and/or**

(D) an amount equal to 50% of the permitted amount in the immediately following Annual
Period and the permitted amount in such immediately following Annual Period shall
be reduced by such corresponding amount (the “Carry Back Amount”); and

(iv) to the extent that the maximum amount so permitted under such basket during such Annual
Period is increased in accordance with paragraph (i) above, any usage of such basket during
such Annual Period shall be deemed to be applied in the following order:

(D) firstly against any Carry Forward Amount;

(E) secondly against the maximum amount so permitted during such Annual Period prior
to any increase in accordance with paragraph (i) above; and

(F) thirdly against any Carry Back Amount.

To the extent that any Indebtedness, Lien, distribution, payment or Investment or other transaction
referred to in or contemplated by the definition of Applicable Test Date, satisfies any Applicable Metric,
or other test or condition on the Applicable Test Date, such Applicable Metric, test or condition shall
be deemed to have been satisfied, including on the date of its incurrence or on any other date of
determination under the Senior Indenture and irrespective of any facts or circumstances (including
financial condition) on any such date or thereafter.

Where any Applicable Metric is calculated in connection with the incurrence of any Permitted
Indebtedness and/or the granting of any Permitted Lien, such Applicable Metric may be calculated on
a pro forma basis for:

(iii) the use of the proceeds of such Permitted Indebtedness (including, for the avoidance of doubt,
any anticipated increase to Consolidated EBITDA attributable to any Purchase or other
transaction to be funded in whole or in part from such Permitted Indebtedness); and

(iv) the incurrence and use of the proceeds of any other Permitted Indebtedness in respect of which
the Applicable Test Date has occurred.

Subject to the sixth paragraph under the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness,” the
exchange rates used in the calculation of any Applicable Metric shall be, at the sole election of the
Company, from time to time:

(vi) such rate taking into account any cross currency derivatives entered into by the Group in
respect of such amounts,

371


-----

(vii) the weighted average exchange rates for the relevant period,

(viii) the spot rate of exchange on the relevant date (elected and determined by the Company acting
reasonably and in good faith),

(ix) the spot rate of exchange on the Issue Date (elected and determined by the Company acting
reasonably and in good faith), or

(x) otherwise consistent with the exchange rate methodology applied in the Quarterly Financial
Statements or, as the case may be, the Annual Financial Statements for the applicable fourquarter reference period.

Any calculation or measure that is determined with reference to the Company’s financial statements
(including, without limitation, Consolidated EBITDA, Consolidated Interest Expense, Consolidated
Net Income, Consolidated Secured Net Leverage, Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio, Fixed Charge
Coverage Ratio and Fixed Charges), in the sole discretion of the Company, may be determined with
reference to the financial statements of the SFA Reporting Entity (and including, for the avoidance of
doubt and without double-counting, amounts related to any Indebtedness of the Company and the
Restricted Subsidiaries which is not already included therein) or a Parent Entity of the Company instead,
so long as, in the case of a Parent Entity, such Parent Entity does not hold any material assets other than,
directly or indirectly, the Equity Interests of the Company (as determined by the Board of Directors or
an Officer of the Company or the Senior Notes Issuer in good faith).

**Events of Default**

Each of the following is an “Event of Default” under the Senior Indenture:

(1) default in any payment of interest on any Senior Note issued under the Senior Indenture when due
and payable, continued for 30 days;

(2) default in the payment of the principal amount of or premium, if any, on any Senior Note issued
under the Senior Indenture when due at its Stated Maturity, upon optional redemption, upon
required repurchase, upon declaration or otherwise;

(3) failure by Topco (only with respect to the covenants under the headings “—Certain Covenants—
_Impairment of Security Interests” and “—Certain Covenants Additional Intercreditor_
_Agreements”), the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary to comply for 60 days after notice by_
the Trustee or the Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes with its
other agreements contained in the Senior Indenture;

(4) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by which
there may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Company or any
of its Restricted Subsidiaries (or the payment of which is Guaranteed by the Company or any of
its Restricted Subsidiaries), other than Indebtedness owed to the Company or a Restricted
Subsidiary, which:

(a) is caused by a failure to pay principal at stated maturity on such Indebtedness, immediately
upon the expiration of the grace period provided in such Indebtedness (“payment default”);
or

(b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its maturity (the “cross-acceleration
provision”),

372


-----

and in each case, the principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the principal
amount of any other such Indebtedness under which there has been a payment default or the
maturity of which has been so accelerated, aggregates the greater of U.S.$180 million and 25% of
Consolidated EBITDA or more and any such Default continues for more than 20 Business Days;

(5) other than on a solvent basis, certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or court protection of the
Company or a Significant Subsidiary or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as
of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Company), would constitute a
Significant Subsidiary (the “bankruptcy provisions”);

(6) failure by the Company or any Significant Subsidiary or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that,
taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Company), would
constitute a Significant Subsidiary to pay final judgments aggregating in excess of the greater of
U.S.$180 million and 25% of Consolidated EBITDA (exclusive of any amounts for which a
solvent insurance company has acknowledged liability), which judgments are not paid, discharged
or stayed for a period of 60 days after the judgment becomes final (the “judgment default
**provision”);**

(7) any Security Interest under the Security Documents shall, at any time, cease to be in full force and
effect (other than in accordance with the terms of the relevant Security Document, the Intercreditor
Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Senior Indenture) with respect to
Collateral having a fair market value in excess of the greater of U.S.$15 million and 2% of
Consolidated EBITDA for any reason other than the satisfaction in full of all obligations under
the Senior Indenture or the release of any such Security Interest in accordance with the terms of
the Senior Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the
Security Documents or any such security interest created thereunder shall be declared invalid or
unenforceable or the Company, Topco or any Restricted Subsidiary shall assert in writing that any
such security interest is invalid or unenforceable, and any such Default continues for 10 days (the
“security default provision”);

(8) any Note Guarantee of a Significant Subsidiary ceases to be in full force and effect (other than in
accordance with the terms of such Note Guarantee, the Senior Indenture, the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) or is declared invalid or unenforceable in
a judicial proceeding or any Guarantor denies or disaffirms in writing its obligations under its
Note Guarantee, and any such Default continues for 10 days (the “guarantee provision”); and

(9) the failure by the Senior Notes Issuer to consummate the Special Mandatory Redemption to the
extent required, as described under “Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.”

If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in clause (5) above) occurs and is
continuing, the Trustee, by notice to the Senior Notes Issuer, or the Holders of at least 30% in principal
amount of the outstanding Notes under the Senior Indenture, by written notice to the Senior Notes Issuer
and the Trustee, may, and the Trustee at the request of such Holders shall, declare the principal of,
premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest on all the Senior Notes under the Senior Indenture to
be due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such principal, premium and accrued and unpaid interest
will be due and payable immediately. In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Senior Notes
because an Event of Default described in clause (4) under the definition of “—Events of Default” has
occurred and is continuing, the declaration of acceleration of the Senior Notes shall be automatically
annulled if the event of default or payment default triggering such Event of Default pursuant to clause
(4) shall be remedied or cured, or waived by the holders of the Indebtedness, or the Indebtedness that
gave rise to such Event of Default shall have been discharged in full, within 30 days after the declaration
of acceleration with respect thereto and if (1) the annulment of the acceleration of the Senior Notes
would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction and (2) all existing
Events of Default, except nonpayment of principal, premium or interest on the Senior Notes that became
due solely because of the acceleration of the Senior Notes, have been cured or waived.

373


-----

If an Event of Default described in clause (5) above occurs and is continuing, the principal of, premium,
if any, and accrued and unpaid interest on all the Senior Notes will become and be immediately due and
payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders. Holders of the
Senior Notes may not enforce the Senior Indenture or the Senior Notes except as provided in the Senior
Indenture and may not enforce the Security Documents except as provided in such Security Documents
and the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

Any notice of Default or Event of Default under the first paragraph of this section (other than an Event
of Default described in clause (5) above), notice of acceleration with respect to an Event of Default
under the first paragraph of this section (other than an Event of Default described in clause (5) above)
or instruction to the Trustee to provide a notice of Default or Event of Default under the first paragraph
of this section (other than an Event of Default described in clause (5) above), notice of acceleration with
respect to an Event of Default under the first paragraph of this section (other than an Event of Default
described in clause (5) above) or take any other action with respect to an alleged Default or Event of
Default the first paragraph of this section (other than an Event of Default described in clause (5) above)
(a “Noteholder Direction”) provided by any one or more Holders (each, a “Directing Holder”) must
be accompanied by a written representation from each such Holder to the Senior Notes Issuer and the
Trustee that such Holder is not, or, in the case such Holder is the Relevant Clearing System or the
Relevant Clearing System’s nominee, that such Holder is being instructed solely by beneficial owners
that are not, Net Short (a “Position Representation”), which representation, in the case of a Senior
Noteholder Direction relating to a notice of Default or Event of Default shall be deemed repeated at all
times until the resulting Event of Default is cured or otherwise ceases to exist or the Senior Notes are
accelerated. In addition, each Directing Holder must, at the time of providing a Senior Noteholder
Direction, covenant to provide the Senior Notes Issuer with such other information as the Senior Notes
Issuer may reasonably request from time to time in order to verify the accuracy of such Directing
Holder’s Position Representation within five Business Days of request thereof (a “Verification
**Covenant”). In any case in which the Holder is the Relevant Clearing System or the Relevant Clearing**
System’s nominee, any Position Representation or Verification Covenant required hereunder shall be
provided by the beneficial owner of the Senior Notes in lieu of the Relevant Clearing System or the
Relevant Clearing System’s nominee.

If, following the delivery of a Senior Noteholder Direction, but prior to acceleration of the Senior Notes,
the Senior Notes Issuer determines in good faith that there is a reasonable basis to believe a Directing
Holder was, at any relevant time, in breach of its Position Representation and the Senior Notes Issuer
provides to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate (which shall be provided to the Holders) certifying that
the Senior Notes Issuer (i) believes in good faith that there is a reasonable basis to believe a Directing
Holder was at any relevant time in breach of its Position Representation or its Verification Covenant
and (ii) has filed papers with a court of competent jurisdiction seeking a determination that such
Directing Holder was, at such time, in breach of its Position Representation, and seeking to invalidate
any Event of Default that resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction, the cure period with respect
to such Event of Default shall be automatically stayed pending a final and non-appealable determination
of a court of competent jurisdiction on such matter. If such Officer’s Certificate has been delivered to
the Trustee, the Trustee shall refrain from acting in accordance with such Noteholder Direction until
such time as the Senior Notes Issuer provides to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that (i) a
Directing Holder has satisfied its Verification Covenant, (ii) a Directing Holder has failed to satisfy its
Verification Covenant or (iii) a court of competent jurisdiction rules that such Directing Holder was, at
such time, not in breach of its Position Representation or its Verification Covenant, and during such
time the cure period with respect to any Event of Default that resulted from the applicable Noteholder
Direction shall be automatically stayed pending satisfaction of such Verification Covenant. Any breach
of the Position Representation shall result in such Directing Holder’s participation in such Noteholder
Direction being disregarded; and, if, without the participation of such Directing Holder, the percentage
of Senior Notes held by the remaining Holders that provided such Noteholder Direction would have
been insufficient to validly provide such Noteholder Direction, such Noteholder Direction shall be void
ab initio, with the effect that such Event of Default shall be deemed never to have occurred, and any

374


-----

related acceleration rescinded, and the Trustee shall be deemed not to have received such Noteholder
Direction or any notice of such alleged Default or Event of Default, shall not be permitted to act thereon
and shall be restricted from accepting and acting on any future Noteholder Direction in relation to such
Event of Default, unless such direction is given by Holders holding the requisite level of consent of
Holders required under the Senior Indenture to give such Noteholder Direction (excluding, for the
avoidance of doubt, any Directing Holder for so long as such Directing Holder is in breach of its Position
Representation). If the Directing Holder has satisfied its Verification Covenant, then the Trustee shall
be permitted to act in accordance with such Noteholder Direction. Notwithstanding the above, if such
Directing Holder’s participation is not required to achieve the requisite level of consent of Holders
required under the Senior Indenture to give such Noteholder Direction, the Trustee shall be permitted
to act in accordance with such Noteholder Direction notwithstanding any action taken or to be taken by
the Senior Notes Issuer (as described above). The Trustee shall be entitled to conclusively rely on any
Senior Noteholder Direction or Officer’s Certificate delivered to it in accordance with the Senior
Indenture without verification, investigation or otherwise as to the statements made therein.

Each Holder by accepting a Senior Note acknowledges and agrees that the Trustee (and any agent) shall
not be liable to any party howsoever arising for acting or refraining to act in accordance with (i) the
foregoing provisions, (ii) any Senior Noteholder Direction, (iii) any Officer’s Certificate or (iv) its
duties under the Senior Indenture, as the Trustee may determine in its sole discretion. The Trustee shall
have no obligation (i) to monitor, investigate, verify or otherwise determine if a Holder has Net Short
position, (ii) investigate the merits, validity, accuracy or authenticity of any Position Representation or
Officer’s Certificate, as the case may be, (iii) inquire if the Senior Notes Issuer will seek action to
determine if a Directing Holder has breached its Position Representation, (iv) enforce any Verification
Covenant, (v) monitor any court proceedings undertaken in connection therewith, (vi) monitor or
investigate whether any Default or Event of Default has been publicly reported or (vii) otherwise make
any calculations, investigations or determinations with respect to any Derivative Instruments, Net Short
position, Long Derivative Instrument, Short Derivative Instrument or otherwise. The Trustee shall be
entitled to rely on its rights, protections and benefits under the Senior Indenture at all times, including
without limitation for actions that are taken and subsequently stayed or annulled.

The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Senior Indenture by
notice to the Trustee may, on behalf of all Holders, waive all past or existing Defaults or Events of
Default (except with respect to nonpayment of principal, premium, interest or Additional Amounts, if
any) and rescind any such acceleration with respect to such Senior Notes and its consequences if
rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction.

Subject to the provisions of the Senior Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee, if an Event of
Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights
or powers under the Senior Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such
Holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity or security satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss,
liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal or interest when due, no
Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the Senior Indenture or the Senior Notes unless:

(1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee notice that an Event of Default is continuing and, if
such Event of Default is in respect of an Event of Default other than as described in clause (5) of
the first paragraph of this section, such Holder is not in breach of a Position Representation or
Verification Covenant;

(2) Holders, or in the case of any clauses (other than clause (5)) of the first paragraph of this section,
Directing Holders that are not in breach of a Position Representation or Verification Covenant, of
at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have requested the Trustee to pursue
the remedy;

(3) such Holder has offered the Trustee security or indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee against any
loss, liability or expense;

375


-----

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the request and
the offer of such security or indemnity; and

(5) the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not given the Trustee
a direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request within such 60-day
period.

Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes
are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy
available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Senior
Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee
will be required in the exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use
in the conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts
with law or the Senior Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any
other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the
Senior Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to indemnification or other security satisfactory to it in its
sole discretion against all losses, liabilities and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action.
The Trustee will have no obligation to monitor compliance by the Senior Notes Issuer with the Senior
Indenture. The Senior Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and the Trustee
is informed in writing of such occurrence by the Senior Notes Issuer, the Trustee must give notice of
the Default to the Holders within 60 days after being so notified by the Senior Notes Issuer. Except in
the case of a Default in the payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on any Senior Note,
the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as the Trustee determines that withholding notice is in
the interests of the Holders.

The Senior Notes Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal
year, an Officer’s Certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default or Event of
Default that occurred and is continuing during the previous year. The Senior Notes Issuer is required to
deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of any events of which
it is aware which would constitute a Default that has occurred and is continuing, their status and what
action the Senior Notes Issuer is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof.

The Senior Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default occurs for a failure to deliver a required certificate
in connection with another default (an “Initial Default”), then at the time such Initial Default is cured,
such Default for a failure to report or deliver a required certificate in connection with the Initial Default
will also be cured without any further action and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to
comply with the time periods prescribed in the covenant entitled “Certain Covenants—Reports” or
otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of the Senior Indenture
shall be deemed to be cured upon the delivery of any such report required by such covenant or notice
or certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in
the Senior Indenture.

The Senior Indenture will provide for the Trustee to take action on behalf of the Holders in certain
circumstances, but only if the Trustee is indemnified or secured to its satisfaction. It may not be possible
for the Trustee to take certain actions in relation to the Senior Notes and, accordingly, in such
circumstances the Trustee will be unable to take action, notwithstanding the provision of an indemnity
to it, and it will be for Holders to take action directly.

**Amendments and Waivers**

Subject to certain exceptions, the Senior Notes Documents may be amended, supplemented or otherwise
modified with the consent of Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Senior Notes then
outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange
offer for, Notes) and, subject to certain exceptions, any default or compliance with any provisions
thereof may be waived with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the

376


-----

Senior Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender
offer or exchange offer for, Notes); provided that, if any amendment, supplement, other modification
or waiver will only amend, supplement or waive one series of the Senior Notes, only the consent of a
majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes of such series shall be required.
However, without the consent of Holders holding not less than 90% of the then outstanding principal
amount of the Senior Notes affected, an amendment or waiver may not, with respect to any Senior Notes
held by a non-consenting Holder or, if any amendment, waiver or other modification will only amend,
supplement, modify or waive one series of the Senior Notes, without the consent of Holders holding
not less than 90% of the then outstanding aggregate principal amount of such series of Senior Notes
affected, with respect to any such series of Senior Notes held by a non-consenting Holder:

(1) reduce the principal amount of Senior Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment,
waiver or modification;

(2) reduce the stated rate of or extend the stated time for payment of interest on any Senior Note;

(3) reduce the principal of or extend the Stated Maturity of any Senior Note;

(4) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any Senior Note or change the time at which
any Senior Note may be redeemed, in each case, as described under “—Optional Redemption”;

(5) make any Senior Note payable in money other than that stated in the Senior Note;

(6) impair the contractual right of any Holder of any outstanding Note to bring suit for the
enforcement of any such payment on or with respect to such Holder’s Notes on or after the due
dates therefor;

(7) make any change in the provision of the Senior Indenture described under “—Withholding Taxes”
that adversely affects the right of any Holder of such Senior Notes in any material respect or
amends the terms of such Senior Notes in a way that would result in a loss of an exemption from
any of the Taxes described thereunder or an exemption from any obligation to withhold or deduct
Taxes so described thereunder unless the Senior Notes Issuer agrees to pay Additional Amounts,
if any, in respect thereof;

(8) release all or substantially all the security interests granted for the benefit of the Holders in the
Collateral other than in accordance with the terms of the Security Documents, the Intercreditor
Agreement, any applicable Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Senior Indenture;

(9) waive a Default or Event of Default with respect to the nonpayment of principal, premium or
interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on the Senior Notes (except pursuant to a rescission of
acceleration of the Senior Notes by the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount
of such Senior Notes and a waiver of the payment default that resulted from such acceleration);

(10) release all or substantially all the Guarantors from their obligations under the Note Guarantees or
the Senior Indenture, except in accordance with the terms of the Senior Indenture and the
Intercreditor Agreement; or

(11) make any change in the amendment or waiver provisions which require the Holders’ consent
described in this sentence.

For the avoidance of doubt, the Senior Indenture shall not include any provision incorporating, giving
effect to, or otherwise reflecting the provisions of Section 316(b) of the Trust Indenture Act.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any Holder, the Senior Notes Issuer, the Trustee,
the Security Agent and the other parties thereto, as applicable, may amend or supplement any Senior
Notes Documents:

(1) to cure any ambiguity, omission, defect, error or inconsistency;

377


-----

(2) to provide for the assumption by a successor Person of the obligations of the Senior Notes Issuer
or any Restricted Subsidiary under any Senior Notes Document;

(3) to add to the covenants or provide for a Note Guarantee for the benefit of the Holders or surrender
any right or power conferred upon the Senior Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(4) to make any change that would provide additional rights or benefits to the Trustee or the Holders
or that does not adversely affect the rights or benefits to the Trustee or any of the Holders in any
material respect under the Senior Notes Documents;

(5) to make such provisions as necessary (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or an
Officer of the Senior Notes Issuer) for the issuance of Additional Senior Notes;

(6) to provide for any Restricted Subsidiary to provide a Note Guarantee in accordance with the
covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” or “—Limitation
_on Additional Guarantees,” to add Note Guarantees with respect to the Senior Notes, to add_
security to or for the benefit of the Senior Notes, or to confirm and evidence the release,
termination, discharge or retaking of any Note Guarantee or Lien (including the Collateral and the
Security Documents) or any amendment in respect thereof with respect to or securing the Senior
Notes when such release, termination, discharge or retaking or amendment is provided for under
the Senior Indenture, the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement;

(7) to conform the text of the Senior Indenture, the Security Documents or the Senior Notes to any
provision of this “Description of the Senior Notes” to the extent that such provision in this
“Description of the Senior Notes” was intended to be a verbatim recitation of a provision of the
Senior Indenture, the Security Documents or the Senior Notes;

(8) to evidence and provide for the acceptance and appointment under the Senior Indenture or the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement of a successor trustee or
security agent pursuant to the requirements thereof or to provide for the accession by the Trustee
or Security Agent to any Senior Notes Document;

(9) in the case of the Security Documents, to mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or grant a security interest
in favor of the Security Agent for the benefit of the Holders, holders of the Senior Secured Notes
or parties to the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement, in any property which is required by
the Security Documents or the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement (as in effect on the
Issue Date or the Escrow Release Date) to be mortgaged, pledged or hypothecated, or in which a
security interest is required to be granted to the Security Agent, or to the extent necessary to grant
a Security Interest in the Collateral for the benefit of any Person; provided that the granting of
such security interest is not prohibited by the Senior Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the covenant described under “—Certain
_Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest” is complied with;_

(10) to comply with the rules of any applicable securities depositary;

(11) make any amendment to the provisions of the Senior Indenture relating to the transfer and
legending of Senior Notes as permitted by the Senior Indenture, including to facilitate the issuance
and administration of Senior Notes; provided that (i) compliance with the Senior Indenture as so
amended would not result in Senior Notes being transferred in violation of the Securities Act or
any other applicable securities law and (ii) such amendment does not adversely affect the rights
of Holders to transfer Notes in any material respect;

(12) to make any amendment of an administrative or ministerial nature to the provisions of the Senior
Indenture, the Senior Notes or the Security Documents to facilitate a Permitted Reorganization;
or

(13) as provided in “—Certain Covenants—Additional Intercreditor Agreements.”

378


-----

In formulating its decision on such matters, the Trustee shall be entitled to require and rely on such
evidence as it deems necessary, including Officer’s Certificates and Opinions of Counsel. The consent
of the Holders is not necessary under the Senior Indenture to approve the particular form of any
proposed amendment of any Senior Notes Document. It is sufficient if such consent approves the
substance of the proposed amendment. A consent to any amendment or waiver under the Senior
Indenture by any Holder of Senior Notes given in connection with a tender of such Holder’s Senior
Notes will not be rendered invalid by such tender.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the paragraphs above, in order to effect an amendment
authorized by clauses (3) or (6) above to add a Guarantor under the Senior Indenture, it shall only be
necessary for the supplemental indenture providing for the accession of such additional Guarantor to be
duly authorized and executed by (i) the Senior Notes Issuer, (ii) such additional Guarantor and (iii) the
Trustee. Any other amendments permitted by the Senior Indenture need only be duly authorized and
executed by the Senior Notes Issuer and the Trustee.

**Acts by Holders**

In determining whether the Holders of the required principal amount of the Senior Notes have concurred
in any direction, waiver or consent, the Senior Notes owned by the Senior Notes Issuer or by any Person
directly or indirectly controlling, or controlled by, or under direct or indirect common control with, the
Senior Notes Issuer will be disregarded and deemed not to be outstanding; provided that, for the purpose
of determining whether the Trustee shall be protected in relying on any such direction, waiver or
consent, only Notes which the Trustee knows are so owned shall be so disregarded.

**Defeasance**

The Senior Notes Issuer at any time may terminate all obligations of the Senior Notes Issuer and each
Guarantor under the Senior Notes and the Senior Indenture (“legal defeasance”) and cure all then
existing Defaults and Events of Default, except for certain obligations, including those respecting the
defeasance trust, the rights, powers, trusts, duties, immunities and indemnities of the Trustee and the
obligations of the Senior Notes Issuer in connection therewith and obligations concerning issuing
temporary Notes, registration of Senior Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes and the
maintenance of an office or agency for payment and money for security payments held in trust. Subject
to the foregoing, if the Senior Notes Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, the Security Documents
and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement in effect at such time will terminate (other than with respect to the defeasance
trust).

The Senior Notes Issuer at any time may terminate its and the Restricted Subsidiaries’ obligations under
the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants” (other than clauses (1) and (2) under “—Merger
_and Consolidation—The Senior Notes Issuer”) and “—Change of Control,” and the default provisions_
relating to such covenants described under “—Events of Default” above, the operation of the crossdefault upon a payment default, the cross-acceleration provision, the bankruptcy provisions, the
judgment default provision, the guarantee provision and the security default provision described under
“—Events of Default” (“covenant defeasance”).

The Senior Notes Issuer at its option at any time may exercise its legal defeasance option
notwithstanding its prior exercise of its covenant defeasance option. If the Senior Notes Issuer exercises
its legal defeasance option, payment of the Senior Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of
Default with respect to such Senior Notes. If the Senior Notes Issuer exercises its covenant defeasance
option with respect to the Senior Notes, payment of the Senior Notes may not be accelerated because
of an Event of Default specified in clause (3) (other than with respect to clauses (1) and (2) of the
covenant described under “—Merger and Consolidation—The Senior Notes Issuer”), (4), (5) (with
respect only to the Significant Subsidiaries), (6), (7) or (8) under “—Events of Default.”

379


-----

In order to exercise either defeasance option, the Senior Notes Issuer must irrevocably deposit in trust
(the “defeasance trust”) with the Trustee (or another entity designated or appointed (as agent) by the
Trustee for this purpose) money or U.S. dollar-denominated U.S. Government Obligations or a
combination thereof sufficient for the payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest on the Senior
Notes to redemption or maturity, as the case may be; provided that, if requested by the Senior Notes
Issuer, the Trustee or the Paying Agent (on its behalf) will distribute any amounts deposited with it to
the Holders prior to the Stated Maturity or redemption date, as the case may be, and must comply with
certain other conditions, including delivery to the Trustee of:

(1) an Opinion of Counsel in the United States to the effect that Holders of the relevant Notes will not
recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such deposit and
defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amount and in the same
manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such deposit and defeasance had not
occurred (and in the case of legal defeasance only, such Opinion of Counsel in the United States
must be based on a ruling received by the Senior Notes Issuer from, or published by, the U.S.
Internal Revenue Service or change in applicable U.S. federal income tax law);

(2) an Officer’s Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Senior Notes Issuer with the
intent of defeating, hindering, delaying, defrauding or preferring any creditors of the Senior Notes
Issuer;

(3) an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent
provided for or relating to legal defeasance or covenant defeasance, as the case may be, have been
complied with; and

(4) all other documents or other information that the Trustee may reasonably require in connection
with either defeasance option.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Senior Indenture, and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the Intercreditor Agreement
and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents will be discharged and cease
to be of further effect (except as to surviving rights of conversion or transfer or exchange of the Senior
Notes, as expressly provided for in the Senior Indenture, or as to any other provision of the Senior
Indenture, which, pursuant to its terms, expressly survives such discharge) as to all outstanding Notes
when (1) either (a) all the Senior Notes previously authenticated and delivered (other than certain lost,
stolen or destroyed Notes, and certain Notes for which provision for payment was previously made and
thereafter the funds have been released to the Senior Notes Issuer) have been delivered to the Paying
Agent for cancellation; or (b) all Senior Notes not previously delivered to the Paying Agent for
cancellation (i) have become due and payable, (ii) will become due and payable at their Stated Maturity
within one year or (iii) are to be called for redemption within one year under arrangements reasonably
satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the Paying Agent in the name, and
at the expense, of the Senior Notes Issuer; (2) the Senior Notes Issuer has deposited or caused to be
deposited with the Trustee (or another entity designated or appointed (as agent) by the Trustee for this
purpose), money or dollar-denominated U.S. Government Securities, or a combination thereof, as
applicable in an amount sufficient to pay and discharge the entire Indebtedness on the Senior Notes not
previously delivered to the Paying Agent for cancellation, for principal, premium, if any, and interest
to the date of deposit (in the case of Senior Notes that have become due and payable), or to the Stated
Maturity or redemption date, as the case may be; (3) the Senior Notes Issuer has paid or caused to be
paid all other sums payable under the Senior Indenture; (4) the Senior Notes Issuer has delivered
irrevocable instructions to the Trustee under the Senior Indenture to apply the deposited money toward
the payment of the Senior Notes at maturity or on the redemption date, as the case may be, provided
that, if requested by the Senior Notes Issuer, the Trustee or the Paying Agent (on its behalf) may
distribute any amounts deposited with it to the Holders prior to the maturity or the redemption date, as
the case may be, and (5) the Senior Notes Issuer has delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate

380


-----

and an Opinion of Counsel (provided that such counsel may not be an employee of the Company or its
Subsidiaries) each to the effect that the conditions precedent to the satisfaction and discharge of the
Senior Indenture described in this section have been complied with; provided that any such counsel
may rely on any Officer’s Certificate as to matters of fact (including as to compliance with the foregoing
clauses (1), (2) and (3)).

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Shareholders**

No director, officer, employee, incorporator or shareholder of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or Affiliates, as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of the Senior Notes Issuer or any
Guarantor under the Senior Notes Documents or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of,
such obligations or their creation. Each Holder by accepting a Senior Note waives and releases all such
liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Senior Notes. Such
waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the U.S. federal securities laws and it is the view
of the SEC that such a waiver is against public policy.

**Concerning the Trustee and Certain Agents**

Ankura Trust Company, LLC will be appointed as Trustee under the Senior Indenture. The Senior
Indenture will provide that, except during the continuance of an Event of Default, the Trustee will
perform only such duties as are set forth specifically in the Senior Indenture. During the existence of an
Event of Default, the Trustee will exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it under the Senior
Indenture and use the same degree of care that a prudent Person would use in conducting its own affairs.
The permissive rights of the Trustee to take or refrain from taking any action enumerated in the Senior
Indenture will not be construed as an obligation or duty.

The Senior Indenture will impose certain limitations on the rights of the Trustee, should it become a
creditor of the Senior Notes Issuer, to obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to realize on certain
property received in respect of any such claim as security or otherwise. The Trustee or any Agent will
be permitted to engage in other transactions with the Company and its Affiliates and Subsidiaries.

The Senior Indenture will set out the terms under which the Trustee may retire or be removed and
replaced. Such terms will include, among others, (1) that the Trustee may be removed at any time by
the Holders of a majority in principal amount of then outstanding Notes, or may resign at any time by
giving written notice to the Senior Notes Issuer, and that if the Trustee at any time (a) has or acquires
actual knowledge of a conflict of interest while a Default is continuing that is not eliminated, or
(b) becomes incapable of acting as Trustee or becomes insolvent or bankrupt, then the Senior Notes
Issuer may remove the Trustee, or any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder for not less than six
months may petition any court for removal of the Trustee and appointment of a successor Trustee. Any
removal or resignation of the Trustee shall not become effective until the acceptance of appointment by
the successor Trustee.

The Senior Indenture will contain provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee for any loss, liability,
Taxes or expenses Incurred without gross negligence, willful misconduct or fraud on its part, arising
out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of the Senior Indenture and any other
Notes Document.

The Trustee will also act in certain roles, including as security agent, in respect of obligations under the
Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement, and Trustee in respect of the
Senior Secured Notes. See also “Related Party Transactions—Ankura Trust Company.”

381


-----

**Notices**

Notices, warnings, summonses and other communications to the holders of the Senior Notes from the
Trustee shall be sent via the Relevant Clearing System (as applicable) with a copy to the Senior Notes
Issuer. Any such notice or communication shall be deemed to be given or made when sent from the
Relevant Clearing System (as applicable). The Senior Notes Issuer’s written notifications to the holders
of Senior Notes shall be sent through the Relevant Clearing System (as applicable) with a copy to the
Trustee. In addition, for so long as any of the Senior Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange
and if and for so long as the rules of Authority shall so require, the Senior Notes Issuer will notify the
Authority of any notice with respect to the Senior Notes.

**Prescription**

Claims against the Senior Notes Issuer and the Guarantors for the payment of principal, or premium, if
any, on the Senior Notes will be prescribed 10 years after the applicable due date for payment thereof.
Claims against the Senior Notes Issuer and the Guarantors for the payment of interest on the Senior
Notes will be prescribed six years after the applicable due date for payment of interest.

**Currency Indemnity and Calculation of Pound Sterling-Denominated Restrictions**

The sole currency of account and payment for all sums payable by the Senior Notes Issuer is U.S.
dollars. Any amount received or recovered in a currency other than U.S. dollars (whether as a result of,
or the enforcement of, a judgment or order of a court of any jurisdiction, in the winding-up or dissolution
of the Company, any Subsidiary or otherwise) by a Holder in respect of any sum expressed to be due to
it from the Senior Notes Issuer will constitute a discharge of the Senior Notes Issuer only to the extent
of the U.S. dollar amount, as the case may be, which the recipient is able to purchase with the amount
so received or recovered in that other currency on the date of that receipt or recovery (or, if it is not
possible to make that purchase on that date, on the first date on which it is possible to do so). If that
U.S. dollar amount is less than the U.S. dollar amount expressed to be due to the recipient under the
Senior Indenture or any Senior Note, the Senior Notes Issuer will indemnify the recipient against any
loss sustained by it as a result. In any event, the Senior Notes Issuer will indemnify the recipient against
the cost of making any such purchase.

Except as otherwise specifically set forth herein, for purposes of determining compliance with any U.S.
dollar-denominated restriction herein, the Dollar Equivalent for purposes hereof that is denominated in
a currency other than U.S. dollars shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in
effect on the date such non-U.S. dollar amount is Incurred or made, as the case may be.

**Enforceability of Judgments**

Since substantially all the assets of the Senior Notes Issuer and the Guarantors are located outside the
United States, any judgment obtained in the United States against the Senior Notes Issuer or the
Guarantors, including judgments with respect to the payment of principal, premium, interest, Additional
Amounts, if any, and any redemption price and any purchase price with respect to the Senior Notes,
may not be collectable within the United States. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the
_Note Guarantees and the Collateral—Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws, capital maintenance_
_and other limitations on the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral may adversely affect the validity and_
_enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral” and “Certain Insolvency Law_
_Considerations”._

**Consent to Jurisdiction and Service**

In relation to any legal action or proceedings arising out of or in connection with the Senior Indenture
and the Senior Notes, the Senior Notes Issuer and the Guarantors will in the Senior Indenture

382


-----

irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of the federal and state courts in the Borough of Manhattan in the
City of New York, County and State of New York, United States.

**Governing Law**

The Senior Indenture, the Senior Notes, the Senior Escrow Agreement, the Senior Escrow Charge and
the rights and duties of the parties thereunder, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with
the laws of the State of New York. The Intercreditor Agreement and the Proceeds Loan will be governed
by the law of England and Wales, and the Security Documents will be governed by the laws of England
and Wales and Jersey.

**Certain Definitions**

“Acquired Indebtedness” means Indebtedness (1) of a Person or any of its Subsidiaries existing at the
time such Person becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, or (2) assumed in connection with the acquisition
of assets from such Person, in each case whether or not Incurred by such Person in connection with
such Person becoming a Restricted Subsidiary or such acquisition or (3) of a Person at the time such
Person merges with or into or consolidates or otherwise combines with the Senior Notes Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary. Acquired Indebtedness shall be deemed to have been Incurred, with respect to
clause (1) of the preceding sentence, on the date such Person becomes a Restricted Subsidiary and, with
respect to clause (2) of the preceding sentence, on the date of consummation of such acquisition of
assets and, with respect to clause (3) of the preceding sentence, on the date of the relevant merger,
consolidation or other combination.

“Advanced Commission Obligations” means any amounts owed or deemed to be owed in respect of
advances of commissions given to the Senior Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary by insurance
providers pursuant to agreements with such providers as a result of or upon the termination of such
agreements.

commencement of the period for which the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio is being calculated and
on or prior to the date on which the event for which the calculation of the Consolidated Net Leverage
Ratio is made (the “Calculation Date”), then the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio will be calculated
giving pro forma effect (as determined by a responsible accounting or financial officer of the Company),
including in respect of anticipated cost savings, expense reductions and cost synergies reasonably

Restricted Subsidiary at all times during such reference period;

(5) any Person that is not a Restricted Subsidiary on the Calculation Date will be deemed not to have
been a Restricted Subsidiary at any time during such reference period;

be calculated as if the rate in effect on the Calculation Date had been the applicable rate for the
entire period (taking into account any Interest Rate Agreement applicable to such Indebtedness),
and if any Indebtedness is not denominated in the Company’s functional currency, that
Indebtedness for purposes of the calculation of Consolidated Net Leverage shall be treated in
accordance with IFRS; and

**BOOK-ENTRY, DELIVERY AND FORM**

**General**

The Notes sold outside the United States to non-U.S. persons pursuant to Regulation S under the U.S.
Securities Act will initially be represented by a global note in registered form without interest coupons
attached (the “Regulation S Global Note”). On the Issue Date, the Regulation S Global Notes
representing the Dollar Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Notes (the “USD Regulation S Global
**Note”) will be deposited with a custodian of DTC and registered in the name of Cede & Co., as nominee**
of DTC. On the Issue Date, the Regulation S Global Notes representing the Euro Senior Secured Notes
(the “EUR Regulation S Global Note”) will be deposited upon issuance with a common depositary
and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and
Clearstream.

The Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers, pursuant to Rule 144A, will
initially be represented by a global note in registered form without interest coupons attached (the “144A
**Global Note”). On the Issue Date, the 144A Global Notes representing the Dollar Senior Secured Notes**
and the Senior Notes (the “USD 144A Note”) will be deposited with a custodian of DTC and registered
in the name of Cede & Co., as nominee of DTC. On the Issue Date, the 144A Global Notes representing
the Euro Senior Secured Notes (the “EUR 144A Global Note”) will be deposited upon issuance with a
common depositary and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the
accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream. The Regulation S Global Notes and the 144A Global Notes are
collectively referred to herein as the “Global Notes”).

Ownership of interests in the 144A Global Notes (the “144A Book-Entry Interests”) and ownership
of interests in the Regulation S Global Notes (the “Regulation S Book-Entry Interests” and, together
with 144A Book-Entry Interests, the “Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons that have
accounts with DTC, in the case of the Global Notes representing the Dollar Senior Secured Notes and
the Senior Notes (the “USD Global Notes”), and Euroclear and/or Clearstream, in the case of the Global
Notes representing the Euro Senior Secured Notes (the “EUR Global Notes”), or persons that may hold
interests through such participants. Book-Entry Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be
effected only through, records maintained in book-entry form by DTC or Euroclear and/or Clearstream
and their participants. The Book-Entry Interests in USD Global Notes will be issued only in
denominations of $200,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. The Book-Entry Interests
in EUR Global Notes will be issued only in denominations of €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000
in excess thereof.

The Book-Entry Interests will not be held in definitive form. Instead, DTC or Euroclear and/or
Clearstream, as applicable, will credit on their respective book-entry registration and transfer systems
a participant’s account with the interest beneficially owned by such participant. The laws of some
jurisdictions, including certain states of the United States, may require that certain purchasers of
securities take physical delivery of such securities in definitive form. The foregoing limitations may
impair the ability to own, transfer or pledge Book-Entry Interests. In addition, while the Notes are in
global form, owners of interests in the Global Notes will not have the Notes registered in their names,
will not receive physical delivery of the Notes in certificated form and will not be considered the
registered owners or “holders” of Notes under the Indenture for any purpose.

So long as the Notes are held in global form, the custodian for DTC or the common depositary for
Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable (or its respective nominee), will be considered the sole
Holder of Global Notes for all purposes under the Indenture. As such, participants must rely on the
procedures of the DTC or Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, and indirect participants must
rely on the procedures of DTC or Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, and the participants
through which they own Book-Entry Interests in order to exercise any rights of holders under the
Indenture.

426


-----

None of the Company, any future Guarantor, the Trustee, any Paying Agent, the Registrar or the
Transfer Agent under the Indenture, nor any of the Issuer’s agents will have any responsibility or be
liable for any aspect of the records relating to the Book-Entry Interests.

**Issuance of Definitive Registered Notes**

Under the terms of the Indenture, owners of Book-Entry Interests will receive definitive Notes in
registered form (the “Definitive Registered Notes”) only in the following circumstances:

- if DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream notifies the Issuer that it is unwilling or unable to continue to
act as depository and a successor depository is not appointed by the Issuer within 120 days;

- in whole, but not in part, if DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream so requests following an event of
default under the Indenture, as applicable; or

- if the owner of a Book-Entry Interest requests such exchange in writing delivered through DTC,
Euroclear or Clearstream following an event of default under the Indenture.

In such an event, the Registrar will issue Definitive Registered Notes, registered in the name or names
and issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of DTC or Euroclear and/or
Clearstream, as applicable (in accordance with their respective customary procedures and based upon
directions received from participants reflecting the beneficial ownership of the Book-Entry Interests),
and such Definitive Registered Notes will bear the restrictive legend as provided in the Indenture, unless
that legend is not required by the Indenture, or applicable law.

To the extent permitted by law, the Issuer, the Trustee, any Paying Agent and the Registrar shall be
entitled to treat the registered holder of any Global Note as the absolute owner thereof and no person
will be liable for treating the registered holder as such. Ownership of the Global Notes will be evidenced
through registration in the register maintained by the Registrar, and such registration is a means of
evidencing title to the Notes.

The Issuer will not impose any fees or other charges in respect of the Notes; however, owners of the
Book-Entry Interests may incur fees normally payable in respect of the maintenance and operation of
accounts in DTC or Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable.

**Redemption of the Global Notes**

In the event any Global Note, or any portion thereof, is redeemed, DTC or Euroclear and/or Clearstream,
as applicable, will distribute the amount received by it in respect of the Global Note so redeemed to the
owners of the Book-Entry Interests in such Global Note from the amount received by it in respect of
the redemption of such Global Note. The redemption price payable in connection with the redemption
of such Book-Entry Interests will be equal to the amount received by DTC or Euroclear and/or
Clearstream, as applicable, in connection with the redemption of such Global Note (or any portion
thereof). The Issuer understands that under existing practices of DTC or Euroclear and/or Clearstream,
if fewer than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, DTC or Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as
applicable, will credit its respective participants’ accounts on a proportionate basis (with adjustments
to prevent fractions) or by lot or on such other basis as it deems fair and appropriate; provided, however,
that no Book-Entry Interest of less than $200,000 principal amount (in the case of the USD Global
Notes) and €100,000 principal amount (in the case of the EUR Global Notes) at maturity, or less, may
be redeemed in part.

**Payments on the Global Notes**

Payments of any amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes (including principal, premium, interest,
additional interest and additional amounts) will be made by the Issuer to the relevant Paying Agent. The

427


-----

relevant Paying Agent will, in turn, make such payments to DTC or Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as
applicable, or their respective nominees (in the case of the Global Notes), which will distribute such
payments to participants in accordance with their respective procedures.

Under the terms of the Indenture, the Issuer and the Trustee will treat the registered holder of the Global
Notes (i.e., DTC or Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable (or their respective nominees)) as the
owner thereof for the purpose of receiving payments and for all other purposes. Consequently, neither
the Issuer, the Trustee nor any of their respective agents has or will have any responsibility or liability
for:

- any aspects of the records of DTC or Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, or any
participant or indirect participant relating to, or payments made on account of, a Book-Entry
Interest, for any such payments made by DTC or Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable
or any participant or indirect participant, or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing the
records of DTC or Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, or any participant or indirect
participant relating to, or payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest;

- payments made by DTC or Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, or any participant or
indirect participant, or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing the records of DTC or
Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, or any participant or indirect participant relating
to or payments made on account of a Book-Entry Interest; or

- DTC or Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, or any participant or indirect participant.

Payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through participants are the
responsibility of such participants, as is now the case with securities held for the accounts of customers
registered in “street name.”

Payments will be subject in all cases to any fiscal or other laws and regulations (including any
regulations of the applicable clearing system) applicable thereto. None of the Company, any future
Guarantor, the Trustee, any Paying Agent, the Registrar or the Transfer Agent, nor any of the Issuer’s
agents will be liable to any holder of a Global Note or any other person for any commissions, costs,
losses or expenses in relation to or resulting from any currency conversion or rounding effected in
connection with any such payment. Holders may be subject to foreign exchange risks that may have
economic and tax consequences to them.

**Currency and Payment for the Global Notes**

The principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of, the USD
Global Notes will be paid to holders of interest in such Notes (the “DTC Holders”) through DTC in
U.S. dollars. The principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect
of, the EUR Global Notes will be paid to the holders of interest in such Notes (the
“Euroclear/Clearstream Holders”) through Euroclear and/or Clearstream in euro.

**Action by Owners of Book-Entry Interests**

DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream have advised the Issuer that they will take any action permitted to be
taken by a holder of Notes only at the direction of one or more participants to whose account the BookEntry Interests in the Global Notes, respectively, are credited and only in respect of such portion of the
aggregate principal amount of Notes, respectively, as to which such participant or participants has or
have given such direction. DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream will not exercise any discretion in the
granting of consents, waivers or the taking of any other action in respect of the Global Notes. However,
if there is an event of default under the Indenture, each of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream reserves the
right to exchange the Global Notes for Definitive Registered Notes in certificated form, and to distribute
such Definitive Registered Notes to its respective participants.

428


-----

**Transfers**

Transfers between participants in DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable, will be done in
accordance with DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream rules and will be settled in immediately available
funds. If a holder requires physical delivery of Definitive Registered Notes for any reason, including to
sell the Notes to persons in states which require physical delivery of such securities or to pledge such
securities, such holder must transfer its interest in the Global Notes in accordance with the normal
procedures of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream and in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture.

The Global Notes will bear a legend to the effect set forth in “Notice to Investors.” “Book-Entry Interests
_in the Global Notes,” respectively, will be subject to the restrictions on transfer discussed in “Notice to_
_Investors.”_

The 144A Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of
Regulation S Book-Entry Interests denominated in the same currency only upon delivery by the
transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture, as applicable) to the effect
that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S of the Securities Act. Through and
including the 40th day after the later of the commencement of the offering of the Notes and the closing
of the Offering (the “distribution compliance period”), Regulation S Book-Entry Interests will be
limited to persons that have accounts with DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream or persons who hold interests
through DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream, and any sale or transfer of such interest to U.S. persons shall
not be permitted during such period unless such resale or transfer is made pursuant to Rule 144A under
the U.S. Securities Act. Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes
delivery in the form of 144A Book-Entry Interests, respectively, only upon delivery by the transferor
of a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being
made to a person who the transferor reasonably believes is a “qualified institutional buyer” within the
meaning of Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule
144A under the U.S. Securities Act or otherwise in accordance with the transfer restrictions described
under “Notice to Investors” and in accordance with any applicable securities laws of any other
jurisdiction.

Subject to the foregoing, and as set forth in “Notice to Investors,” Book-Entry Interests may be
transferred and exchanged as described under “Description of the Notes—Transfer and Exchange.” Any
Book-Entry Interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the
form of a Book-Entry Interest in the other Global Note of the same denomination will, upon transfer,
cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the first-mentioned Global Note and become a Book-Entry Interest
in the other Global Note, and accordingly, will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if any,
and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in such other Global Note for as long as it
retains such a Book-Entry Interest.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests in a Global
Note only as described under “Description of the Notes—Transfer and Exchange” and, if required, only
if the transferor first delivers to the Trustee a written certificate (in the form provided in the Indenture)
to the effect that such transfer will comply with the appropriate transfer restrictions applicable to such
Notes. See “Notice to Investors.”

Transfers involving an exchange of a Regulation S Book-Entry Interest for 144A Book-Entry Interest
will be done by DTC by means of an instruction originating from the Trustee through the DTC
Deposit/Withdrawal Custodian system. Accordingly, in connection with any such transfer, appropriate
adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in the principal amount of the relevant Regulation S
Global Note and a corresponding increase in the principal amount of the corresponding 144A Global
Note. The policies or practices of DTC may prohibit transfer of unrestricted Book-Entry Interests in the
Regulation S Global Note prior to the expiration of the 40 days after the date of initial issuance of the
notes.

429


-----

**Information Concerning DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream**

All Book-Entry Interests will be subject to the operations and procedures of DTC, Euroclear and
Clearstream, as applicable. The Issuer provides the following summaries of those operations and
procedures solely for the convenience of investors. The operations and procedures of each settlement
system are controlled by that settlement system and may be changed at any time. None of the Issuer,
the initial purchasers or the Trustee are responsible for those operations or procedures.

DTC advised the Issuer that it is a limited-purpose trust company organized under the New York
Banking Law, a “banking organization” under the New York Banking Law, a member of the Federal
Reserve System, a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial
Code, and a “clearing agency” registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the U.S.
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). DTC holds and provides asset
servicing for issues of U.S. and non-U.S. equity issues, corporate and municipal debt issues, and money
market instruments (that DTC’s direct participants deposit with DTC). DTC also facilitates the posttrade settlement among direct participants of sales and other securities transactions in deposited
securities, through electronic computerized book-entry transfers and pledges between direct
participants’ accounts. DTC is a wholly owned subsidiary of The Depository Trust & Clearing
Corporation (“DTCC”). DTCC is the holding company for DTC, National Securities Clearing
Corporation and Fixed Income Clearing Corporation, all of which are registered clearing agencies.
DTCC is owned by the users of its regulated subsidiaries. Access to the DTC system is also available
to others such as both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, and
clearing corporations that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a direct participant,
either directly or indirectly.

Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for participating organizations and also facilitate the
clearance and settlement of securities transactions between their respective participants through
electronic book-entry changes in the accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide
various services to their participants, including the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement,
lending and borrowing of internationally traded securities. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with
domestic securities markets. Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial institutions, such as
underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other organizations.
Indirect access to Euroclear and Clearstream is also available to others, such as banks, brokers, dealers
and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear and
Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly.

Because DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on
behalf of indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge
such interest to persons or entities that do not participate in DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream systems, or
otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definite certificate for
that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of
securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such person may
be limited. In addition, owners of beneficial interests through DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream systems
will receive distributions attributable to the 144A Global Notes only through DTC, Euroclear or
Clearstream participants.

**Initial Settlement**

Initial settlement for the USD Global Notes will be made in U.S. dollars and initial settlement for the
EUR Global Notes will be made in euro. Book-Entry Interests owned through DTC, Euroclear or
Clearstream accounts will follow the settlement procedures applicable to conventional Eurobonds in
registered form. Book-Entry Interests will be credited to the securities custody accounts of DTC Holders
and Euroclear/Clearstream Holders on the business day following the settlement date against payment
for value on the settlement date.

430


-----

**Secondary Market Trading**

The Book-Entry Interests will trade through participants of DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream and will
settle in same-day funds. Since the purchase determines the place of delivery, it is important to establish
at the time of trading of any Book-Entry Interests where both the purchaser’s and the seller’s accounts
are located to ensure that settlement can be made on the desired value date.

While the USD Global Notes may only be traded in denominations of $200,000 and multiples of $1,000
and the Euro Global Notes may only be traded in denominations of €100,000 and multiples of €1,000,
for the purpose of Euroclear and Clearstream, the denominations are considered as $1,000 and €1,000,
respectively. For the avoidance of doubt, Euroclear and Clearstream are not required to monitor or
enforce the minimum denomination or the tradeable amount. See “Notice to Investors” for the transfer
restrictions.

**Special Timing Considerations**

You should be aware that investors will only be able to make and receive deliveries, payments and other
communications involving the Notes through DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream on days when that system
is open for business.

431

**CERTAIN ERISA CONSIDERATIONS**

The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”) and the Internal
Revenue Code (the “Code”) impose certain restrictions on (a) employee benefit plans (as defined in
Section 3(3) of ERISA) that are subject to Title I of ERISA, (b) plans, including individual retirement
accounts and other arrangements that are subject to Section 4975 of the Code or provisions under any
other federal, state, local, non-US, or other laws, rules, regulations that are substantially similar to such
provisions of ERISA or the Code (collectively, “Similar Laws”) and (c) entities whose underlying
assets are considered to include “plan assets” (within the meaning of 29 C.F.R. Section 2510.3-101 (as
modified by Section 3(42) of ERISA)) or any applicable Similar Law (“Plan Assets”) of any such plans
described in (a) or (b) above (each, a “Plan”).

**_General Fiduciary Matters_**

ERISA and the Code impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries of Plans subject to Title I of
ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code (“ERISA Plans”) and prohibit certain transactions between a
Plan and fiduciaries or other interested parties. Under ERISA and the Code, any person who exercises
any discretionary authority or control over the administration of an ERISA Plan or the management or
disposition of the assets of an ERISA Plan, or who renders investment advice for a fee or other
compensation (direct or indirect) to an ERISA Plan, is generally considered to be a fiduciary of such
ERISA Plan. In considering an investment of a portion of the assets of any Plan in the Notes, a fiduciary
(taking into account the facts and circumstances of the Plan) should determine whether the investment
is in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the Plan and the applicable provisions
of ERISA, the Code or any Similar Law relating to a fiduciary’s duties to the Plan including, without
limitation, the prudence, diversification, delegation of control and prohibited transaction provisions of
ERISA, the Code and any other applicable Similar Law.

Each ERISA Plan should consider the fact that neither the Issuer, Security Agent, the initial purchasers
or any of their respective affiliates (the “Transaction Parties”) is acting, or will act, as a fiduciary to
any ERISA Plan with respect to the decision to purchase or hold the notes. The Transaction Parties are
not undertaking to provide impartial investment advice or advice based on any particular investment
need, or to give advice in a fiduciary capacity, with respect to the decision to purchase or hold the notes.
All communications, correspondence and materials from the Transaction Parties with respect to the
notes are intended to be general in nature and are not directed at any specific purchaser of the notes,
and do not constitute advice regarding the advisability of investment in the notes for any specific
purchaser. The decision to purchase and hold the notes must be made solely by each prospective ERISA
Plan purchaser on an arm’s length basis.

**_Prohibited Transaction Issues_**

Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit ERISA Plans from engaging in specified
transactions involving Plan Assets with persons or entities who are “parties in interest,” within the
meaning of Section 3(14) of ERISA, or “disqualified persons,” within the meaning of Section 4975 of
the Code, unless an exemption is available. A party in interest or disqualified person who engages in a
prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA
and the Code. Plans that are “governmental plans” (as defined in Section 3(32) of ERISA or Section
4975(g)(2)) of the Code, certain “church plans” (as defined in Section 3(33) of ERISA or Section
4975(g)(3) of the Code) and non-US plans (as described in Section 4(b)(4) of ERISA) are not subject
to the requirements of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code but may be subject to similar prohibitions
under the applicable Similar Laws.

The acquisition and/or holding of Notes by an ERISA Plan with respect to which any of the Transaction
Parties is considered a party in interest or disqualified person may constitute or result in a direct or
indirect prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code, unless the

432


-----

investment is acquired and is held in accordance with an applicable statutory, class or individual
prohibited transaction exemption. In this regard, the US Department of Labor has issued prohibited
transaction class exemptions (“PTCEs”) that may apply to provide exemptive relief for direct or
indirect prohibited transactions resulting from the acquisition and holding of the Notes. These class
exemptions include, without limitation, PTCE 84-14, as amended, respecting transactions determined
by an independent qualified professional asset manager; PTCE 90-1, respecting insurance company
pooled separate accounts; PTCE 91-38, respecting bank-maintained collective investment funds; PTCE
95-60, respecting life insurance company general accounts; and PTCE 96-23, respecting transactions
determined by in-house asset managers. In addition, Section 408(b)(17) of **ERISA and Section**
4975(d)(20) of the Code provide relief from the prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and Section
4975 of the Code for certain transactions between an ERISA Plan and a person that is a party in interest
or disqualified person solely by reason of providing services to the ERISA Plan or a relationship with
such service provider, provided that neither the person transacting with the ERISA Plan nor an affiliate
exercises any discretionary authority or control with respect to the assets of the ERISA Plan involved
in the transaction or renders investment advice with respect to such assets, and provided further that the
ERISA Plan pays no more than and receives no less than adequate consideration in connection with the
transaction. There can be no assurance that all of the conditions of any such exemptions will be satisfied.

In addition, a fiduciary of an ERISA Plan that engages in a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be
subject to penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. Accordingly, each original or subsequent
purchaser or transferee of a Note that is or may become a Plan is responsible for determining that its
purchase and holding of such Note will not constitute a non-exempt prohibited transaction under ERISA
or Section 4975 of the Code or similar violation of any applicable Similar Laws. See “Notice to
_Investors.”_

**_Representation_**

By acceptance of a Note, each purchaser and subsequent transferee will be deemed to have represented
and warranted that (A) either (1) no portion of the assets used by such purchaser or transferee to acquire
and hold the Notes constitutes Plan Assets or (2) the purchase and holding of the Notes by such
purchaser or transferee will not constitute or result in (a) a non-exempt prohibited transaction under
Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or a similar violation under any applicable Similar
Laws and (b) none of the Transaction Parties have been relied upon for any advice with respect to the
purchaser or transferee’s decision to acquire and hold the notes, and none of them shall at any time be
relied upon as a fiduciary with respect to any decision to acquire, continue to hold or transfer the notes
and (B) it will not sell or otherwise transfer such notes or any interest therein otherwise than to a
purchaser or transferee that is deemed to make these same representations, warranties and agreements
with respect to its purchase and holding of such note or any interest therein.

THE PRECEDING DISCUSSION IS ONLY A SUMMARY OF CERTAIN ERISA IMPLICATIONS
OF AN INVESTMENT IN THE NOTES AND DOES NOT PURPORT TO BE COMPLETE.
PROSPECTIVE INVESTORS SHOULD CONSULT WITH THEIR OWN LEGAL, TAX,
FINANCIAL AND OTHER ADVISORS PRIOR TO INVESTING IN THE NOTES TO REVIEW
THESE IMPLICATIONS IN LIGHT OF SUCH INVESTOR’S PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES.

THE OFFERING OF THE NOTES SHALL NOT BE CONSTRUED AS A REPRESENTATION BY
THE ISSUER THAT AN INVESTMENT IN THE NOTES WOULD MEET ANY OR ALL OF THE
RELEVANT LEGAL REQUIREMENTS WITH RESPECT TO INVESTMENTS BY, OR IS
APPROPRIATE FOR, ANY PLAN. PURCHASERS OF THE NOTES HAVE THE EXCLUSIVE
RESPONSIBILITY FOR ENSURING THAT THEIR PURCHASE AND HOLDING OF THE NOTES
COMPLIES WITH THE FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITY RULES OF ERISA AND DOES NOT
VIOLATE THE PROHIBITED TRANSACTION RULES OF ERISA, THE CODE OR ANY
APPLICABLE SIMILAR LAWS.

**NOTICE TO INVESTORS**

The Notes have not been, and will not be, registered under the U.S. Securities Act or any state securities
laws and, unless so registered, may not be offered or sold except pursuant to an exemption from, or in
a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and applicable state
securities laws. Accordingly, the Notes offered hereby are being offered and sold only to QIBs in
reliance on Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act and to non-U.S. persons who are outside the United
States in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act.

In addition, until 40 days after the later of the commencement of the offering and the closing date, an
offer or sale of the Notes within the United States by a dealer (whether or not participating in the
offering) may violate the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act if such offer or sale is
made otherwise than pursuant to Rule 144A.

Each purchaser of Notes, by its acceptance thereof, will be deemed to have acknowledged, represented
to and agreed with us and the initial purchasers as follows:

(1) It understands and acknowledges that the Notes and the Note Guarantees have not been
registered under the U.S. Securities Act or any other applicable securities law, are being offered
for resale in transactions not requiring registration under the U.S. Securities Act or any state
securities law, including sales pursuant to Rule 144A, and may not be offered, sold or otherwise
transferred except in compliance with the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act
or any other applicable securities law, pursuant to an exemption therefrom or in any transaction
not subject thereto and in each case in compliance with the conditions for transfer set forth in
paragraph (5) below.

(2) It is not an “affiliate” (as defined in Rule 144 under the U.S. Securities Act) of the Issuer or any
Guarantor or acting on behalf of the Issuer or any Guarantor and it is either:

(i) a QIB and is aware that any sale of Notes to it will be made in reliance on Rule 144A
and the acquisition of Notes will be for its own account or the account of another QIB;
or

(ii) a non-U.S. person who is purchasing the Notes outside the United States in an offshore
transaction in accordance with Regulation S and if resident in a Member State in the
EEA or the United Kingdom, it is not a retail investor (for these purposes, a (1) retail
investor in the EEA means a person who is one (or more) of the following: (a) a retail
client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II, (ii) a customer within the
meaning of the Insurance Distribution Directive, where that customer would not qualify
as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II or (iii) not
a qualified investor as defined in the Prospectus Regulation and (2) a retail client in the
United Kingdom means (i) a retail client as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of
Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA;
or (ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of FSMA and any rules or
regulations made under FSMA to implement the Insurance Mediation Directive, where
that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (8) of Article
2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the
EUWA).

(3) It acknowledges that neither the Issuer, the Guarantors nor the initial purchasers, nor any person
representing the Issuer, the Guarantors or the initial purchasers, have made any representation
to it with respect to the offering or sale of any Notes, other than the information contained in
this offering memorandum, which offering memorandum has been delivered to it and upon
which it is relying in making its investment decision with respect to the Notes. It acknowledges
that neither the initial purchasers nor any person representing the initial purchasers makes any

434

representation or warranty as to the accuracy or completeness of the information contained in
this offering memorandum. It also acknowledges it has had access to such financial and other
information concerning us, the Issuer, the Guarantors, the Indenture, the Notes, the Note
Guarantees and the security documents as you deemed necessary in connection with your
decision to purchase any of the Notes, including an opportunity to ask questions of, and request
information from, the Issuer, the Guarantors and the initial purchasers.

(4) It is purchasing the Notes for its own account, or for one or more investor accounts for which
it is acting as a fiduciary or agent, in each case for investment, and not with a view to, or for
offer or sale in connection with, any distribution thereof in violation of the U.S. Securities Act
or any state securities laws, subject to any requirement of law that the disposition of its property
or the property of such investor account or accounts be at all times within its or their control
and subject to its or their ability to resell such Notes pursuant to Rule 144A, Regulation S or
any other exemption from registration available under the U.S. Securities Act.

(5) Each holder of Notes issued in reliance on Rule 144A agrees on its own behalf and on behalf
of any investor account for which it is purchasing the Notes, and each subsequent holder of the
Notes (as applicable) by its acceptance thereof will be deemed to agree, to offer, sell or
otherwise transfer such Notes only (i) to the Issuer, (ii) pursuant to a registration statement that
has been declared effective under the U.S. Securities Act, (iii) for so long as the Notes are
eligible pursuant to Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act, to a person it reasonably believes

that the transfer is being made in reliance on Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act, (iv)
pursuant to offers and sales to non-U.S. persons that occur outside the United States in
compliance with Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act, or (v) pursuant to any other
available exemption from the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act, subject in
each of the foregoing cases to any requirement of law that the disposition of its property or the
property of such investor account or accounts be at all times within its or their control and in
compliance with any applicable state securities laws and any applicable local laws and
regulations, and further subject to the Issuer’s and the Trustee’s rights prior to any such offer,
sale or transfer pursuant to clause (iv) or (v) to require the delivery of an opinion of counsel,
certification and/or other information satisfactory to each of them.

(6) You agree on your own behalf and on behalf of any investor account for which you are
purchasing the Notes, and each subsequent holder of such Notes by its acceptance thereof will
be deemed to agree, to offer, sell or otherwise transfer such Notes prior to the date (the “Resale
**Restriction Termination Date”) that is one year after the later of the date of the Issue Date**
and the last date on which we or any of our affiliates were the owner of such Notes (or any
predecessor thereto) only (i) to the Issuer, (ii) pursuant to a registration statement that has been
declared effective under the Securities Act, (iii) for so long as the Notes are eligible for resale
pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act, to a person you reasonably believe is a QIB

and sales to non-U.S. persons that occur outside the United States in compliance with
Regulation S under the Securities Act or (v) pursuant to any other available exemption from
the registration requirements of the Securities Act, subject in each of the foregoing cases to any
requirement of law that the disposition of its property or the property of such investor account
or accounts be at all times within its or their control and to compliance with any applicable state
securities laws, and any applicable local laws and regulations, and further subject to our and
the trustee’s rights prior to any such offer, sale or transfer (I) pursuant to clause (v) to require
the delivery of an opinion of counsel, certification and/or other information satisfactory to each
of them and (II) in each of the foregoing cases, to require that a certificate of transfer in the
form appearing on the reverse of the security is completed and delivered by the transferor to

435

the Trustee. The foregoing restrictions on resale will not apply subsequent to the Resale
Restriction Termination Date.

FLOOR, 44 ESPLANADE, ST HELIER, JERSEY JE4 9WG.

(8) It agrees that it will give to each person to whom it transfers the Notes notice of any restrictions
on transfer of such Notes, as applicable.

(9) It represents and warrants that either (1) no portion of the assets used by such purchaser or
transferee to acquire and hold the Notes constitutes Plan Assets or (2) the purchase and holding
of the Notes by such purchaser or transferee will not constitute or result in (a) a non-exempt
prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or a similar
violation under any applicable Similar Law and (b) none of the Transaction Parties have been
relied upon for any advice with respect to the purchaser or transferee’s decision to acquire and
hold the notes, and none of them shall at any time be relied upon as a fiduciary with respect to
any decision to acquire, continue to hold or transfer the notes and (B) it will not sell or otherwise
transfer such notes or any interest therein otherwise than to a purchaser or transferee that is

437


-----

deemed to make these same representations, warranties and agreements with respect to its
purchase and holding of such note or any interest therein.

(10) It acknowledges that until 40 days after the later of the commencement of the offering and the
closing date, any offer or sale of the Notes within the United States by a dealer (whether or not
participating in the offering) may violate the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities
Act if such offer or sale is made otherwise than in accordance with Rule 144A under the U.S.
Securities Act.

(11) It acknowledges that the Registrar will not be required to accept for registration of transfer any
Notes except upon presentation of evidence satisfactory to us and the Trustee that the
restrictions set out therein have been complied with.

(12) It understands that no action has been taken in any jurisdiction (including the United States) by
the Issuer or the initial purchasers that would result in a public offering of the Notes or the
possession, circulation or distribution of this offering memorandum or any other material
relating to us or Notes in any jurisdiction where action for such purpose is required.
Consequently, any transfer of the Notes will be subject to the selling restrictions set out under
“Plan of Distribution.”

It acknowledges that we, the initial purchasers and others will rely upon the truth and accuracy of the
foregoing acknowledgements, representations, warranties and agreements and agrees that if any of the
acknowledgements, representations, warranties and agreements deemed to have been made by its
purchase of the Notes is no longer accurate, it will promptly notify the initial purchasers. If it is acquiring
any Notes as a fiduciary or agent for one or more investor accounts, it represents that it has sole
investment discretion with respect to each such investor account and that it has full power to make the
foregoing acknowledgements, representations and agreements on behalf of each such investor account.

**CERTAIN TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

**United Kingdom Tax Considerations**

The following is a general description of certain UK tax consequences relating to the Notes and is based
on current UK tax law and HMRC published practice, both of which may be subject to change, possibly
with retrospective effect, relating only to the UK withholding tax treatment of payments of interest on
the Notes and UK stamp tax considerations on the issue or transfer of the Notes. References to “interest”
refer to interest as that term is understood for United Kingdom tax purposes. It does not purport to be a
complete analysis of all UK tax considerations relating to the Notes, does not purport to constitute legal
or tax advice, relates only to persons who are the absolute beneficial owners of the Notes and who hold
the Notes as a capital investment, and does not deal with certain classes of persons (such as brokers or
dealers in securities and persons connected with the Issuer) to whom special rules may apply. If you are
subject to tax in any jurisdiction other than the UK or if you are in any doubt as to your tax position,
you should consult an appropriate professional advisor.

**Interest on the Notes**

**_Payment of Interest on the Notes_**

Interest on the Notes will be payable without withholding or deduction for or on account of UK income
tax provided that the Notes carry a right to interest and are and remain listed on a “recognised stock
exchange” within the meaning of section 1005 of the Income Tax Act 2007. The Exchange is a
recognised stock exchange for these purposes. Securities will be treated as listed for this purpose if they
are officially listed in Guernsey in accordance with provisions corresponding to those generally
applicable in EEA states and are admitted to trading on the Exchange.

In most other cases, an amount must generally be withheld from payments of interest on the Notes on
account of UK income tax at the basic rate (currently 20%), unless an exemption or relief applies (for
instance, in connection with a direction by HMRC in respect of relief under an applicable double
taxation treaty).

References to payments of interest in this section include circumstances where additional Notes are
issued as PIK Interest (but, for the avoidance of doubt, do not include circumstances where the principal
amount of the outstanding Notes is increased by way of PIK Interest, on the basis that such increase to
principal should generally not be treated as being a “payment” for the purposes of the rules relating to
the withholding or deduction for or on account of UK income tax until such time as amounts in respect
of such interest are actually paid to Noteholders).

**_Guarantor Payments_**

If a Guarantor makes any payments in respect of interest on the Notes (or in respect of other amounts
due under the Notes other than the repayment of amounts subscribed for such Notes), such payments
may be subject to UK withholding tax at the basic rate (currently 20%), subject to such relief as may be
available under the provisions of any applicable double taxation treaty or any other relief which may
apply. Such payments by a Guarantor may not, however, be eligible for the exemptions from the
obligation to withhold tax described in the paragraphs above.

**_Australian Interest Withholding Tax on Payments by Australian Resident Guarantors_**

It is unclear whether or not any guarantee payments by an Australian resident Guarantor to a nonresident of Australia on account of interest owing by the Issuer in respect of the Notes would be subject
to Australian interest withholding tax (“Australian IWT”). There are good arguments that such
payments do not constitute “interest” for Australian withholding tax purposes, and, if so, would not be
subject to Australian IWT. If that is the case, non-Australian resident holders of the Notes may,

439


-----

depending upon all the relevant circumstances, be subject to Australian tax by assessment on those
amounts (subject to any applicable foreign income tax credits), and may be required to lodge an
Australian income tax return, unless an exemption applies.

The Australian Taxation Office (“ATO”) has, however, published Taxation Determination TD 1999/26
which suggests that the ATO considers guarantee payments made on behalf of a company borrower
would be “interest” for Australian IWT purposes. There is some doubt as to whether the reasoning
adopted in the Taxation Determination is strictly correct.

Interest paid on an overdue amount relating to an Australian resident Guarantor’s own obligations under
the Note Guarantees is likely to be interest on which Australian IWT applies, subject to an applicable
exemption.

**_Payment of Additional Amounts by Australian Resident Guarantors_**

If an Australian resident Guarantor will at any time be required by law to deduct or withhold an amount
in respect of any taxes imposed or levied by the Commonwealth of Australia, the Australian resident
Guarantor will, subject to certain exceptions, pay such Additional Amounts as may be necessary in
order that the net amounts received after such deduction or withholding will equal the respective
amounts that would have been received in the absence of such deduction or withholding.

In the event that an Australian resident Guarantor is or would be required by law to deduct or withhold
an amount in respect of any taxes in respect of the Notes as a result of a change in law and would be
required to pay Additional Amounts in respect of such taxes, the Issuer will have the option to redeem
the Notes in whole but not in part.

**_Further UK Tax Issues_**

Interest on the Notes that constitutes UK source income for tax purposes may be subject to UK tax by
way of direct assessment (including self-assessment) even where paid without withholding or
deduction.

However, interest with a UK source received without withholding or deduction for or on account of UK
income tax will not be chargeable to UK tax in the hands of a holder of the Notes who is not resident
for tax purposes in the UK (other than in the case of certain trustees) unless (i) that holder of the Notes
carries on a trade, profession or vocation in the UK through a branch or agency and in the case of holders
of the Notes who are companies through a permanent establishment in the UK; and (ii) the interest is
received in connection with, or the Notes are attributable to, that permanent establishment, branch or
agency. There are exemptions for interest received by certain categories of agent (such as some brokers
and investment managers). The provisions of an applicable double taxation treaty may also be relevant
for such holders of the Notes.

**_Stamp Duty and Stamp Duty Reserve Tax (“SDRT”)_**

No UK stamp duty or SDRT is payable on issue of, or on a transfer of, or agreement to transfer, the
Notes, provided that the Notes do not carry and will not at any time carry (i) a right to interest the
amount of which exceeds a reasonable commercial return on the nominal amount of the capital and (ii)
a right on repayment to an amount which exceeds the nominal amount of the capital and is not
reasonably comparable with what is generally repayable (in respect of a similar nominal amount of
capital) under the terms of issue of loan capital listed in the Official List of the Financial Conduct
Authority acting in its capacity as the competent authority for the purposes of Part VI of FSMA.

**Certain United States Federal Income Tax Considerations**

The following is a discussion of certain U.S. federal income tax considerations of the purchase,
ownership and disposition of the Notes, but does not purport to be a complete analysis of all potential
U.S. federal income tax considerations. This discussion is based upon the Code, Treasury regulations
issued thereunder (the “Treasury Regulations”), and judicial and administrative interpretations
thereof, each as in effect on the date hereof, and all of which are subject to change, possibly with
retroactive effect. This discussion is limited to consequences relevant to a U.S. Holder (as defined
below). This discussion does not address the impact of the U.S. federal Medicare tax on net investment
income, the effects of alternative minimum tax or the effects of any U.S. federal tax laws other than
U.S. federal income tax laws (such as estate and gift tax laws) or any state, local or non-U.S. tax laws.
No rulings from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) have been or are expected to be sought
with respect to the matters discussed below. There can be no assurance that the IRS will not take a
different position concerning the tax consequences of the purchase, ownership or disposition of the
Notes, or that any such position would not be sustained by a court.

This discussion does not address all of the U.S. federal income tax consequences that may be relevant
to a holder in light of such holder’s particular circumstances or to holders subject to special rules, such
as banks or other financial institutions, U.S. expatriates or entities subject to the U.S. anti-inversion
rules, insurance companies, dealers in securities or currencies, traders in securities, U.S. Holders whose
functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, tax-exempt entities and organizations, retirement and other
tax deferred accounts, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, holders subject to
special tax accounting rules as a result of any item of gross income with respect to the Notes being taken
into account in an applicable financial statement, partnerships or other pass-through entities (or
investors in such entities), persons holding Notes that are attributable to an office or other fixed place
of business maintained outside of the United States, persons who hold Existing Notes that are redeemed
pursuant to the Existing Notes Redemption, and persons holding the Notes as part of a “straddle,”
“hedge,” “conversion transaction” or other integrated transaction or a constructive sale transaction. In
addition, this discussion is limited to Notes purchased for cash at original issue and at their “issue price”
(i.e., the first price at which a substantial amount of the Notes is sold for money, not including sales to
bond houses, brokers or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters,
placement agents or wholesalers) and held as capital assets within the meaning of section 1221 of the
Code (generally, property held for investment).

For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner of a Note that is, for U.S. federal
income tax purposes, (i) an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States; (ii) a corporation
created or organized under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia;
(iii) an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or
(iv) a trust if a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the
administration of the trust and one or more “United States person” within the meaning of Section
7701(a)(30) of the Code (“U.S. Person”) has the authority to control all substantial decisions of the
trust, or if a valid election is in place to treat the trust as a U.S. Person.

If any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds the
Notes, the tax treatment of a partner in the partnership generally will depend upon the status of the
partner and the activities of the partnership. Partnerships that are considering an investment in the Notes,
and partners in such partnerships, should consult their tax advisors regarding the tax consequences of
the purchase, ownership and disposition of Notes.

The Issuer is disregarded as an entity separate from the Company for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
Accordingly, the Notes are treated as issued by the Company for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

**Prospective purchasers of Notes should consult their tax advisors concerning the tax**
**consequences of holding Notes in light of their particular circumstances, including the application**

441


-----

**of the U.S. federal income tax laws, as well as the application of U.S. federal tax laws other than**
**income tax laws (e.g., estate and gift tax laws), the U.S. federal Medicare tax on net investment**
**income, and state, local, non-U.S. or other tax laws.**

**_Effect of Certain Contingencies_**

In certain circumstances, we may be required to pay amounts in excess of stated interest or principal on
the Notes (see, e.g., “Description of Notes—Optional Redemption,” “Description of Notes—Optional
_Redemption upon any Tender Offer,” “Description of Notes—Change of Control,” “Description of_
_Notes—Redemption for Taxation Reasons,” and “Description of Notes—Withholding Taxes”). These_
potential payments may implicate the Treasury Regulations relating to “contingent payment debt
instruments.” However, according to the applicable Treasury Regulations, certain contingencies (e.g.,
contingencies that are in the aggregate, as of the date of issuance, remote or incidental) will not cause a
debt instrument to be treated as a contingent payment debt instrument. We intend to take the position
that, as of the date of issuance, the foregoing contingencies should not cause the Notes to be treated as
contingent payment debt instruments for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

Our determination that the Notes are not contingent payment debt instruments is binding on a U.S.
Holder, unless the U.S. Holder expressly discloses its contrary position in the manner required by
applicable Treasury Regulations (generally, on its U.S. federal income tax return for the year during
which the U.S. Holder acquires Notes). Our determination is not, however, binding on the IRS, and if
the IRS were to challenge our position successfully, a U.S. Holder may be required to accrue interest
income on its Notes at a rate in excess of the stated interest rate and to treat any gain recognized on the
taxable disposition of a note as ordinary income rather than as capital gain. Prospective U.S. Holders
should consult their own tax advisors regarding the potential application of the contingent payment debt
instrument Treasury Regulations to the Notes. The remainder of this discussion assumes that the Notes
will not be treated as contingent payment debt instruments.

**_Stated Interest_**

Stated interest on a Note (including any amounts withheld and any additional amounts paid in respect
of withholding taxes imposed on payments of stated interest on a Note) generally will be taxable to a
U.S. Holder as ordinary income at the time it is accrued or received in accordance with such U.S.
Holder’s regular method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

**_Original Issue Discount_**

If the stated principal amount of the Notes exceeds their issue price by an amount greater than or equal
to a statutorily defined de minimis amount (i.e., ¼ of 1% multiplied by the number of complete years
to maturity), then such series of Notes will be treated as issued with OID for U.S. federal income tax
purposes in an amount equal to the excess of the stated principal amount over the issue price of the
Notes.

If the Notes are treated as issued with OID for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a U.S. Holder generally
will be required to include in taxable income (as ordinary income) such OID as it accrues on a constant
yield to maturity basis, before the holder’s receipt of cash payments attributable to such OID, regardless
of the U.S. Holder’s regular method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The amount
of OID that a U.S. Holder is required to include in income for each taxable year (or potion thereof)
during which the U.S. Holder is the beneficial owner of a Note is the sum of the “daily portions” of
OID with respect to such Note for each day during such taxable year (or portion thereof), as determined
pursuant to applicable Treasury Regulations.

442


-----

**_Foreign Tax Credits_**

Stated interest income (as well as any withholding taxes and additional amounts paid in respect of any
withholding taxes imposed on payments on a Note) and any accrued OID on a Note generally will
constitute foreign source income and generally will be considered “passive category income” in
computing the foreign tax credit allowable to U.S. Holders under U.S. federal income tax laws. Any
non-U.S. withholding tax paid by or on behalf of a U.S. Holder may be eligible for foreign tax credits
(or deduction in lieu of such credits) for U.S. federal income tax purposes, subject to applicable
limitations. There are significant limitations on a U.S. Holder’s ability to claim foreign tax credits. The
rules governing the calculation of foreign tax credits are complex and depend on a U.S. Holder’s
particular circumstances, and Treasury Regulations have imposed additional requirements that must be
met for a foreign tax to be creditable. Recent notices from the IRS (i) indicate that the Treasury and the
IRS are considering proposing amendments to the applicable Treasury Regulations and (ii) allow
taxpayers, subject to certain conditions, to defer the application of many aspects of such regulations
until the date when a notice or other guidance withdrawing or modifying this temporary relief is issued
(or any later date specified in such notice or other guidance). Prospective U.S. Holders should consult
their tax advisors regarding the creditability or deductibility of any withholding taxes.

**_Sale, Exchange, Redemption. Retirement or Other Taxable Disposition of Notes_**

Upon the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. Holder
generally will recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the amount
realized (less an amount equal to any accrued but unpaid interest or any accrued OID, which will be
taxable as described above under “—Stated Interest” or “—Original Issue Discount,” to the extent not
previously included in income by the U.S. Holder) and the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Note.

A U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in a Note generally will equal the amount the U.S. Holder paid for
the Note, increased by any OID previously included in income in respect of the Note.

Any gain or loss recognized by a U.S. Holder upon the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other
taxable disposition of a Note generally will be U.S.-source capital gain or loss and will be long-term
capital gain or loss if the U.S. Holder has held the Note for more than one year at the time of such
disposition. In the case of a non-corporate U.S. Holder (including an individual), any such gain may be
eligible for preferential U.S. federal income tax rates if the U.S. Holder satisfies certain prescribed
minimum holding periods. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.

**_Information Reporting and Backup Withholding_**

In general, payments of principal and interest on a Note, any accruals of OID and/or the proceeds from
sales or other dispositions (including retirements or redemptions) of Notes held by a U.S. Holder may
be required to be reported to the IRS unless the U.S. Holder is an exempt recipient and, when required,
establishes this fact. In addition, a U.S. Holder that is not an exempt recipient may be subject to backup
withholding unless it provides a taxpayer identification number and otherwise complies with applicable
certification requirements. U.S. Holders may be required to provide such certification on IRS Form W9.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Amounts withheld as backup withholding may be credited
against a U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability and may entitle the holder to a refund, provided
that the appropriate information is timely furnished to the IRS.

**_Foreign Financial Asset Disclosure_**

Certain U.S. Holders who are individuals (and certain entities) that hold an interest in “specified foreign
financial assets” (which may include the Notes) are required to report information (on IRS Form 8938)
relating to such assets, subject to certain exceptions including an exception for Notes held in accounts

443


-----

maintained by certain financial institutions (in which case the accounts themselves are generally
reportable if maintained by non-U.S. financial institutions). U.S. Holders who fail to report the required
information could be subject to substantial penalties. Prospective U.S. Holders should consult their tax
advisors regarding the effect, if any, of this requirement on their ownership and disposition of Notes.

**_Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act_**

Pursuant to sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code (provisions commonly known as “FATCA”), and
subject to the proposed regulations discussed below, a “foreign financial institution” may be required
to withhold U.S. tax on certain foreign passthru payments made after December 31, 2018 to the extent
such payments are treated as attributable to certain U.S.-source payments. Obligations issued on or prior
to the date that is six months after the date on which applicable final regulations defining foreign
passthru payments are published in the U.S. Federal Register generally would be “grandfathered” unless
materially modified after such date. Accordingly, if we were treated as a foreign financial institution,
withholding under FATCA could apply to payments on the Notes only if there is a significant
modification of such Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes after the expiration of this
grandfathering period. Under proposed regulations, any withholding on foreign passthru payments on
Notes that are not otherwise grandfathered would apply to passthru payments made on or after the date
that is two years after the date of publication in the Federal Register of applicable final regulations
defining foreign passthru payments. Taxpayers generally may rely on these proposed regulations until
final regulations are issued. Non-U.S. governments have entered into agreements with the United States
(and additional non-U.S. governments are expected to enter into such agreements) to implement
FATCA in a manner that alters the rules described herein. Prospective U.S. Holders should consult their
tax advisors on how these rules may apply to their investment in Notes. In the event any withholding
under FATCA is imposed with respect to any payments on the Notes, there will be no additional
amounts payable to compensate for the withheld amount.

**Certain Jersey Tax Considerations**

**_Jersey Tax Considerations_**

The following summary of the anticipated treatment of the Issuer and holders of Notes (other than
residents of Jersey) is based on Jersey taxation law and practice as it is understood to apply at the date
of this document and may be subject to any changes in Jersey law occurring after such date. It does not
constitute legal or tax advice and does not address all aspects of Jersey tax law and practice (including
such tax law and practice as it applies to any land or building situate in Jersey. Accordingly, prospective
investors should consult their own tax advisers regarding tax considerations with respect to their
investment in the Issuer.

Holders of Notes should note that tax law and interpretation can change and that, in particular, the levels
and basis of, and reliefs from, taxation may change and may alter the benefits of the investment in the
Issuer.

**_General_**

Under the Income Tax (Jersey) Law 1961 (as amended) (“Tax Law”), the Issuer shall be regarded as
tax resident in Jersey if it is incorporated under the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991, as amended, unless:

- its business is centrally managed and controlled outside Jersey in a country or territory where
the highest rate at which any company may be charged to tax on any part of its income is 10%
or higher; and

- the Issuer is resident for tax purposes in that country or territory.

444


-----

It is intended that the Issuer will not be resident for tax purposes in Jersey and not subject to any rate of
tax in Jersey.

Under current Jersey law, there are no capital gains, capital transfer, gift, wealth or inheritance taxes or
any death or estate duties. No stamp duty is levied in Jersey on the issue or transfer of notes. On the
death of an individual holder of notes (whether or not such individual was resident in Jersey), duty at
rates of up to 0.75 per cent of the value of the relevant notes may be payable on the registration of Jersey
probate or letters of administration.

**_Goods and Services Tax (“GST”)_**

Pursuant to the Goods and Services Tax (Jersey) Law 2007 (the “2007 Law”), tax at a rate which is
currently 5 per cent applies to the supply of retail goods and services unless the relevant supplier or
recipient of such goods and service is registered as an “international services entity”.

The Issuer is an “international services entity” within the meaning of the 2007 Law, having satisfied
the requirements of the Goods and Services Tax (International Services Entity) (Jersey) Regulations
2008, as amended (the “ISE Regulations”) and, as long as it continues to be such an entity, a supply of
goods or of a service made by or to the Issuer will not be a taxable supply for the purposes of the 2007
Law.

**_Reporting_**

Drawing extensively on the intergovernmental approach to implementing the United States Foreign
Account Tax Compliance Act, the OECD developed the Common Reporting Standard (“CRS”) to
address the issue of offshore tax evasion on a global basis. Aimed at maximising efficiency and reducing
cost for financial institutions, the CRS provides a common standard for due diligence, reporting and
exchange of financial account information. Pursuant to the CRS, participating jurisdictions will obtain
from reporting financial institutions, and automatically exchange with exchange partners on an annual
basis, financial information with respect to all reportable accounts identified by financial institutions on
the basis of common due diligence and reporting procedures. Jersey has committed to implement the
CRS. As a result, the Issuer is required to comply with the CRS due diligence and reporting
requirements, as adopted by Jersey. Broadly, these are that the due diligence requirements under the
CRS framework as adopted by Jersey commenced on 1 January 2016, with information to be reported
to the Jersey Taxes Office from 30 June 2017. Information exchange between Jersey Revenue and
partner jurisdictions is automatic and has commenced.

Noteholders may be required to provide additional information to the Issuer to enable the Issuer to
satisfy its obligations under the CRS. Failure to provide requested information may subject an investor
to liability for any resulting penalties or other charges and/or mandatory redemption of Notes.

and the initial purchasers have agreed to purchase from us, pursuant to a purchase agreement between
the Issuer, the Guarantors, the Parent and the initial purchasers (the “Purchase Agreement”), the
principal amount of the Notes. The obligations of the initial purchasers under the Purchase
Agreement, including their agreement to purchase the Notes from us, are several and not joint.

The initial purchasers initially propose to offer the Notes for resale at the issue price that appears on the
cover of this offering memorandum. Depending on market conditions, certain of the initial purchasers
may decide to initially purchase and hold a portion of the Notes for their own accounts. After the initial
offering of the Notes, the initial purchasers may change the prices at which the Notes are offered and
any other selling terms at any time without notice. Certain of the initial purchasers may offer and sell
the Notes through one or more of their respective affiliates, or other registered broker-dealers or selling
agents. To the extent that any initial purchaser that is not a U.S. registered broker dealer intends to effect
any sales of Notes in the United States, it will do so through one or more U.S. registered broker dealer
affiliates as permitted by guidelines promulgated by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. The
materials relating to the Offering do not constitute, and may not be used in connection with an offer to
sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy, nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any place
where such offers, solicitations or sales are not permitted by law. If a jurisdiction requires that the
Offering be made by a licensed broker or dealer and the initial purchasers or any affiliate of the Initial
Purchasers is a licensed broker dealer in that jurisdiction, the Offering shall be deemed to be made by
the initial purchasers or such affiliate on behalf of the Issuer in such jurisdiction.

The Sponsors or their respective affiliates may place a purchase order for and be allocated the Notes at
a purchase price per Note equal to the issue price set forth on the cover page of this Offering
Memorandum.

The Purchase Agreement provides that the obligations of the initial purchasers to pay for and accept
delivery of the Notes are subject to, among other conditions, the delivery of certain legal opinions by
their counsel and our counsel.

The Purchase Agreement provides that the Issuer and each of the Guarantors will indemnify and hold
harmless the initial purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the U.S. Securities
Act, and will contribute to payments that the initial purchasers may be required to make in respect
thereof. The Company has agreed, subject to certain limited exceptions, that during the period from the
date hereof through and including the date that is 45 days after the date of the Purchase Agreement, to
not, and to cause its subsidiaries to not, without having received the prior written consent provided for
in the Purchase Agreement, offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of any debt securities issued
or guaranteed by the Company or any of its subsidiaries.

The Notes and the Note Guarantees have not been, and will not be, registered under the U.S. Securities
Act and may not be offered or sold within the United States except to QIBs in reliance on Rule 144A
and outside the United States to non-U.S. persons in reliance on Regulation S. Terms used in this
paragraph have the meanings given to them by Regulation S. Resales of the Notes are restricted as
described under “Notice to Investors.”

This offering memorandum is for distribution only to (i) persons who have professional experience in
matters relating to investments and who qualify as investment professionals within the meaning of
Article 19(5) of the Financial Promotion Order, (ii) high net worth bodies corporate and any other

Section 21 of FSMA) in connection with the issue or sale of any securities may otherwise lawfully be
communicated or caused to be communicated (all such persons together being referred to as “relevant
**persons”). This offering memorandum is directed only at relevant persons and must not be acted on or**
relied on by persons who are not relevant persons. Any investment or investment activity to which this
offering memorandum relates is available only to relevant persons and will be engaged in only with
relevant persons.

Each of the initial purchasers has represented, warranted and agreed that:

- it has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause
to be communicated an invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the
meaning of section 21 of FSMA) received by it in connection with the issue or sale of any Notes
in circumstances in which section 21(1) of FSMA does not apply to the Issuer or any Guarantor;
and

- it has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of FSMA with respect to
anything done by it in relation to any Notes in, from or otherwise involving the United
Kingdom.

This offering memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offering of the offered Notes in any
Member State of the EEA or the United Kingdom will be made pursuant to an exemption under
Prospectus Regulation and the UK Prospectus Regulation from the requirement to publish a prospectus
for offerings of securities. This offering memorandum is not a prospectus for purposes of the Prospectus
Regulation. This offering memorandum is not a prospectus for the purposes of the Prospectus
Regulation or the UK Prospectus Regulation.

No action has been taken in any jurisdiction, including the United States and the United Kingdom, by
us or the initial purchasers that would permit a public offering of the Notes or the possession, circulation
or distribution of this offering memorandum or any other material relating to us or the Notes in any
jurisdiction where action for this purpose is required. Accordingly, the Notes may not be offered or
sold, directly or indirectly, and neither this offering memorandum nor any other offering material or
advertisements in connection with the Notes may be distributed or published, in or from any country or
jurisdiction, except in compliance with any applicable rules and regulations of any such country or
jurisdiction. This offering memorandum does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer
to purchase in any jurisdiction where such offer or solicitation would be unlawful. Persons into whose
possession this offering memorandum comes are advised to inform themselves about and to observe
any restrictions relating to the offering of the Notes, the distribution of this offering memorandum and
resale of the Notes. See “Notice to Investors.”

The Issuer and the Guarantors have also agreed that they will not at any time offer, sell, contract to sell,
pledge or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, any securities under circumstances in which such
offer, sale, pledge, contract or disposition would cause the exemption afforded by Section 4(a)(2) of the
U.S. Securities Act or the safe harbors of Rule 144A and Regulation S to cease to be applicable to the
offer and sale of the Notes.

The Notes are new issues of securities for which there currently is no market. The Issuer will apply,
through its listing agent, to list the Notes on the Exchange and trade the Notes on the Official List
thereof. There can be no assurance that the Notes will be listed or traded on the Official List of the
Exchange or that such listing will be maintained.

447


-----

Certain initial purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market in the Notes as permitted
by applicable law. The initial purchasers are not obligated, however, to make a market in the Notes, and
any market-making activity may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the initial
purchasers without notice. In addition, any such market-making activity will be subject to the limits
imposed by the U.S. Securities Act and the U.S. Exchange Act.

Accordingly, the Issuer cannot assure you that any market for the Notes will develop, that it will be
liquid if it does develop or that you will be able to sell any Notes at a particular time or at a price which
will be favorable to you. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Note Guarantees and the
_Collateral—There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell_
_the Notes may be limited.”_

In connection with the Offering, the initial purchasers may purchase and sell the Notes in the open
market. These transactions may include short sales and purchases on the open market to cover positions
created by short sales. Short sales involve the sale by the initial purchasers of a greater principal amount
of Notes than they are required to purchase in the Offering. The initial purchasers must close out any
short position by purchasing Notes in the open market. A short position is more likely to be created if
the initial purchasers are concerned that there may be downward pressure on the price of the Notes in
the open market after pricing that could adversely affect investors who purchase in the Offering.

Similar to other purchase transactions, the initial purchasers’ purchases to cover the syndicate short
sales may have the effect of raising or maintaining the market price of the Notes or preventing or
retarding a decline in the market price of the Notes. As a result, the price of the Notes may be higher
than the price that might otherwise exist in the open market.

Neither we nor any of the initial purchasers make any representation or prediction as to the direction or
magnitude of any effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of the Notes. In
addition, neither we nor any of the initial purchasers make any representation that these transactions
will be engaged in or that these transactions, once commenced, will not be discontinued without notice.

The Issuer expects that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment on the Notes on or about
the date specified on the cover page of this offering memorandum, which will be     business days (as
such term is used for purposes of Rule 15c6-1 of the U.S. Exchange Act) and    business days in the
United Kingdom following the date of pricing of the Notes (this settlement cycle is being referred to as
“T +  ”). Under Rule 15c6-1 of the U.S. Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are
required to settle in two business days unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise.
Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes on the date of this offering memorandum or on
the next    successive business days will be required to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the
time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who wish to make such
trades should consult their own advisors.

The initial purchasers or their respective affiliates from time to time have provided in the past and may
provide in the future investment banking, commercial purpose lending, transaction and clearing
services, consulting and financial advisory services to us and our affiliates in the ordinary course of
business for which they may receive customary advisory and transaction fees and expense
reimbursement. Certain of the initial purchasers may from time to time also enter into swap and other
derivative transactions with us and our affiliates.

In addition, in the ordinary course of their business activities, the initial purchasers and their affiliates
may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related
derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the
accounts of their customers. Such investments and securities activities may involve securities and/or
instruments of the Ardonagh Group or Ardonagh Group’s affiliates. If the initial purchasers or their
affiliates have a lending relationship with the Issuer or its affiliates, certain of those initial purchasers

448

or their affiliates may routinely hedge, certain of those initial purchasers or their affiliates are likely to
hedge, and certain of those initial purchasers or their affiliates may hedge their credit exposure to the
Issuer and/or its affiliates consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, such
initial purchasers and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions that
consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in securities,
including potentially the Notes offered in the Offering. Any such short positions could adversely affect
future trading prices of Notes offered in the Offering. The initial purchasers and their affiliates may also
make investment recommendations or publish or express independent research views in respect of such
securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long or
short positions in such securities and instruments.

Certain initial purchasers or their respective affiliates are lenders under the Existing Revolving Credit
Facility, which will be amended and/or restated as part of the Transactions. Certain initial purchasers
or their respective affiliates will be lenders under the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities.

**WHERE YOU CAN FIND MORE INFORMATION**

Each purchaser of the Notes from the initial purchasers will be furnished with a copy of this offering
memorandum and any related amendments or supplements to this offering memorandum. Each person
receiving this offering memorandum acknowledges that (i) such person has been afforded an
opportunity to request from us, and has received, all additional information considered to be necessary
to verify the accuracy and completeness of the information herein; (ii) such person has not relied on the
initial purchasers or any person affiliated with the initial purchasers in connection with its investigation
of the accuracy of such information or its investment decision; and (iii) except as provided in clause (i),
no person has been authorized to give any information or to make any representation concerning the
Notes other than those contained herein, and, if given or made, such other information or representation
should not be relied upon as having been authorized by us or the initial purchasers.

We are not currently subject to the periodic reporting and other information requirements of the
Exchange Act. For so long as any of the Notes are “restricted securities” within the meaning of Rule
144(a)(3) under the U.S. Securities Act and the Issuer is neither subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the
U.S. Exchange Act, nor exempt from reporting pursuant to Rule 12g3-2(b) under the U.S. Exchange
Act, it will, upon the written request of any such person, furnish to any holder or beneficial owner of
Notes, or to any prospective purchaser designated by any such registered holder, the information
required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the U.S. Securities Act. Any such written
request should be directed to the relevant Paying Agent. Copies of such documents will be made
available at the registered office of the Issuer.

Pursuant to the Indenture, as applicable, and so long as the Notes are outstanding, we will furnish
periodic information to holders of the Notes. See “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—
_Reports.” For so long as the Notes are listed on the Exchange for trading on the Official List of the_
Exchange thereof and the rules of that exchange so require, copies of such information, the
organizational documents of each Issuer and each Guarantor, the most recent audited consolidated
financial statements of the Company, the Indenture (which includes the guarantees and the form of the
Notes), the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents will be available for review upon
written request (during normal business hours) on any business day at the registered office of the Issuer.
See “Listing and General Information.”

**SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL LIABILITIES**

The Issuer is a private limited company incorporated under the laws of Jersey. The Guarantors are
private limited companies incorporated under the laws of England and Wales, Jersey and Australia.
Certain of the directors, officers and other executives of the Issuer and the Guarantors are neither
residents nor citizens of the United States. Furthermore, certain of the assets of the directors and
executive officers of the Issuer and of the Guarantors are located outside the United States. As a result,
it may not be possible for you to serve process on such persons, the Issuer or the Guarantors in the
United States or to enforce judgments obtained in U.S. courts against them or the Issuer based on civil
liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States.

**Enforcement of U.S. Judgments in the United States**

The United States, Jersey and England currently are not parties to a treaty providing for the reciprocal
recognition and enforcement of judgments (as opposed to arbitration awards) in civil and commercial
matters.

Consequently, a final judgment for payment rendered by any federal or state court in the United States
based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws, would not
automatically be recognized or enforceable in Jersey or England. In order to enforce any such U.S.
judgment in Jersey or England, proceedings must first be initiated before a court of competent
jurisdiction in Jersey or England. In such an action, the Jersey or English courts would not generally
reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by the U.S. court (subject to what is stated below)
and it would usually be possible to obtain summary judgment on such a claim (assuming that there is
no good defense to it). Recognition and enforcement of a U.S. judgment by a Jersey or English court in
such an action is conditional upon (among other things) the following:

- the U.S. court having had jurisdiction over the original proceedings according to the Jersey and
English conflicts of laws principles (as applicable);

- the U.S. judgment being final and conclusive on the merits in the sense of being final and
unalterable in the court which pronounced it and being for a debt for a definite sum of money;

- the U.S. judgment not contravening Jersey or English public policy (as applicable);

- the U.S. judgment not being for a sum payable in respect of tax, or other charges of a like nature
in respect of a penalty or fine;

- within English courts, the U.S. judgment not having been arrived at by doubling, trebling or
otherwise multiplying a sum assessed as compensation for the loss or damages sustained and
not being otherwise in breach of Section 5 of the Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980 of
English Law as extended to Jersey by the Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980 (Jersey)
Order 1983);

- the U.S. judgment not having been obtained by fraud or in breach of Jersey or English principles
of natural justice (as applicable);

- judgment is not given in proceedings brought in breach of an agreement for settlement of
disputes;

- there not having been a prior inconsistent decision of a Jersey or English court between the
same parties; and

- the English enforcement proceedings being commenced within six years from the date of the
U.S. judgment.

453


-----

Subject to the foregoing, investors may be able to enforce in Jersey or England (as applicable)
judgments in civil and commercial matters that have been obtained from U.S. federal or state courts.
Nevertheless, there can be no assurance that those judgments will be recognized or enforceable in either
Jersey or England. In addition, it is questionable whether either a Jersey or English court would accept
jurisdiction and impose civil liability if the original action was commenced in Jersey or England,
respectively, instead of the United States, and predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws.

**Enforcement of U.S. Judgments in the Netherlands**

The Dutch Guarantor is incorporated under Dutch law. As a result, it may be difficult for investors to
enforce judgments obtained in non-Dutch courts against the Dutch Guarantor.

The Netherlands does not currently have a treaty with the United States providing for reciprocal
recognition and enforcement of judgments (other than arbitration awards) in civil and commercial
matters. Therefore, a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any court in any federal or
state court in the United States based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon United
States federal securities laws, would not be recognized or enforceable in The Netherlands. In order to
obtain a judgment which is enforceable in The Netherlands the claim must be relitigated before a
competent Dutch court and the judgment rendered by the non-Dutch court must be submitted in the
course of such proceedings, in which case the Dutch court will have to decide whether and to what
extent, given the circumstances of the case, it will recognize the foreign judgment. The relevant Dutch
court has discretion to attach such weight to a judgment of a U.S. Court as it deems appropriate. A
Dutch court will, under current practice, generally grant the same judgment without relitigation on the
merits if (a) the foreign judgment results from proceedings compatible with the Dutch concept of due
process (behoorlijke en met voldoende waarborgen omklede rechtspleging), (b) recognition of the
foreign judgment does not contravene public policy (openbare orde) of The Netherlands, (c) the
jurisdiction of the foreign court that has rendered the foreign judgment has been based on an
internationally recognized ground to accept jurisdiction and (d) the foreign judgment is not
incompatible with a judgment rendered between the same parties by a Dutch court, or with an earlier
judgment rendered between the same parties by a foreign court in a dispute that concerns the same
subject and is based on the same cause, provided that such earlier judgment qualifies for recognition in
The Netherlands.

Subject to the foregoing and service of process in accordance with applicable treaties, investors may be
able to enforce in the Netherlands judgments in civil and commercial matters obtained from U.S. federal
or state courts. However, no assurance can be given that those judgments will be enforceable. In
addition, it is uncertain whether a Dutch court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability in an
original action commenced in the Netherlands and predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws.

Moreover, a Dutch court may reduce the amount of damages granted by a U.S. court and recognize
damages only to the extent that they are necessary to compensate actual losses or damages. Enforcement
and recognition of judgments of U.S. courts in The Netherlands are solely governed by the provisions
of the Dutch Civil Procedure Code (Wetboek van Burgerlijke Rechtsvordering).

**Enforcement of U.S. Judgments in Jersey**

The United States and Jersey currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and
enforcement of judgments (as opposed to arbitration awards) in civil and commercial matters.
Consequently, a final judgment for payment rendered by any federal or state court in the United States
based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws, would not
automatically be recognized or enforceable in Jersey. In order to enforce any such U.S. judgment in
Jersey, proceedings must first be initiated before a court of competent jurisdiction in Jersey. In such an
action, the Royal Court would not generally reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by
the U.S. court (subject to what is said below) and it would usually be possible to obtain summary

454


-----

judgment on such a claim (assuming that there is no good defense to it). Recognition and enforcement
of a U.S. judgment by the Royal Court in such an action is conditional upon (among other things) the
following:

- the U.S. court having had jurisdiction over the original proceedings according to Jersey
conflicts of laws principles;

- the U.S. judgment being final and conclusive on the merits in the sense of being final and
unalterable in the court which pronounced it and being for a debt or definite sum of money
(although there are circumstances where non-money judgments may also be recognized);

- the recognition or enforcement of the U.S. judgment not contravening Jersey public policy,
including that the judgment was not obtained by fraud or duress and the observance of the
principles of natural justice which require, among other things, that documents in the US
proceedings were properly served on the defendant and that the defendant was given the right
to be heard and represented by counsel in a free and fair trial before an important tribunal;

- the U.S. judgment not being for a sum payable in respect of taxes, or other charges of a like
nature, or in respect of a penalty or fine;

- the U.S. judgment not having been arrived at by doubling, trebling or otherwise multiplying a
sum assessed as compensation for the loss or damages sustained and not being otherwise in
breach of Section 5 of the United Kingdom Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980 (as
extended to Jersey by the Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980 (Jersey) Order 1983); and

- there not having been a prior inconsistent decision of a Jersey court in respect of the same
matter.

Subject to the foregoing, investors may be able to enforce in Jersey judgments in civil and commercial
matters that have been obtained from U.S. federal or state courts. However, we cannot assure you that
those judgments will be recognized or enforceable in Jersey. In addition, it is questionable whether the
Royal Court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability if the original action was commenced
in Jersey, instead of the United States, and predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws.

**Enforcement of U.S. Judgments in Australia**

There is doubt as to the enforceability in Australia in original actions or in actions for enforcement of
judgments of United States courts, of civil liabilities predicated solely upon the civil liability provisions
of the federal or state securities laws of the United States.

No assurance can be given that judgments of a United States court will be enforceable in Australia. In
addition, no assurance can be made as to whether or not an Australian court would accept jurisdiction
and impose civil liability in an original action commenced in Australia and predicated solely upon U.S.
federal securities laws.

Generally, foreign judgments can be enforced in Australia by registering the judgment under the
_Foreign Judgments Act 1991 (Cth). This regime is based on reciprocity of enforcement and only foreign_
judgments issued by courts or countries set out in the Foreign Judgments Regulations 1992 (Cth) may
be registered.

There are no reciprocal arrangements between Australia and the United States, and accordingly,
judgments obtained from a New York court (or courts in another United States jurisdiction) cannot be
registered and enforced under the Foreign Judgments Act 1991 (Cth).

455


-----

To enforce such a judgment in Australia, the judgment creditor will need to bring fresh proceedings at
common law either relying on the foreign judgment as creating a debt, or bringing a cause of action
based on the original cause of action relying on the foreign judgment to estop the judgment creditor
from raising any defense. To be recognized and enforced in Australia, a U.S. judgment must satisfy the
following conditions:

- the U.S. judgment must be final and conclusive, in that it must end the proceeding and the
dispute to which the proceeding relates and the matter was not the subject of an earlier final
and conclusive judgment by another court having jurisdiction;

- the U.S. judgment must be for a fixed or readily ascertainable sum and not in the nature of a
tax, fine or penalty;

- the parties to the U.S. judgment must be identical to the parties to the Australian enforcement
proceeding;

- the U.S. court awarding the judgment had jurisdiction over the judgment debtor at the time of
exercising jurisdiction, and this jurisdiction must be recognized under Australian conflict of
law rules – this requirement will usually be satisfied where the judgment debtor was ordinarily
resident or present in the U.S. at the time the proceeding was served, or otherwise voluntarily
submitted to the jurisdiction of the U.S. court;

- the U.S. judgment is not in respect of taxes, a foreign revenue debt or a penalty/fine imposed
by U.S. (or any foreign) law;

- the U.S. judgment must not be wholly satisfied (and enforcement must only be sought to the
extent the judgment is not satisfied); and

- the enforcement proceeding must have been commenced within any applicable limitation
periods.

The party bringing the application must advance sufficient evidence of these elements.

A judgment debtor may seek to defend the enforcement of a U.S. judgment on the basis that either:

- the U.S. judgment was obtained by fraud or duress;

- the U.S. judgment is contrary to Australian public policy or general principles of fairness;

- the judgment debtor was denied natural justice before the U.S. court (for example, if they did
not receive notice of the proceedings in sufficient time to enable them to defend the case);

- enforcement of the U.S. judgment in Australia would amount to the enforcement of a U.S. penal
or revenue law; or

- there is a prior judgment in another court between the same parties concerning the same issues
as are dealt with in the U.S. judgment.

The Australian Attorney General may also make a declaration under the Foreign Proceedings (Excess
_of Jurisdiction) Act 1984 (Cth)_ in respect of a U.S. judgment in relation to anti-trust proceedings,
resulting in the judgment not being enforceable in Australia or enforceable only in respect of an amount
less than the amount of the U.S. judgment as specified by the Australian Attorney General.

**Enforcement of U.S. Judgments in Cayman Islands**

456


-----

The courts of the Cayman Islands are unlikely (i) to recognise or enforce against judgments of courts
of the United States predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United
States or any State; and (ii) in original actions brought in the Cayman Islands, to impose liabilities
against a company predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United
States or any State, so far as the liabilities imposed by those provisions are penal in nature. In those
circumstances, although there is no statutory enforcement in the Cayman Islands of judgments obtained
in the United States, the courts of the Cayman Islands will recognise and enforce a foreign money
judgment of a foreign court of competent jurisdiction without retrial on the merits based on the principle
that a judgment of a competent foreign court imposes upon the judgment debtor an obligation to pay
the sum for which judgment has been given provided certain conditions are met. For such a foreign
judgment to be enforced in the Cayman Islands, such judgment must be final and conclusive and for a
liquidated sum, and must not be in respect of taxes or a fine or penalty, inconsistent with a Cayman
Islands judgment in respect of the same matter, impeachable on the grounds of fraud or obtained in a
manner, and or be of a kind the enforcement of which is, contrary to natural justice or the public policy
of the Cayman Islands (awards of punitive or multiple damages may well be held to be contrary to
public policy). A Cayman Islands Court may stay enforcement proceedings if concurrent proceedings
are being brought elsewhere.

**Enforcement of Judgments against the Irish Security Providers**

As the United States is not a party to a convention with the Republic of Ireland in respect of the
enforcement of judgments, common law rules apply in order to determine whether a judgment of the
courts of the State of New York is enforceable in the Republic of Ireland. A judgment of the courts of
the State of New York will be enforced by the courts of the Republic of Ireland if the following general
requirements are met:

(i) the judgment must be for a definite sum of money;

(ii) the courts of the State of New York must have had jurisdiction in relation to the particular
defendant according to the Republic of Ireland conflict of law rules (the submission to jurisdiction
by the defendant would satisfy this rule); and

(iii) the judgment must be final and conclusive and the decree must be final and unalterable in the
court which pronounces it. A judgment can be final and conclusive even if it is subject to appeal
or even if an appeal is pending. Where however, the effect of lodging an appeal under the
applicable law is to stay execution of the judgment, it is possible that, in the meantime, the
judgment should not be actionable in the Republic of Ireland. It remains to be determined whether
final judgment given in default of appearance is final and conclusive.

However, the Irish courts may refuse to enforce a judgment of the courts of the State of New York,
which meets the above requirements, for one of the following reasons:

(i) if the judgment was obtained by fraud;

(ii) the enforcement of the judgment in the Republic of Ireland would be contrary to natural or
constitutional justice;

(iii) the judgment is contrary to the Republic of Ireland public policy or involves certain United States
laws which will not be enforced in the Republic of Ireland; or

(iv) jurisdiction cannot be obtained by the Irish courts over the judgment debtors in the enforcement
proceedings by personal service in the Republic of Ireland or outside the Republic of Ireland under
Order 11 of the Superior Courts Rules.

Pursuant to Article 4 of Council Regulation (EC) No 2271/96 of November 22, 1996, as amended by
Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2018/1100 (the “Blocking Statute”), no judgment of a court
or tribunal and no decision of an administrative authority located outside of the European Union giving
effect, directly or indirectly, to the laws specified in the annex to the Blocking Statute or to actions

based thereon will be recognized or be enforceable in any manner by the courts of the Republic of
Ireland.

**CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS**

_The following is a brief description of certain insolvency law considerations in the jurisdictions in which_
_Note Guarantees and the Collateral are initially being provided. The descriptions below do not purport_
_to be complete or discuss all of the limitations or considerations that may affect the Notes, the Note_
_Guarantees or the Collateral. Proceedings of bankruptcy, insolvency or a similar event could be_
_initiated in any of these jurisdictions and in the jurisdiction of organization of a future Guarantor or_
_provider of Collateral. The application of these various laws in multiple jurisdictions could trigger_
_disputes over which jurisdiction’s law should apply and could adversely affect your ability to enforce_
_your rights and to collect payment in full under the Notes, the Note Guarantees and the Collateral, as_
_applicable. Prospective investors in the Notes should consult their own legal advisors with respect to_
_such limitations and considerations. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Structure and the_
_Financing.”_

**England and Wales**

Certain of the Guarantors and providers of Collateral are companies incorporated under the laws of
England and Wales (the “English Obligors”). Therefore, any insolvency proceedings by or against the
English Obligors would likely be based on English insolvency laws. However, as discussed in the
**European Union section below, pursuant to the** **EU** Insolvency Regulation, as amended by the
Insolvency (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (SI 2019/146) (as amended), where a company
incorporated under English law has its COMI in a Member State of the European Union other than
Denmark, any main insolvency proceedings for that company would, subject to certain exceptions, be
opened in the Member State in which its COMI is located and be, subject to certain exceptions set out
in Articles 8 to 18 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, subject to the laws of that Member State.

Similarly, the Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations 2006 (SI 2006/1030) and the Cross-Border
Insolvency Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2007 (2007 No. 115), which implement the UNCITRAL
Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency in the United Kingdom, provide that a foreign (i.e., nonEnglish) court may have jurisdiction where any English company has its **COMI in such foreign**
jurisdiction, or where it has an “establishment” (being a place of operations in such foreign jurisdiction,
where it carries out non-transitory economic activities with human means and assets or services).

Although the scope of the English courts’ jurisdiction varies for the different insolvency proceedings
available in England and Wales, English courts generally have jurisdiction to open insolvency
proceedings in respect of any company which has its COMI in the UK or which has its COMI in an EU
member state (other than Denmark) and an “establishment” in the UK. While this allows English courts
to assume jurisdiction over certain foreign companies in respect of certain insolvency proceedings, the
efficacy of such proceedings will significantly depend on the likelihood and extent of subsequent
recognition of such proceedings in relevant other jurisdictions.

The recognition of English courts’ jurisdiction and orders in respect of schemes of arrangement and
restructuring plan processes, which are restructuring rather than insolvency proceedings, will be subject
to treaties regarding matters relating to the jurisdiction of courts in civil proceedings and the
enforcement of civil judgments such as the Hague Convention on Choice of Court Agreements 2005
and the Lugano Convention 2007 (subject to the UK’s pending accession to the latter) where these
apply. In addition, recognition may still be available under principles of private international law and
(in the case of EU member states other than Denmark) Regulation (EC) No 593/2008 of the European
Parliament and of the Council of 17 June 2008 on the law applicable to contractual obligations (“Rome
**I”). Rome I was incorporated with minor amendments into English law pursuant to The Law Applicable**
to Contractual Obligations and Non-Contractual Obligations (Amendment etc.) (EU Exit) Regulations
2019, which came into force at the end of the Transition Period.

459


-----

Formal insolvency proceedings under the laws of England and Wales may be initiated in a number of
ways, including by the company or a creditor making an application for administration in court, the
company (or its directors) or the holder of a “qualifying floating charge” in respect of the company’s
property (discussed below) making an application for administration out of court, or by a creditor filing
a petition to wind up the company or the company resolving to do so (in the case of a liquidation). The
following is a brief description of certain aspects of English insolvency law relating to certain
limitations on the Note Guarantees and the security interests over the Collateral. The application of
these laws could adversely affect investors, their ability to enforce their rights under the Note
Guarantees and/or the Collateral securing the Notes and therefore may limit the amounts that investors
may receive in an insolvency of any English Obligor.

**_Recognition in the EU_**

Following the UK’s departure from the EU and the expiry of the Transition Period, UK proceedings no
longer benefit from automatic and guaranteed recognition in EU member states. As the trade and
cooperation terms agreed between the EU and the UK do not include a regime for the automatic
recognition of UK insolvency procedures across the EU (and vice versa) or otherwise address
insolvency matters, cross-border insolvencies involving the UK and one or more EU member states are
subject to a degree of uncertainty and increased complexity.

As a result, it may be more problematic for UK restructuring and insolvency proceedings to be
recognized in EU member states and for UK office holders to effectively deal with assets located in EU
member states than it was during and prior to the Transition Period. The general position outlined above
will apply and recognition will depend on the private international law rules adopted in the relevant EU
member state. It may be necessary to open parallel proceedings, increasing the element of risk as well
as costs. In particular in cases where the appointment of a UK office holder is made in reliance on a UK
domestic approach rather than COMI rules, it is much less certain that such appointment will be
recognized in EU member states. To the extent relevant proceedings are deemed to fall within the remit
of contract law, Rome I may offer an alternative basis for recognition in EU member states other than
Denmark.

As a consequence, the recognition of English insolvency and restructuring proceedings across the EU
member states may be different from what investors may have experienced in the past when the UK
was a member state of the EU or during the Transition Period. It is not possible to predict with certainty
if and to what extent proceedings will be recognized and whether investors may be adversely affected
as a result.

**_Administration_**

Under the Insolvency Act 1986 (the “Insolvency Act”), it is possible for a qualified insolvency
practitioner to be appointed as an administrator of (i) a company registered under the Companies Act
2006 in England and Wales or Scotland, (ii) a company incorporated in a member state of the European
Economic Area or (iii) a company not incorporated in a member state of the European Economic Area
but having its COMI in an EU member state (other than Denmark) or in the UK. A court order is not
necessarily required for such an appointment.

Subject to specific conditions, a court can make an administration order if the court is satisfied that the
relevant company is or is likely to become “unable to pay its debts” and that the administration order is
reasonably likely to achieve the purpose of administration. Pursuant to section 123 of the Insolvency
Act a company is unable to pay its debts if it is insolvent on a “cash flow” basis (unable to pay its debts
as they fall due) or if it is insolvent on a “balance sheet” basis (the value of the company’s assets is less
than the amount of its liabilities, taking into account its contingent and prospective liabilities). Such
insolvency is presumed if, among other matters, the company fails either to satisfy a creditor’s statutory
demand for a debt exceeding £750 within 21 days of service or to satisfy in full or in part a judgment

460


-----

debt (or similar court order). Without limitation and subject to specific conditions, an English company,
the directors of such company or the holder of a qualifying floating charge in respect of the company’s
property (discussed below), where the floating charge has become enforceable, may also appoint an
administrator out of court. If the appointor holds a qualifying floating charge in respect of the company’s
property, there is no requirement that the company is or is likely to become unable to pay its debts.

The purpose of an administration is comprised of three objectives that must be looked at successively:
rescuing the company as a going concern or, if that is not reasonably practicable, achieving a better
result for the company’s creditors as a whole than would be likely upon immediate liquidation or, if
neither of those objectives is reasonably practicable, and the interests of the creditors as a whole are not
unnecessarily harmed thereby, realizing property to make a distribution to one or more secured or
preferential creditors.

The rights of creditors, including secured creditors, are curtailed in an administration pursuant to the
statutory moratorium imposed under the Insolvency Act. Upon the appointment of an administrator, no
step may be taken to enforce security over the company’s property except with the consent of the
administrator or permission of the court. The same requirements for consent or permission apply to the
institution or continuation of legal process (including legal proceedings, execution, distress and
diligence) against the company or property of the company. In either case, a court will consider
discretionary factors in determining any application for leave in light of the hierarchy of statutory
objectives of administration described above.

Accordingly, if any of the Issuer, the Guarantors or the providers of Collateral were to enter
administration, the Notes, the Note Guarantees and the Collateral, as applicable, could not be enforced
against that company while it was in administration without the permission of the court or consent of
the administrator. There can be no assurance that the Trustee, or the Security Agent, as applicable,
would obtain this permission of the court or consent of the administrator.

In addition, while an administrator is in office, the powers of the directors of the relevant company
cease (save for those powers that do not interfere with the exercise of the administrator’s powers, and
those permitted by the administrator) and the administrator has primary responsibility for managing the
company’s affairs. An administrator is given wide powers to conduct the business of the company to
which he or she is appointed and, subject to certain requirements under the Insolvency Act, dispose of
the property of a company in administration, including property subject to a floating charge. In the case
of property subject to a fixed charge, an administrator has no power to dispose of that property clear of
the fixed charge without the agreement of the relevant charge holder or a court order. Such a court order
is discretionary and may be made only where the court thinks the disposal would be likely to promote
the purpose of administration. If such an order is made, it will be conditional upon the administrator
applying the net proceeds of the disposal, together with any additional sum required to produce the net
amount the court determines would be realised on a sale at a market value, towards discharging the
sums secured by the fixed charge. The administrator also has the ability to challenge certain antecedent
transactions.

However, the general prohibition against enforcement by secured creditors without consent of the
administrator or permission of the court, and the administrator’s powers with respect to property subject
to a floating charge, does not apply to any security interest created or arising under a financial collateral
arrangement within the meaning of the Financial Collateral Agreements (No. 2) Regulations 2003 (SI
2003/3226) (U.K.) (the “Financial Collateral Regulations”). A financial collateral arrangement
includes (subject to certain other conditions) a security interest over financial collateral (including a
floating charge, a pledge, a mortgage, a fixed charge or a lien) in a company, where both the collateral
provider and collateral taker are non-natural persons. If an arrangement qualifies as a financial collateral
arrangement under the Financial Collateral Regulations certain modifications or exclusions to English
insolvency law apply which remove restrictions on enforcing security, disapply provisions relating to

461


-----

the order of payment of creditors and prohibit avoidance by the insolvency office-holder of the financial
collateral arrangement in certain situations.

**_Qualifying floating charges_**

If a company grants a “qualifying floating charge” in respect of such company’s property to a party for
the purposes of English insolvency law, that party may make an application for administration out of
court. In order to constitute a qualifying floating charge for these purposes, the floating charge must be
created by an instrument which (a) states that the relevant statutory provision applies to it; or (b)
purports to empower the holder to appoint an administrator of the company. A party will be the holder
of a qualifying floating charge if it holds one or more debentures of the company secured: (a) by a
qualifying floating charge which relates to the whole or substantially the whole of the company’s
property; (b) by a number of qualifying floating charges which together relate to the whole or
substantially the whole of the company’s property; or (c) by charges and other forms of security which
together relate to the whole or substantially the whole of the company’s property and at least one of
which is a qualifying floating charge.

If an administrative receiver has been appointed, an administrator can only be appointed by the court
(and not by the company, its directors or the holder of a qualifying charge using the out of court
procedure) and then only if the person who appointed the administrative receiver consents or the court
considers that the security pursuant to which the administrative receiver was appointed is invalid. If an
administrator is appointed, any administrative receiver will vacate office, and any receiver of part of
the company’s property must resign if required to do so by the administrator.

**_Fixed charge receivership_**

A fixed charge receiver (as opposed to an administrative receiver) may be appointed over some or all
of the assets secured by a fixed charge in accordance with the terms of a security document creating a
fixed charge or (in limited circumstances) pursuant to statute.

If appointed under the terms of a security agreement, grounds for appointment under the terms of the
charge (such as a default) must exist and the charging company must have failed to satisfy the demand
made for an appointment to take place. A fixed charge receiver can be appointed in parallel to a
liquidator. An administrator may require a fixed charge receiver to vacate office unless that fixed charge
receiver was appointed under a charge which falls within the definition of a “security financial collateral
arrangement”, as per regulation 8(4) of the Financial Collateral Regulations.

The primary duty of the fixed charge receiver is to realize the assets over which (s)he is appointed,
meaning (s)he owes an over-riding duty of care to the appointor. This contrasts with the duty of an
administrator, who performs their duties in the interests of a company’s creditors as a whole. In other
words, receivership is a proprietary remedy whereas administration is a collective procedure. In
realizing the charged assets, the receiver will need to take reasonable care to obtain the best price
obtainable in the circumstances. In doing so, the fixed charge receiver will be entitled to a statutory
indemnity in respect of any liabilities from the realizations made of the assets of the company (and may
also have the benefit of a contractual indemnity from the appointor).

To the extent the receiver has been appointed under a crystallized floating charge, amounts will be
deducted from the proceeds of the realization of the charged assets to pay the Prescribed Part and any
preferential creditors (see “Priority on insolvency” below).

There is no moratorium in a fixed charge receivership, so creditors can enforce any rights that are
consistent with the priority of the security, including exercising rights of set-off and forfeiture,
collecting goods that are subject to valid retention of title claims and, subject to certain Insolvency Act
limitations on the effectiveness of ipso facto clauses where applicable, terminating contracts.

462


-----

If a company is already in administration, the moratorium on creditor action will prevent the
appointment of a fixed charge receiver unless the administrator consents or the court permits the
appointment, or an exception to the moratorium applies.

**_Liquidation/winding-up_**

Liquidation is a company dissolution procedure under which the assets of a company are realized and
distributed by the liquidator to creditors and (if applicable) members in the statutory order of priority
prescribed by the Insolvency Act. Once the liquidator has completed this task, the company is dissolved
and removed from the register of companies. There are two forms of winding-up: (i) compulsory
liquidation, by order of the court; and (ii) voluntary liquidation, by resolution of the company’s
members, and which is in turn divided into members’ voluntary liquidation (“MVL”) and creditors’
voluntary liquidation (“CVL”). The primary ground for the compulsory winding-up of an insolvent
company is that it is unable to pay its debts (as described above).

Companies registered in England and Wales or foreign companies with their COMI in England and
Wales, with their COMI in an EU member state (other than Denmark) and an “establishment” in
England and Wales or which have a “sufficient connection” with England and Wales to justify the court
exercising its jurisdiction may be wound up via compulsory liquidation. Only companies registered in
England and Wales may be subject to voluntary liquidation (save that a foreign company where its
COMI is in England and Wales or in an EU member state (except Denmark) but which has an
“establishment” in England and Wales may enter a creditors’ voluntary liquidation).

A creditor, the company or in certain circumstances a shareholder, among others, can present a windingup petition to the Court for the compulsory winding-up of a company. The most common grounds for
the compulsory winding up of a company is that either it is unable to pay its debts (as defined in Section
123 of the Insolvency Act) or the court is of the opinion that it is just and equitable for the company to
be wound up.

The effect of a compulsory winding-up differs in a number of respects from that of a voluntary windingup. In a compulsory winding-up, under section 127 of the Insolvency Act, any disposition of the relevant
company’s property made after the commencement of the winding-up is, unless sanctioned by the court,
void. However, this will not apply to any property or security interest subject to a disposition or
otherwise arising under a financial collateral arrangement under the Financial Collateral Regulations
and will not prevent a close-out netting provision taking effect in accordance with its terms. Subject to
certain exceptions, when an order is made for the winding-up of a company by the court, it is deemed
to have commenced from the time of the presentation of the winding-up petition. Once a winding-up
order is made by the court, a stay of all proceedings against the company will be imposed. No legal
action may be continued or commenced against the company without permission of the court.

In the context of a voluntary winding-up however, there is no equivalent to the retrospective effect of a
winding up order; the winding up commences on the passing of the resolution to wind up. As a result,
there is no equivalent of section 127 of the Insolvency Act for a voluntary winding-up. There is also no
automatic stay in the case of a voluntary winding-up—it is for the liquidator, or any creditor or
shareholder of the company, to apply for a stay. This is important because, in the absence of a stay being
obtained, it means secured creditors for example can go ahead and enforce their security.

A MVL is a solvent liquidation that is controlled by the shareholders. It commences when the
shareholders pass a special resolution to place the company into liquidation and there is no involvement
by the court. Not more than five weeks prior to the making of the winding up resolution, the directors
must swear a statutory declaration of solvency stating that, after having made full enquiry into the
company’s affairs, they have formed the opinion that it will be able to pay its debts, including interest
and the costs of the MVL process, within a stated period not exceeding 12 months from the start of the
liquidation.

463


-----

A CVL is also commenced by the shareholders resolving to place the company into liquidation and has
no court involvement. In contrast to an MVL, however, the directors do not swear a statutory declaration
of solvency for a CVL (meaning the company can be solvent or insolvent). If the creditors choose a
different person to act as liquidator from the shareholders, the creditors’ choice will prevail.

On the appointment of a liquidator, the directors’ powers to bind the company automatically cease, save
for those powers that are sanctioned by the liquidator or creditors (as appropriate). A liquidator has,
among other things, the power to bring or defend legal proceedings on behalf of the company, to carry
on the business of the company as far as it is necessary for its beneficial winding up, to sell the
company’s property (provided that in respect of the sale of any property that is secured by a fixed charge
in favour of a creditor, if that sale is made without the secured creditor’s consent, it will be made subject
to that security, as the creditor’s consent will be needed to the release of the security),execute documents
in the name of the company and to challenge antecedent transactions.

**_Priority on insolvency_**

With the exception of the Prescribed Part (as defined below), distributions generally cannot be made to
a class of creditors until the claims of the creditors in a prior ranking class have been paid in full. Unless
creditors have agreed otherwise, distributions are made on a _pari passu basis, that is, the assets are_
distributed in proportion to the debts due to each creditor within a class.

The general priority on insolvency is as follows (in descending order of priority) and subject to certain
circumstances in which super priority is afforded to moratorium debts and priority pre-moratorium
debts in accordance with Section 174A of the Insolvency Act and paragraph 64A of Schedule B1 of the
Insolvency Act (see “Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020” below):

- First ranking: holders of fixed charge security (but only to the extent the value of the secured
assets covers that indebtedness) and creditors with a proprietary interest in assets in the
possession (but not full legal and beneficial ownership) of the debtor but only with respect to
the assets in which they have a proprietary interest;

- Second ranking: expenses of the insolvent estate incurred during the relevant insolvency
proceedings (there are statutory provisions setting out the order of priority in which expenses
are paid);

- Third ranking: preferential creditors. Ordinary preferential debts include (but are not limited to)
debts owed by the insolvent company in relation to: (i) contributions to occupational and state
pension schemes; (ii) wages and salaries of employees for work done in the four months before
the insolvency date, up to a maximum of £800 per person; (iii) holiday pay due to any employee
whose contract has been terminated, whether the termination takes place before or after the
insolvency date; and (iv) bank and building deposits eligible for compensation under the
Financial Services Compensation Scheme (“FSCS”) up to the statutory limit. Secondary
preferential debts include (i) bank and building deposits eligible for compensation under the
FSCS to the extent that claims exceed the statutory limit, and rank for payment after the
discharge of the ordinary preferential debts and (ii) claims by HMRC in respect of certain taxes
including VAT, PAYE income tax (including student loan repayments), employee NI
contributions and Construction Industry Scheme deductions (but excluding corporation tax and
employer NI contributions) which are held by the company on behalf of employees and
customers. As between one another, all claims within each category rank equally;

- Fourth ranking: holders of floating charge security, according to the priority of their security.
This would include any floating charge that was stated to be a fixed charge in the document
that created it but which, on a proper interpretation, was rendered a floating charge. However,
before distributing asset realizations to the holders of floating charges, the Prescribed Part (as

464


-----

defined below) must, subject to certain exceptions, be set aside for distribution to unsecured
creditors;

- Fifth ranking:

(a) firstly, provable debts of unsecured creditors (save where such creditors are deferred
under section 74(2(f)) of the Insolvency Act) and any secured creditor to the extent of
any unsecured shortfall, in each case including accrued and unpaid interest on those
debts up to the date of commencement of the relevant insolvency proceedings. These
debts rank equally among themselves unless there are subordination agreements in
place between any of them. To pay the secured creditors any unsecured shortfall, the
insolvency officeholder can only use realizations from unsecured assets, as secured
creditors are not entitled to any distribution from the Prescribed Part unless the
Prescribed Part is sufficient to pay out all unsecured creditors;

(b) secondly, interest on the company’s unsubordinated debts (at the higher of the
applicable contractual rate and the official rate) in respect of any period after the
commencement of liquidation, or after the commencement of any administration which
either preceded such liquidation or which were converted into a liquidating
administration. However, in the case of interest accruing on amounts due under the
Notes or the Note Guarantees, such interest due to the holders of the Notes may, if there
are sufficient realizations from the secured assets, be discharged out of such security
recoveries; and

(c) thirdly, non-provable liabilities, being liabilities that do not fall within any of the
categories above and therefore are only recovered in the (unusual) event that all
categories above are fully paid.

- Sixth ranking: shareholders. If after the repayment of all unsecured creditors in full, any
remaining funds exist, these will be distributed to the shareholders of the insolvent company.

Subordinated creditors are ranked according to the terms of the subordination (and provided that such
terms do not contravene the Insolvency Act).

An insolvency practitioner of a company will generally be required to ring-fence a certain percentage
of the proceeds of enforcement of floating charge security for the benefit of unsecured creditors (after
making full provision for preferential creditors and expenses out of floating charge realizations) (the
“Prescribed Part”). This ring-fence applies to 50% of the first £10,000 of floating charge realizations
and 20% of the remainder over £10,000, with a maximum aggregate cap of £800,000 (except where the
company’s net property is available to be distributed to the holder of a first-ranking floating charge
created before 6 April 2020, in which case the maximum aggregate cap is £600,000). The Prescribed
Part must be made available to unsecured creditors unless the cost of doing so would be disproportionate
to the resulting benefit to creditors. The requirement for an administrator, liquidator or receiver
(including administrative receiver) to set aside a Prescribed Part of the company's property which is
subject to a floating charge, and make it available for unsecured creditors, will not apply to any charge
created or otherwise arising under a financial collateral arrangement (as described in the Financial
Collateral Regulations).

**_Foreign currency_**

Under English insolvency law, where creditors are asked to submit formal proofs of claim for their
debts, the office-holder will convert all foreign currency denominated proofs of debt into pound sterling
at a single rate for each currency determined by the office-holder by reference to the exchange rates
prevailing on the relevant date. This provision overrides any agreement between the parties. If a creditor
considers the rate to be unreasonable, they may apply to the court.

465


-----

Accordingly, in the event that an English Obligor goes into liquidation or administration, holders of the
Notes may be subject to exchange rate risk between the date on which such English Obligor goes into
liquidation or administration and receipt of any amounts to which such holders of the Notes may become
entitled.

**_Reviewable Transactions_**

There are five principal provisions of the Insolvency Act under which transactions entered into prior to
a company’s insolvency are capable of being set aside. They are: (i) transactions at an undervalue
(section 238); (ii) preferences (section 239); (iii) avoidance of certain floating charges (section 245);
(iv) transactions defrauding creditors (section 423); and (v) extortionate credit transactions (section
244).

These provisions all apply where the company has gone into an English liquidation or administration,
with the exception of section 423 which can be invoked even if the company is not in insolvency
proceedings.

**_Relevant Time_**

Whether a transaction at an undervalue was entered into, a preference was given or an invalid floating
charge was granted will depend in part on whether that action took place at the “relevant time.”

In the case of a preference or a transaction at an undervalue, the relevant time is deemed to be:

(a) if the preference was in favor of a connected person (other than by reason of being an
employee), and in the case of all transactions at an undervalue, the period of two years ending
with the onset of the company’s insolvency (as defined below);

(b) if the preference is not given in favor of a connected person, the period of 6 months ending with
the onset of the company’s insolvency;

(c) at a time between the making of an administration application in respect of the company and
the making of an administration order on that application; or

(d) at a time between the filing of a notice of intention to appoint an administrator and the making
of an appointment,

provided that at the time the transaction at an undervalue was entered into or the preference was given
the company was unable to pay its debts or became unable to pay its debts as a result of the transaction
at an undervalue or the transaction in respect of which the preference was given. If the transaction at an
undervalue is entered into in favor of a connected party, the company will be assumed to have been
unable to pay its debts or became unable to pay its debts as a result of the transaction.

In the case of a floating charge which is being challenged, the relevant time is deemed to be:

(a) if the floating charge is created in favor of a connected person, the period of two years ending
with the onset of the company’s insolvency (as defined below);

(b) if the charge is not created in favor of a connected person, the period of 12 months ending with
the onset of the company’s insolvency;

(c) at a time between the making of an administration application in respect of the company and
the making of an administration order on that application; or

(d) at a time between the filing of a notice of intention to appoint an administrator and the making
of an appointment,

466


-----

provided that at the time the charge was granted the company was unable to pay its debts or became
unable to pay its debts as a result of the transaction in respect of which the floating charge was granted.

**_Connected persons_**

If the given transaction at an undervalue, preference, or invalid floating charge has been entered into by
the company with a “connected person”, then particular specified time periods and presumptions will
apply to any challenge by an administrator or liquidator (as set out below).

A “connected person” of a company granting a security interest or guarantee for the purposes of
transactions at an undervalue, preferences or invalid floating charges is a party who is: (a) a director of
the company; (b) a shadow director; (c) an associate of such director or shadow director; or (d) an
associate of the relevant company.

The term “associate” is very widely defined; key “associates” are defined below.

A party is an associate of an individual if they are: (a) a relative of the individual; (b) the individual’s
husband, wife or civil partner; (c) a relative of the individual’s husband, wife or civil partner; or (d) the
husband, wife or civil partner of a relative of the individual or the individual’s husband, wife or civil
partner.

A person is an associate of any person with whom he is in partnership and of the husband, wife or civil
partner or relative of any individual with whom he is in partnership.

A party is associated with a company if they are employed by that company (and in this case directors
of a company are treated as employees of that company). A person is also an associate of any person
whom he employs. A company is an associate of another person if that person has control of it or if that
person and persons who are his associates together have control of it.

A company is associated with another company if the same person has control of both companies, or a
person has control of one and persons who are his associates, or he and persons who are his associates,
have control of the other, or if a group of two or more persons has control of each company, and the
groups either consist of the same persons or could be regarded as consisting of the same persons by
treating (in one or more cases) a member of either group as replaced by a person of whom he is an
associate.

A person is to be taken as having control of a company if the directors of the company or of another
company which has control of it (or any of them) are accustomed to act in accordance with his directions
or instructions, or he is entitled to exercise, or control the exercise of, one third or more of the voting
power at any general meeting of the company or of another company which has control of it. Where
two or more persons together satisfy either of these conditions, they are to be taken as having control
of the company.

The potential grounds for challenge available under the English insolvency legislation that may apply
to any security interest or guarantee granted by a company include, without limitation, the following
described below.

**_Transactions at an undervalue_**

If a company goes into an English administration or liquidation and it has entered into a transaction at
an undervalue, the court may, on the application of the insolvency officeholder, set the transaction aside.

A transaction will constitute a transaction at an undervalue if: (i) the transaction is at an undervalue (a
gift or a transaction on terms that provide for the company to receive no consideration or a transaction
for a consideration the value of which (in money or money’s worth) is significantly less than the value

467


-----

(in money or money’s worth) of the consideration provided by the company); (ii) the transaction took
place within the relevant time; and (iii) the company was at the time of the transaction, or became, as a
result of the transaction, unable to pay its debts within the meaning of section 123 of the Insolvency
Act. (although there is a rebuttable presumption that the company was unable to pay its debts at the
time of the transaction if the transaction is made to a connected person.

The court will not make an order in respect of a transaction at an undervalue if it is satisfied that: (i) the
company which entered into the transaction did so in good faith and for the purposes of carrying on its
business; and (ii) when it did so, there were reasonable grounds for believing that the transaction would
benefit the company. If the court determines that the transaction was a transaction at an undervalue, the
court shall make such order as it thinks fit to restore the company to the position it would have been in
had the transaction not been entered into (which may include the setting aside of any security interests
or guarantees granted). An order by the court for a transaction at an undervalue may affect the property
of, or impose any obligation on, any person whether or not he is the person with whom the company
entered into the transaction, but such an order will not prejudice any interest in property which was
acquired from a person other than the company in good faith and for value, or prejudice any interest
deriving from such an interest, and will not require a person who received a benefit from the transaction
in good faith and for value to pay a sum to the liquidator or administrator of the company, except where
that person was a party to the transaction.

**_Preferences_**

If a company goes into an English administration or liquidation and it has granted a preference the court
may, on the application of the insolvency officeholder, set the transaction aside.

A company gives a preference to a person if: (i) that person is one of the company’s creditors, a surety
or a guarantor for any of the company’s debts or other liabilities; (ii) the company has done something,
or has suffered something to be done which (in either case) has had the effect of putting that person into
a position which, in the event that the company goes into insolvent liquidation, will be better than the
position he would have been in if that thing had not been done; (iii) the company was influenced in
deciding to give the preference by a desire to put the creditor in a better position than he would have
been in if the thing had not been done or suffered to be done (this influence is rebuttably presumed if
the beneficiary of the transaction is a connected person other than solely by reason of being an employee
of the company); (iv) the preference was given within the relevant time; and (v) the company was at the
time of the transaction, or became as a result of the transaction, unable to pay its debts within the
meaning of section 123 of the Insolvency Act.

The courts have interpreted the desire to prefer on the part of the company as requiring a “positive wish
to improve the creditor’s position in the event of the company’s insolvent liquidation” (Re Fairway
Magazines Ltd [1993] BCLC 643). The courts have also held that where a company is only influenced
by “proper commercial considerations” there will be no desire to prefer and therefore no voidable
preference (Re MC Bacon Ltd (No. 1) [1990] BCLC 324).

**_Voidable floating charges_**

If a company goes into an English administration or liquidation, a floating charge created by that
company over its property may be invalid if it was created in the relevant time. Where the transaction
is with a Connected Person, this means within a period of two years before the onset of insolvency. In
all other cases, this means within a period of twelve months before the onset of insolvency when the
company was at the time of the transaction, or became as a result of the transaction, unable to pay its
debts within the meaning of section 123 of the Insolvency Act.

This is the only requirement for setting aside the floating charge and, if met, the security is automatically
invalid except to the extent of the aggregate of the value of so much of the consideration for the creation
of the charge (as consists of money paid, goods or services supplied or debts discharged and interest

468


-----

thereon) supplied to the company at the time of, or after the creation of, the charge. No court action is
required.

Section 245 of the Insolvency Act does not apply to a floating charge that has been created under a
financial collateral arrangement within the meaning of the Financial Collateral Regulations.

If a floating charge is held to be wholly invalid, then it will not be possible for the holder of that charge
to appoint an administrator out-of-court or through the less onerous in-court route for a holder of a
qualifying floating charge in respect of the company’s property or (if the holder would otherwise have
been entitled to appoint an administrative receiver but for the floating charge being held invalid), to
appoint an administrative receiver.

**_Transactions defrauding creditors_**

A transaction entered into by a company can be set aside if: (i) the transaction is at an undervalue (see
above); and (ii) it was entered into for the purpose of putting assets beyond the reach of a person who
may make a claim against the company or otherwise prejudicing his interests.

It is not necessary for the company to be in insolvency proceedings and unlike a transaction at an
undervalue or a preference, the claim is not restricted to the officeholder. This provision may be used
by any person who claims to be a “victim” of the transaction (with the leave of the court if the company
is in liquidation or administration) and is not therefore limited to liquidators or administrators and,
subject to certain conditions, the UK Financial Conduct Authority and the UK Pensions Regulator. The
Insolvency Act also does not prescribe a set time limit within which to bring the action. The fact that
the transaction was not entered into with a dishonest motive is no defense to the claim. It will suffice
that the company’s subjective purpose was to place the assets out of the reach of creditors or a particular
creditor. There is no need to show that the intention was the sole purpose and a substantial purpose is
likely to suffice.

If the court determines that the transaction was a transaction defrauding creditors, the court can make
such orders as it thinks fit to restore the position to what it would have been if the transaction had not
been entered into and to protect the interests of the victims of the transaction. The relevant court order
may affect the property of, or impose any obligation on, any person, whether or not he is the person
with whom the transaction was entered into. However, such an order will not prejudice any interest in
property which was acquired from a person other than the debtor company in good faith, for value and
without notice of the relevant circumstances, and will not require a person who received a benefit from
such transaction in good faith, for value and without notice of the relevant circumstances to pay any
sum unless such person was a party to the transaction.

**_Extortionate credit transactions_**

If a company goes into administration or liquidation and it has entered into an extortionate credit
transaction, the court may, on the application of the insolvency officeholder, set the transaction aside.

A transaction is extortionate if, having regard to the risk accepted by the person providing the credit,
either: (i) its terms require grossly exorbitant payments to be made (whether unconditionally or in
certain contingencies) in respect of the provision of the credit; or (ii) it otherwise grossly contravenes
ordinary principles of fair dealing.

The court can make an order in relation to extortionate credit transactions entered into by the company
up to three years before the day on which the company entered into administration or went into
liquidation (which is slightly different to the concept of the onset of insolvency used in relation to
transactions at an undervalue and preferences).

469


-----

**_Orders_**

In the case of any of the above applying and where a court order is required (i.e., not section 245), the
court has very wide statutory powers to make such orders as it thinks fit to restore the position to that
which existed before the transaction was entered into.

**_Onset of insolvency_**

The date of the onset of insolvency, for the purposes of transactions at an undervalue, preferences and
invalid floating charges, depends on the insolvency procedure in question.

In administration, the onset of insolvency is the date on which: (a) the court application for an
administration order is issued; (b) the notice of intention to appoint an administrator is filed at court; or
(c) otherwise, the date on which the appointment of an administrator takes effect.

In a compulsory liquidation the onset of insolvency is the date the winding-up petition is presented to
court, whereas in a voluntary liquidation it is the date the company passes a winding-up resolution.
Where liquidation follows administration, the onset of insolvency will be the same as the initial
administration.

**_Recharacterization of fixed security interests_**

There is a possibility that a court could find that any of the fixed security interests expressed to be
created by the Security Documents governed by English law properly take effect as floating charges as
the description given to them as fixed charges is not determinative. Whether the purported fixed security
interests will be upheld as fixed security interests rather than floating security interests will depend,
among other things, on whether the secured party has the requisite degree of control over the chargor’s
ability to deal in the relevant assets and the proceeds thereof and, if so, whether such control is exercised
by the security holder in practice. Where the chargor is free to deal with the assets that are the subject
of a purported fixed charge in its discretion and without the consent of the chargee, the court would be
likely to hold that the security interest in question constitutes a floating charge, notwithstanding that it
may be described as a fixed charge.

While recharacterization is a risk for all attempts to create fixed security, it is a particular risk in relation
to attempts to create fixed security over receivables. This is because even if a company purports to grant
fixed security over its receivables, it will likely retain, in practice, the ability to deal with its receivables
in its discretion and without the consent of the chargee.

If any fixed security interests are recharacterized as floating security interests, the claims of (i) any
unsecured creditors of the relevant English Obligor in respect of that part of the chargor’s net property
which is ring fenced (see explanation about ring fencing above); and (ii) certain statutorily defined
preferential creditors of the chargor may have priority over the rights of the Security Agent to the
proceeds of enforcement of such security. In addition, as mentioned above, the expenses of a liquidation
or administration would also rank ahead of the claims of the Security Agent as floating charge holder.

**_Limitation on enforcement_**

The grant of a Note Guarantee or Collateral by an English Obligor in respect of the obligations of
another group company must satisfy certain legal requirements. More specifically, such a transaction
must be allowed by the respective company’s memorandum and articles of association. To the extent
that the above do not allow such an action, there is the risk that the grant of the guarantee and the
subsequent security can be found to be void and the respective creditor’s rights unenforceable. Some
comfort may be obtained for third parties if they are dealing with an English Obligor in good faith,
however the relevant legislation is not without difficulties in its interpretation. Further, corporate benefit
must be established for each English Obligor in question by virtue of entering into the proposed

470


-----

transaction. Section 172 of the Companies Act 2006 provides that a director must act in the way that he
considers, in good faith, would be most likely to promote the success of the English Obligor for the
benefit of its members as a whole. If the directors authorise the company’s entry into a transaction
where there is no or insufficient commercial benefit, they may be found as abusing their powers as
directors and such a transaction may be vulnerable to being set aside by a court. Section 172(3) of the
Companies Act 2006 additionally provides that a director’s general duty (as described above) is subject
to any enactment or rule of law requiring directors, in certain circumstances, to consider or act in the
interests of the creditors of the company. While the statutory provisions do not specify the
circumstances in which the requirement to consider or act in the interests of the creditors of the company
arises, the UK Supreme Court has held that when an English company is insolvent or bordering on
insolvency, its directors owe a duty to the company to consider the interests of the company’s creditors
as a whole and, if an insolvent liquidation or administration is not inevitable, balance those interests
against the interests of shareholders.

Security and/or guarantees granted by an English Obligor may also be subject to potential limitations
to the extent they would result in unlawful financial assistance contrary to English company law.

**_Security over shares_**

Security over shares granted by an English Obligor or over shares of an English Obligor are, under
English law, equitable charges, not legal charges. An equitable charge arises where a chargor creates
an encumbrance over the shares in favour of the chargee and/or transfers the beneficial interest in the
shares to the chargee but retains legal title to the shares. Remedies in relation to equitable charges may
be subject to equitable remedies or are otherwise at the discretion of the court.

The validity of share security and the ability of secured parties to enforce security interests over shares
may additionally be affected by a failure of the charging company or related parties or (in certain
circumstances) the secured parties to comply within the relevant timeframes with the disclosure and
notification obligations under English company statutes in respect of persons with significant control
and relevant legal entities.

**_Security over bank accounts_**

With respect to any security over bank accounts (each an “Account Charge”) granted by an English
Obligor, the banks with which some of those accounts are held (each an “Account Bank”) may hold a
right at any time (at least prior to them being notified of a crystallization event under the Account
Charge) to exercise the rights of netting or set-off to which they are entitled under their cash pooling or
other arrangements with that English Obligor. As a result, and if the security granted over those accounts
is merely a floating (rather than fixed) charge, the collateral constituted by those bank accounts will be
subject to the relevant Account Bank’s rights to exercise netting and set-off with respect to the bank
accounts charged under the relevant Account Charge. Once the floating charge has crystallized and
converted into a fixed charge (as it would on enforcement or the occurrence of certain insolvency events
with respect to the relevant English Obligor) and the Account Bank has been formally notified of that
fact, the collateral will no longer be subject to the relevant Account Bank’s netting and set-off rights
unless the Account Bank has expressly reserved set-off rights in such circumstances.

**_Company voluntary arrangements_**

Pursuant to Part I of the Insolvency Act, a company (by its directors or its administrator or liquidator
as applicable) may propose a company voluntary arrangement to the company’s shareholders and
creditors which entails a compromise, or other arrangement, between the company and its creditors,
typically a rescheduling or reducing of the company’s debts. Provided that the proposal is approved by
the requisite majority of creditors by way of a decision procedure, it will bind all unsecured creditors
who were entitled to vote on the proposal. A company voluntary arrangement cannot affect the right of
a secured creditor to enforce its security, except with its consent.

471


-----

In order for the company voluntary arrangement proposal to be passed, it must be approved by at least
75% (by value) of the company’s creditors who respond in the decision procedure, and no more than
50% (by value) of unconnected creditors may vote against it. Secured debt cannot be voted in a company
voluntary arrangement. However, a secured creditor may vote to the extent that it is undersecured. A
secured creditor who proves in the company voluntary arrangement for the whole of its debt may be
deemed to have given up its security.

**_Scheme of arrangement_**

A scheme of arrangement is a statutory procedure, pursuant to Part 26 of the Companies Act 2006,
which permits a company to enter into an arrangement or compromise with its members or creditors (or
any class of them).

The English courts have jurisdiction to sanction a scheme of arrangement that effects a compromise of
a company’s liabilities with respect to its creditors (or any class of its creditors) where such company
(i) is liable to be wound-up under the Insolvency Act and (ii) has “sufficient connection” to the English
jurisdiction.

In practice, a non-English company is likely to satisfy the first limb of this test and the second limb has
been found to be satisfied where, amongst other things, the company’s COMI is in England, the
company’s finance documents are English law governed, or the company’s finance documents have
been amended in accordance with their terms to be governed by English law. Ultimately, each case will
be considered on its particular facts and circumstances so previous cases will not necessarily determine
whether or not any of the grounds of the second limb are satisfied in the present case.

Before the court considers the sanction of a scheme of arrangement at a hearing where the fairness and
reasonableness of the scheme of arrangement will be considered, affected creditors will vote on a
detailed debt compromise. Such compromise can be proposed by the company or its creditors. If 75%
or more by value and over 50% by number of those creditors present and voting at the creditor
meeting(s) vote in favor of the proposed compromise, irrespective of the terms and approval thresholds
contained in the finance documents, that compromise will, subject to the sanction of the court, be
binding on all affected creditors, including those affected creditors who did not participate in the vote
on the scheme of arrangement and those who voted against the scheme of arrangement. The court has
the discretion as to whether to sanction the Scheme as approved, make an order conditional upon
modifications being made or reject the Scheme. In certain circumstances, a scheme of arrangement can
also result in the release of guarantees in order to ensure the effectiveness of the compromise.

**_Restructuring Plan (Part 26A)_**

The Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020 introduced a new type of restructuring procedure
(a “Restructuring Plan”), which is available under Part 26A of the Companies Act and which is similar
to a Scheme under Part 26 of the Companies Act but with a few key differences, including an ability
for a cross-class cramdown to bind dissenting stakeholders to the proposed Restructuring Plan.

Like a Scheme, a Restructuring Plan is available to any company that is liable to be wound up under
the Insolvency Act, excluding certain financial market participants and any other company excluded by
the Secretary of State. The company must: (i) have encountered, or be likely to encounter, financial
difficulties that are affecting, or will or may affect, its ability to carry on business as a going concern;
and (ii) have proposed a compromise or arrangement with its creditors or members (or any class of
them) for the purpose of eliminating, reducing, preventing or mitigating the effect of such financial
difficulties. There is no financial eligibility criteria other than the financial difficulties test mentioned
in (i) above, thereby making the Restructuring Plan procedure available to both solvent and insolvent
companies (in the latter case, the Restructuring Plan would be proposed by the incumbent insolvency
practitioner). Where a convening application is made within 12 weeks after the end of the new
standalone moratorium, any creditors in respect of “moratorium debts” and “priority pre-moratorium

472


-----

debts” may not participate in the vote and may not be compromised under the Restructuring Plan
without their consent (see “Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020” below).

The overall Restructuring Plan process closely resembles that for a Scheme. As an initial step, the
company will seek leave of the court to convene meetings of the relevant classes of its creditors or
members (as applicable). Creditors and members whose rights against the company would be affected
by the Restructuring Plan must be permitted to participate in a convening meeting ordered by the court,
provided that this will not apply in relation to a class of creditors or members of the company if the
court is satisfied that none of the members of that class has a genuine economic interest in the company
(in other words, if that class is “out of the money” under the relevant alternative for the company if the
Restructuring Plan is not sanctioned).

At the relevant class meetings, the Restructuring Plan will be deemed approved by a class if a number
representing at least 75% in value of the class of creditors or class of members (as applicable) present
and voting vote in favor of it. In contrast to a Scheme, there is no requirement that a majority in number
must also vote in favor of the Restructuring Plan. Following the creditors’ or members’ meeting(s), a
sanction hearing will be held. Here, the court will consider if the necessary plan requirements have been
met, review the fairness of the Restructuring Plan and consider whether it is reasonable and decide
whether to sanction the Restructuring Plan. The court has discretion to sanction a Restructuring Plan,
even if one or more classes of creditors or members did not vote in favor of it, thereby “crammingdown” dissenting classes, if: (i) the court is satisfied that none of the members of the dissenting class
would be any worse off under the Restructuring Plan than they would be in the event of the “relevant
alternative” (i.e. what the court considers the most likely to occur in relation to the company if the
Restructuring Plan were not sanctioned); and (ii) the Restructuring Plan has been approved by a number
representing at least 75% in value of a class of creditors or members (as applicable), present and voting,
who would receive a payment, or have a genuine economic interest in the company, in the event of the
relevant alternative referred to in (i) above. A Restructuring Plan sanctioned by the court will be binding
on all affected parties, whether they initially voted in favor of it or not.

As with a Scheme, the commencement of a Restructuring Plan process does not automatically trigger a
moratorium of claims or proceedings.

**Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020**

On June 26, 2020, the Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020 (as amended, “CIGA”) came
into force. CIGA introduced some additional restructuring and insolvency procedures, including the
Restructuring Plan (described above).

_Moratorium_

CIGA introduced a moratorium procedure, which is available under Part A1 of the Insolvency Act to
certain legal entities (subject to exclusions in Schedule ZA1 of the Insolvency Act), including
companies registered in England, Wales or Scotland and unregistered companies liable to be wound up
under Part 5 of the Insolvency Act, subject to certain exclusions. The moratorium’s initial duration will
be for a period of 20 business days beginning with the business day after the day on which the
moratorium comes into force, but this can be extended (i) by the directors without creditor consent, for
a period of a further 20 business days, (ii) with creditor consent, for a total period of a year (including
the initial 20 business day period), and (iii) by the court, for an unlimited period.

To obtain the benefit of the moratorium, a director of the debtor must (provided that the company is not
an overseas company or already subject to a winding up petition, in which case the directors must apply
to the court for an order for the moratorium) file certain documents at court to certify that, in their view,
the debtor is or is likely to become unable to pay its debts and a licensed insolvency practitioner must
certify that, in their view, a moratorium would be likely to result in the rescue of the company as a going
concern. Despite the existence of a “payment holiday” in respect of certain pre-moratorium debts which

473


-----

exists throughout the moratorium, the company will still be expected to pay certain debts incurred while
the moratorium is in force under an obligation incurred before the moratorium commenced (known as
“priority pre-moratorium debts”), including the costs of goods and services, employees and rent,
together with all amounts falling due under loan agreements and other financial services contracts.

The moratorium is not available to a company which on the date of filing (i) is a party to an agreement
which is or forms part of a capital market arrangement, (ii) has incurred or, when the agreement was
entered into was expected to incur, a debt of at least £10 million under the arrangement (at any time
during the life of the capital market arrangement) and (iii) the arrangement involves the issue of a capital
market investment. The definitions of “capital market arrangement” and “capital market investment” in
Schedule ZA1 of the Insolvency Act are broad and are such that, in general terms, any company which
is a party to an arrangement which involves at least £10 million of debt, the granting of security to a
trustee, and the issue of a rated, listed or traded debt instrument, is excluded from being eligible for a
moratorium. The Secretary of State may modify the criteria by reference to which a company otherwise
eligible for a moratorium is excluded from being so eligible.

**Republic of Ireland**

_Insolvency_

Arachas BidCo Designated Activity Company (the “RoI Collateral Provider”) is incorporated under
the laws of Ireland (“RoI”) and has its registered offices in Ireland. Under the Recast Insolvency
Regulation, the RoI Collateral Provider’s centre of main interest (“RCOMI”) is presumed to be the
place of its registered office (i.e. Ireland) in the absence of proof to the contrary and provided that the
RoI Collateral Provider did not move its registered office within the three months prior to a request to
open insolvency proceedings.

As the RoI Collateral Provider’s COMI is presumed to be Ireland, any main insolvency proceedings in
respect of the RoI Collateral Provider would fall within the jurisdiction of the courts of Ireland. As to
what might constitute ‘‘proof to the contrary’’ regarding the location of a company’s COMI, the key
decision is that in Re Eurofood IFSC Ltd ((2004) 4 IR 370 (Irish High Court); (2006) IESC 41 (Irish
Supreme Court); (2006) Ch 508; ECJ Case C 341/04 (European Court of Justice)), given in respect of
the equivalent provision in the previous EU Insolvency Regulation (Regulation (EC) No. 1346/2000).
In that case, on a reference from the Irish Supreme Court, the European Court of Justice concluded that
‘‘factors which are both objective and ascertainable by third parties’’ would be needed to demonstrate
that a company’s actual situation is different from that which the location of its registered office is
deemed to reflect. For instance, if a company with its registered office in Ireland does not carry on any
business in Ireland, that could rebut the presumption that the company’s COMI is in Ireland. However,
if a company with its registered office in Ireland does carry on business in Ireland, the fact that its
economic choices are controlled by a parent undertaking in another jurisdiction would not, of itself, be
sufficient to rebut the presumption.

If the RoI Collateral Provider’s COMI was found to be in another EU jurisdiction (other than Denmark)
and not in Ireland, main insolvency proceedings would be opened in that jurisdiction instead.

RoI insolvency laws and other limitations could limit the enforceability of any security interests granted
by the RoI Collateral Provider.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of RoI insolvency laws and processes relating to
certain limitations on the security interests in respect of the Notes, insofar as they are provided by the
RoI Collateral Provider. The description below is only a summary, and does not purport to be complete
or to discuss all of the limitations on the security interests in respect of the Notes, insofar as they are
provided by the RoI Collateral Provider.

474


-----

The application of these laws could adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights under the the
Collateral securing the Notes and limit any amounts that you may receive. We have also analyzed the
typical forms of security interests in RoI, which are commonly created in RoI over a company’s assets,
namely fixed and floating charges.

_Fixed and floating charges_

Under RoI law, there are a number of ways in which fixed charge security has an advantage over floating
charge security: (a) an examiner appointed to the charging company can deal with floating charge assets;
(b) a fixed charge, even if created after the date of a floating charge, may have priority as against the
floating charge over the charged assets; (c) general costs and expenses (including the liquidator’s
remuneration) properly incurred in a winding-up are payable out of the company’s assets, and in certain
circumstances, in priority to floating charge claims; (d) until the floating charge security crystallizes, a
company is entitled to deal with assets that are subject to floating charge security in the ordinary course
of business, meaning that such assets can be effectively disposed of by the charging company so as to
give a third-party good title to the assets free of the floating charge and so as to give rise to the risk of
security being granted over such assets in priority to the floating charge security; (e) floating charge
security is subject to certain challenges under Irish insolvency law (See “Challenges to guarantees and
_security—Grant of floating charge”); and (f) floating charge security is subject to the claims of_
preferential creditors in a winding-up (such as certain taxes, occupational pension scheme contributions,
salaries owed to employees (subject to a cap per employee) and holiday pay owed to employees).

Under RoI law there is a possibility that a court could recharacterize fixed security interests purported
to be created by a security document as floating charges; the description given to security interests by
the parties is not determinative. Whether security interests labelled as fixed will be upheld as fixed
security interests rather than floating security interests will depend on, among other things, whether the
chargee has the requisite degree of control over the relevant chargor’s ability to deal in the relevant
assets and the proceeds thereof and, if so, whether such control is exercised by the chargee in practice.
Where the chargor is free to deal with the secured assets without the consent of the chargee prior to
crystallization, the court is likely to hold that the security interest in question constitutes a floating
charge, notwithstanding that it may be described as a fixed charge in the security documents. In addition,
to the extent that any of the assets which are expressed to be subject to a fixed charge are not specifically
identified, the court may hold that such assets are, in fact, subject to a floating charge.

_Preferred creditors under RoI Law_

Under Section 621 (Preferential Payments in a winding up) (“Section 621”) of the Companies Act 2014
(as amended, the “Companies Act”) in a winding-up of an RoI company certain preferential debts are
required to be paid in priority to all debts other than those secured by a fixed charge. Preferential debts
therefore have priority over debts secured by a floating charge. If the assets of the relevant company
available for the payment of general creditors are insufficient to pay the preferential debts, they are
required to be paid out of the property subject to the floating charge. Section 621 was amended by the
Companies (Accounting) Act 2017 (with effect from 9 June 2017) with the effect that a charge created
as a floating charge by a company will continue to rank as a floating charge on a winding up of that
company, even if that floating charge has crystallised. Under Section 440 (Preferential Payments when
receiver appointed under floating charge) of the Companies Act, the holder of a floating charge, or a
receiver appointed by such a holder, who takes possession of property subject to the floating charge
when the company is not in the course of being wound up, is required to pay the preferential debts out
of that property in priority to principal and interest secured by the floating charge. Such preferential
debts would comprise, among other things, any amounts owed in respect of local rates and certain
amounts owed to the RoI Revenue Commissioners for income/corporation/capital gains tax, value
added tax (VAT), employee related taxes, social security and pension scheme contributions and
remuneration, salaries and wages of employees and certain contractors and the expenses of liquidation.

475


-----

In addition, there is a further limited category of super preferential creditors which take priority, not
only over unsecured creditors and holders of floating security, but also over holders of fixed security.
These super preferential claims include the remuneration, costs and expenses properly incurred by any
examiner of the company which may include any borrowings made by an examiner to fund the
company’s requirements for the duration of his appointment that have been approved by the RoI courts,
(see “—Examinership” below) and any capital gains tax payable on the disposition of an asset of the
company by a liquidator, receiver or mortgagee in possession as well as, in certain circumstances,
PAYE and VAT arrears where a fixed charge over book debts is created.

Furthermore, and as referred to above (See “Fixed and Floating Charges”), in the case of the application
of moneys arising from the realization of secured assets that are subject to a floating charge, or in a
winding-up, the costs of the liquidation and the liquidator’s fees will take priority over the claims of
floating chargeholders in respect of relevant assets.

**Examinership**

Examinership is a court procedure available under the Companies Act to facilitate the survival of the
whole or part of an RoI company the whole or any part of its undertaking through the appointment of
an examiner and the formulation by the examiner of proposals for a compromise or scheme of
arrangement. In circumstances where an RoI company is or is likely to be unable to pay its debts, then
that company, the directors of that company, a contingent, prospective or actual creditor of that
company, or shareholders of that company holding, at the date of presentation of the petition, not less
than one-tenth of the paid-up voting share capital of that company are each entitled to petition the court
for the appointment of an examiner to that company. Provided the company can demonstrate its survival
(and all or part of its undertaking) as a going concern, and can satisfy certain tests, the RoI company
may be placed under the protection of the relevant Irish court (the Court) for a period of time whilst its
affairs are investigated by an independent examiner whose function is to see whether the company is
capable of being rescued and to supervise the restructuring process.

Where the relevant Irish court appoints an examiner to a company, it may, at the same or any time
thereafter, make an order appointing the examiner to be examiner for the purposes of the Companies
Act to a related company of such company. Once confirmed by the relevant Irish court the scheme is
binding on the company and all its members and creditors. During the protection period the day-to-day
business of the company remains under the control of the directors of the company, subject to certain
rights of the examiner to apply to the relevant Irish court.

Once appointed an examiner must, as soon as practical, formulate proposals for a compromise or
scheme of arrangement in relation to the company to which he has been appointed. Typically, a scheme
of arrangement will involve the writing down of creditors’ claims (both secured and unsecured,
contingent and actual) that are in existence at the date of the petition and the introduction into the
company of new funds. The examiner has the power to set aside contracts and arrangements entered
into by the company after this appointment and, in certain circumstances, can avoid a negative pledge
given by the company prior to this appointment. Furthermore, the examiner may sell assets of the
company which are the subject of security. Where such assets are the subject of a fixed security interest,
the examiner must account to the holders of the fixed security interest for the amount realized and
discharge the amount due to the holders of the fixed security interest out of the proceeds of the sale.
Having formulated his proposals, he must convene meetings of such classes of members and creditors
as he thinks proper to consider acceptance of his proposals. The examiner must report to the Court on
the outcome of his meetings within 35 days of his appointment, although the 35 day period can be
extended by the Court. There is acceptance by creditors or by a class of creditors when a majority in
number representing a majority in value of the claims represented at the meeting vote in favor of the
proposals. The proposals must be confirmed by the Court if they are to become effective and the Court
can confirm the proposals only if, inter alia: (a) a majority in number of creditors whose interests or
claims would be impaired by implementation of the proposals, representing a majority in value of the

476


-----

claims that would be impaired by implementation of the proposals, have voted to accept the proposals;
(b) if the abovementioned requirement (a) is not satisfied, then a majority of the classes of creditors
whose interests would be impaired by the scheme of arrangement have voted to accept them, provided
that, at least one of those creditor classes is a class of secured creditors or is senior to the class of
ordinary unsecured creditors; or (c) if the abovementioned requirement (b) is not satisfied, at least one
class of creditors whose interests or claims would be impaired by the proposals, other than a class which
would not receive any payment or keep any interest in liquidation, has voted to accept them; and (d) no
dissenting creditor would be worse off if the proposals are confirmed and implemented than such a
creditor would be if the normal ranking of liquidation priorities were applied, either in the event of
liquidation, whether piecemeal or by sale as a going concern, or in the event of the next-best-alternative
scenario if the proposals were not confirmed.

Once confirmed by the Court, the proposals become binding on the company and all creditors (whether
secured or unsecured) or the class or classes of creditors (whether secured or unsecured), as the case
may be, affected by the proposals and their rights are accordingly modified.

For as long as a company is under the protection of the relevant Irish court, no attachment, sequestration,
distress or execution shall be put into force against the property or effects of the relevant company
except with the consent of the examiner. Section 520 (Effect of petition to appoint examiner on creditors
_and others) of the Companies Act provides, among other things, that except with the consent of the_
examiner:

  - where any claim against the company is secured by a mortgage, charge, lien or other
encumbrance or a pledge of, on or affecting the whole or any part of the property, effects or
income of the ROI company, no action may be taken to realise the whole or any part of such
security (save in certain circumstances where the secured asset is located in another EU member
state, and the secured party has rights in rem with respect to those assets as a matter of the laws
of that member state);

  - no receiver over any part of the property or undertaking of the RoI company shall be appointed
(and if a receiver was appointed before the petition was presented, that receiver was unable to
act); and

  - no proceedings for the winding up of the company may be commenced and no resolution for
winding up of the company may be passed (and no such resolution passed shall have any effect).

In addition, pursuant to Section 521 (Restriction on payment of pre-petition debts) of the Companies
Act, no payment may be made by a company during the period of Court protection by way of
satisfaction or discharge of the whole or a part of a liability incurred by the company before the date
upon which the petition for the examiner’s appointment was presented unless the independent expert’s
report under Section 511 (Independent expert’s report) of the Companies Act that accompanied the
petition recommended that all or part of that liability be discharged or satisfied, or such payment is
authorized by the Relevant Irish court (on application of the examiner or any interested party) where
the Relevant Irish court is satisfied that a failure to discharge or satisfy in whole or in part that liability
would considerably reduce the prospects of the company or the whole or any part of its undertaking
surviving as a going concern. The Companies Act allows for the renumeration, costs and expenses of
the examiner which have been sanctioned by an order of the court (other than the expenses that, by
virtue of section 529 of the Companies Act, are treated as expenses properly incurred by the examiner)
to be paid prior to any other claims including secured claims. Section 529 of the Companies Act
provides that any liabilities incurred by a company in examinership which are certified by the examiner
which have been incurred in circumstances where, in the opinion of the examiner, the survival of the
company under court protection as a going concern during the period would otherwise be seriously
prejudiced, shall be treated as expenses properly incurred for the purposes of Section 554 of the
Companies Act but will rank behind the claims of creditors secured by a mortgage, charge, lien or other

477


-----

encumbrance of a fixed nature or a pledge. Nonetheless, if the court sanctions borrowings by an
examiner as part of the expenses of the examiner pursuant to Section 554 of the Companies Act, such
borrowings will rank ahead of the claims of both unsecured creditors and creditors secured by a floating
charge of the company under court protection.

Where an examinership petition is presented in relation to a company, that company is deemed to be
under the protection of the Court during the period beginning on presentation of the petition and ending
70 days later (which period may be extended by a further 30 days where the Court is satisfied that the
examiner would not be able to present his report within 70 days, or by such further unlimited period as
the Court may allow where the Court needs more time to consider the proposals contained in the
examiner’s final report). In the event of an appeal of the Court’s decision, the protection period is likely
to be further extended in order to allow the determination of the appeal.

Furthermore, the Court may order that an examiner shall have any of the powers of a liquidator
appointed by the Court would have, which could include the power to apply to have transactions
disclaimed if the related contract amounted to an unfair preference.

**Primary Risks for Holders of Notes in an Examinership**

The primary risks to the holders of the Notes, under the laws of Ireland, if an examiner were appointed
to the RoI Collateral Provider and/or to a company related to such an RoI company and where any
amounts due under the Notes were unpaid, are as follows: (a) there may be a delay in enforcing the
obligations of the RoI Collateral Provider in respect of the Notes and of any payment obligations
contained in a guarantee given by any other related company subject to the examinership proceedings;
(b) the potential for a compromise or scheme of arrangement being approved involving the writing
down or rescheduling of the debt due by the RoI Collateral Provider to the holders of the Notes; (c) the
potential for a compromise or scheme of arrangement being approved involving the writing down or
rescheduling of any payment obligations owed to the holders of the Notes by a company related to the
RoI Collateral Provider; (d) the potential for the examiner to seek to set aside any negative pledge
prohibiting the creation of security or the incurring of borrowings by the RoI Collateral Provider to
enable the examiner to borrow to fund the guarantor or issuer during the protection period; and (e) in
the event that a scheme of arrangement is not approved in respect of the RoI Collateral Provider and the
company subsequently goes into liquidation, the examiner’s remuneration and expenses (including
certain borrowings incurred by the examiner on behalf of the guarantor and approved by the RoI High
Court) will take priority over the moneys and liabilities which from time to time are or may become
due, owing or payable by it to the holders of the Notes.

**Challenges to Guarantees and Security**

There are circumstances under RoI insolvency law in which the granting by an RoI company of security
can be challenged. In most cases this will only arise if an examiner or a liquidator is appointed to the
RoI company within a specified period (as set out in more detail below) of the granting of the security
and, in addition, the company was ‘‘unable to pay its debts’’ when the security interest was granted or
when the guarantee was given or ‘‘unable to pay its debts’’ within the meaning of the Companies Act
as a result.

The following potential grounds for challenge may apply to security interests and guarantees:

_Unfair preference_

Under Irish insolvency law, if an ROI company goes into liquidation, a liquidator may apply to the
court to have certain transactions disclaimed if the related contract amounted to an unfair preference.
Section 604 (Unfair preference: effect of winding up on antecedent and other transactions) of the
Companies Act (“Section 604”) provides that any conveyance, mortgage, delivery of goods, payment,

478


-----

execution or other act relating to property made or done by or against a company which is unable to
pay its debts as they become due in favour of any creditor of the company or any person on trust for
any such creditor, with a view to giving such creditor (or any surety or guarantor of the debt due to such
creditor) a preference over the company’s other creditors, shall be deemed to be an unfair preference of
its creditors and be invalid accordingly if a winding up of the company commences within six months
of the doing of the act and the company is, at the date of commencement of the winding up, unable to
pay its debts (taking into account contingent and prospective liabilities). Where the creditor that has
received the preference is a “connected person”, the invalidation period is extended from six months to
two years, and there will be a rebuttable presumption under law that there was an intention to unfairly
prefer that creditor.

_Improperly transferred assets_

Under Section 608 (Power of the court to order return of assets which have been improperly transferred)
of the Companies Act (“Section 608”), if it can be shown on the application of a liquidator, creditor or
contributory of a company which is being wound up, to the satisfaction of the High Court, that any
property of that company was disposed of (including a disposal by way of charge, security assignment
or mortgage) and the effect of such a disposal was to “perpetrate a fraud” on the company, its creditors
or members, the High Court may, if it deems it just and equitable to do so, order any person who appears
to have ‘‘use, control or possession’’ of the property concerned, or of the proceeds of the sale or
development of that property, to deliver it or them, or to pay a sum in respect of it to the liquidator on
such terms as the High Court sees fit. The ability to use Section 608 to challenge the transfer of assets
has been extended to receivers and examiners. Section 608 does not apply to a disposal that would
constitute an unfair preference for the purposes of Section 604.

_Disclaimer of onerous contracts_

Under Section 615 (Disclaimer of onerous property in case of company being wound up) of the
Companies Act, the liquidator of a company may, by the giving of notice, disclaim any onerous property
of the company. “Onerous property” is defined to include any “unprofitable contract” and “any other
property (of the company) which is unsaleable or not readily saleable by reason of its binding the
possessor of it to the performance of any onerous act or to the payment of any sum of money.”

_Grant of floating charge_

Under Section 597 (Circumstances in which floating charge is invalid) of the Companies Act, a floating
charge is invalid if created in the period of twelve months (or two years if created in favour of a
“connected person”) ending with the date of commencement of the winding up of the company, and
unless it can be proven that the company was solvent immediately after the creation of the charge. Such
invalidity does not apply to money actually advanced or paid or the actual price or value of goods or
services sold or supplied to the company at the time or after the creation of, and in consideration for,
the charge together with interest at the appropriate rate.

**General**

If the RoI Collateral Provider becomes subject to an RoI law insolvency proceeding and that company
has obligations to creditors that are treated under RoI law as senior relative to the company’s obligations
to the holders of the Notes, the holders of the Notes may suffer losses as a result of their subordinated
status during such insolvency proceeding.

The validity and enforceability of a security interest may be contested on the basis that it is prohibited
under the relevant company’s constitution. To the extent that the constitution does not allow such an
action, there is the risk that the grant of the guarantees may be found to be void and unenforceable.
Further, guarantees or covenants to pay in security documents by an Irish company for the obligations

479


-----

of another group company must be in the commercial interest and for the corporate benefit of the Irish
company. If the granting of any security interest is not for the Irish company’s corporate benefit, the
security interest could be held null and void. The question of corporate benefit is determined on a caseby-case basis and consideration has to be given to any direct and/or indirect benefit that the company
would actually derive from the transaction and is particularly relevant for upstream or cross-stream
guarantees or security. The question whether or not the corporate benefit requirement is met is a matter
of fact, which must be assessed by the competent body of the company being the board of directors of
the company acting bona fide in the interest of the company. If the corporate benefit requirement is not
met, the directors of the company may be held liable by the company for negligence in the management
of the company. Moreover, the security interests could be declared null and void. The validity and/or
enforceability of the security interests may also be subject to the statutes of limitations, defences such
as set-off or counterclaim, the doctrine of frustration and the doctrine of estoppel, and the fact that
equitable remedies will only be granted by the Irish court in its discretion.

Subject to certain exceptions, under Section 82 (Financial assistance for acquisition of shares) of the
Companies Act (‘‘Section 82’’), it is unlawful for a RoI company to give, whether directly or indirectly,
and whether by means of a loan, guarantee, the provision of security or otherwise, any financial
assistance for the purpose of a purchase or subscription made or to be made by any person or for any
shares in the company or its holding company. As a result, the Notes may only be secured by the relevant
ROI company to the extent that it would not result in such security constituting the giving of unlawful
financial assistance under Section 82.

Pursuant to Section 1001 of the RoI Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, the holder of a fixed security over
book debts of an RoI tax resident company may be required by notice from the RoI Revenue
Commissioners to pay to them sums equivalent to those which the holder thereafter receives in payment
of debts due to it by the relevant company. Where the holder of the security has informed the RoI
Revenue Commissioners of the creation of the security within 21 days of its creation (or within 21 days
of the transfer of the security to the holder) the holder’s liability is limited to the amount of certain
outstanding RoI tax liabilities of the company (including liabilities in respect of value added tax) arising
after the issue to the holder of a notice from the RoI Revenue Commissioners.

The RoI Revenue Commissioners may also attach any debt due to an RoI tax resident company by
another person in order to discharge any liabilities of the company in respect of outstanding tax whether
the liabilities are due on its own account or as an agent or trustee. It is possible that the scope of this
right of the RoI Revenue Commissioners may override the rights of holders of security (whether fixed
or floating) over the debt in question.

**Jersey**

Two of the providers of Collateral are companies incorporated under the laws of Jersey (the “Jersey
**Obligors”). Consequently, in the event of an insolvency of either Jersey Obligor, insolvency**
proceedings may be initiated in Jersey. There are two principal regimes for corporate insolvency in
Jersey: “désastre” and winding up (including just and equitable winding up and creditors’ winding up).
Under Jersey law, if a liquidator were to be appointed to either Jersey Obligor or if either Jersey Obligor
was declared to be “en désastre,” the liquidator or the Jersey Viscount (as defined below), as the case
may be, has the power to investigate past transactions entered into by that entity and may in certain
circumstances seek various court orders, including orders to void certain transactions entered into prior
to the winding-up of such company and for the repayment of money. These transactions are generally
known as “voidable transactions” or “vulnerable transactions” and the main ones are generally
described below together with a summary of the principal insolvency regimes in Jersey and certain
other relevant matters.

In Jersey, a guarantee may be set aside or held not to be enforceable on a number of grounds, including
grounds that relate to corporate benefit, fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preferences,

480


-----

transactions at an undervalue or similar laws and regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors
generally.

The principal type of insolvency procedure available to creditors under Jersey law is the application for
an Act of the Royal Court of Jersey (the “Royal Court”) under the Bankruptcy (Désastre) (Jersey) Law
1990, as amended (the “Jersey Bankruptcy Law”) declaring the property of a debtor to be “en
désastre” (a “declaration”).

On a declaration of désastre, title and possession of the property of the debtor vest automatically in the
Jersey Viscount, an official of the Royal Court (the “Jersey Viscount”). With effect from the date of
declaration, an unsecured creditor has no other remedy against the property or person of the debtor, and
may not commence or, except with the consent of the Jersey Viscount or the Royal Court, continue any
legal proceedings to recover the debt but may prove in the désastre. With effect from the date of
declaration, a secured party may, however, without the consent of the Jersey Viscount and without an
order of the court, exercise any power of enforcement it may have under Part 7 (Enforcement of Security
Interests) of the Security Interests (Jersey) Law 2012 (the “2012 Law”). To the extent that the proceeds
of such enforcement are insufficient to discharge liabilities owed, that secured party has no other remedy
against the property or person of the debtor, and may not commence any legal proceedings or, except
with the consent of the Jersey Viscount or the Royal Court, continue any legal proceedings to recover
the balance of the debt.

Additionally, the creditors or shareholders of a Jersey company can instigate a winding up of an
insolvent company, which is known as a “creditors’ winding up” pursuant to Chapter 4 of Part 21 of
the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991, as amended (the “Companies Law”). On a creditors’ winding up
commenced by shareholders, a liquidator is nominated by the shareholders. The creditors may approve
such a liquidator or apply to appoint a different liquidator. The liquidator will stand in the shoes of the
directors and administer the winding up, gather assets, make appropriate disposals of assets, settle
claims and distribute assets as appropriate. On a creditors' winding up commenced by application to
court by a creditor, the court may appoint a provisional liquidator any time after the application. At the
hearing of the application, if a winding up order is made, the court may appoint a person nominated by
the creditor or selected by the court to be liquidator. If a liquidator is appointed by the court, any
creditor of the company may within seven days of the creditors' meeting apply to court for someone
else to be appointed liquidator instead of the liquidator appointed by the court. The liquidator stands in
the shoes of the directors and administers the winding up, gathers assets, makes appropriate disposals
of assets, settles claims and distributes assets as appropriate. After the appointment of a provisional
liquidator or the commencement of the winding up (whether commenced by shareholders or court
order), no action can be taken or proceeded with against the company except with the leave of the Royal
Court. In a creditors' winding up commenced by shareholders, the company must give creditors 14 days’
notice of the shareholders meeting to commence the creditors’ winding up and give notice of a creditors
meeting to be held immediately after the shareholders meeting. A creditor who applies to wind up the
company must give the company at least 48 hours' notice that the application is being made. If the court
orders a creditors' winding up or appoints a provisional liquidator, the liquidator must, within seven
days of the liquidator's appointment, give creditors of the company notice calling a creditors meeting to
be held in Jersey 21 days after the date of the court order. After the commencement of the creditors’
winding up, a secured party may, however, without the sanction of a liquidator and without an order of
the court, exercise any power of enforcement it may have under Part 7 (Enforcement of Security
Interests) of the 2012 Law. To the extent that the proceeds of such enforcement are insufficient to
discharge liabilities owed, the secured party has no other remedy against the company without leave of
the Royal Court. The corporate state and capacity of the company continues until the end of the winding
up procedure, when the company is dissolved. The Companies Law requires a creditor of a company
(subject to appeal) to be bound by an arrangement entered into by the company and its creditors
immediately before or in the course of its winding up if (inter alia) three quarters in number and value
of the creditors acceded to the arrangement.

481

**Transactions at an undervalue**

Under Article 17 of the Jersey Bankruptcy Law and Article 176 of the Companies Law, the Royal Court
may, on the application of the Jersey Viscount (in the case of a company whose property has been
declared “en désastre”) or liquidator (in the case of a creditors’ winding up, a procedure which is
instigated by shareholders not creditors), set aside a transaction (including any guarantee or security
interest) entered into by a company with any person (the “other party”) at an undervalue. There is a
five year look back period from the date of commencement of the winding up or declaration of
“désastre” during which transactions are susceptible to examination pursuant to this rule (the “relevant
time”). The Jersey Bankruptcy Law and Companies Law contain detailed provisions, including (without
limitation) those that define what constitutes a transaction at an undervalue, the operation of the relevant
time and the effect of entering into such a transaction with a person connected with the company or
with an associate of the company.

If the Royal Court determines that the transaction was a transaction at an undervalue, the Royal Court
can make such order as it thinks fit to restore the position to what it would have been in if the transaction
had not been entered into. In any proceedings, it is for the Jersey Viscount or liquidator to demonstrate
that the Jersey company was insolvent unless a beneficiary of the transaction was a connected person
or associate of the company, in which case there is a presumption of insolvency and the connected
person must demonstrate the Jersey company was not insolvent when it entered the transaction in such
proceedings or that it did not become insolvent as a result of the transaction.

**Preferences**

Under Article 17A of the Jersey Bankruptcy Law and Article 176A of the Companies Law, the Royal
Court may, on the application of the Jersey Viscount (in the case of a company whose property has been
declared “en désastre”) or liquidator (in the case of a creditors’ winding up), set aside a preference
(including any guarantee or security interest) given by the company to any person (the “other party”).
There is a 12 month look back period from the date of commencement of the winding up or declaration
of “désastre” during which transactions are susceptible to examination pursuant to this rule (the
“relevant time”). The Jersey Bankruptcy Law and Companies Law contain detailed provisions,
including (without limitation) those that define what constitutes a preference, the operation of the
relevant time and the effect of entering into a preference with a person connected with the company or
with an associate of the company.

A transaction will constitute a preference if it has the effect of putting a creditor of the Jersey company
(or a surety or guarantor for any of the company’s debts or liabilities) in a better position (in the event
of the company going into an insolvent winding up) than such creditor, guarantor or surety would
otherwise have been in had that transaction not been entered into. If the Royal Court determines that
the transaction constituted such a preference, it has very wide powers for restoring the position to what
it would have been if that preference had not been given (although there is protection for a third party
who enters into one of the transactions in good faith and without notice). However, for the Royal Court
to do so, it must be shown that in deciding to give the preference the Jersey company was influenced
by a desire to produce the preferential effect. In any proceedings, it is for the Jersey Viscount or
liquidator to demonstrate that the Jersey company was insolvent at the relevant time and that the
company was influenced by a desire to produce the preferential effect, unless the beneficiary of the
transaction was a connected person, in which case there is a presumption that the company was
influenced by a desire to produce the preferential effect and the connected person must demonstrate in
such proceedings that the company was not influenced by such a desire.

**Extortionate credit transactions**

Under Article 17C of the Jersey Bankruptcy Law and Article 179 of the Companies Law, the Royal
Court may, on the application of the Jersey Viscount (in the case of a company whose property has been
declared “en désastre”) or liquidator (in the case of a creditors’ winding up), set aside a transaction

482


-----

providing credit to the debtor company which is or was extortionate. There is a three year look back
period from the date of commencement of the winding up or declaration of “désastre” during which
transactions are susceptible to examination pursuant to this rule. The Jersey Bankruptcy Law and
Companies Law contain detailed provisions, including (without limitation) those that define what
constitutes a transaction which is extortionate.

**Disclaimer of onerous property**

Under Article 15 of the Jersey Bankruptcy Law, the Jersey Viscount may within six months following
the date of the declaration of désastre and under Article 171 of the Companies Law, a liquidator may
within six months following the commencement of a creditors’ winding up, disclaim any onerous
property of the company. “Onerous property” is defined to include any moveable property, a contract
lease or other immoveable property if it is situated outside of Jersey that is unsaleable or not readily
saleable or is such that it might give rise to a liability to pay money or perform any other onerous act,
and includes an unprofitable contract. A disclaimer operates to determine, as of the date it is made, the
“rights, interests and liabilities of the company/debtor in or in respect of the property disclaimed and
discharges the company/Jersey Viscount from all liability in respect of the property as of the date of the
commencement of the creditors’ winding up/from the date of the declaration in or in respect of the
property disclaimed” but “does not, except so far as is necessary for the purpose of releasing the
company/debtor from liability, affect the rights or liabilities of any other person.” A person sustaining
loss or damage as a result of a disclaimer is deemed to be a creditor of the company to the extent of the
loss or damage and shall have standing as a creditor in the désastre or creditors’ winding up. The Jersey
Bankruptcy Law and Companies Law contain detailed provisions, including (without limitation) in
relation to the power to disclaim onerous property.

**Fraudulent Dispositions**

In addition to the Jersey statutory provisions referred to above, there are certain principles of Jersey
customary law under which dispositions of assets with the intention of defeating creditors’ claims may
be set aside.

**Enforcement of security and security in insolvency**

Under the laws of Jersey, a person incorporated, resident or domiciled in Jersey is deemed to have
capacity to grant security governed by foreign law over property situated outside Jersey, but to the
extent that any floating charge or other security interest governed by a foreign law is expressed to apply
to any asset, property and undertaking of a person incorporated, resident or domiciled in Jersey such
floating charge or other security interest is not likely to be held valid and enforceable by the Jersey
courts in respect of Jersey situs assets.

The Insolvency Act 1986 (either as originally enacted or as amended, including by the provisions of the
Enterprise Act 2002) does not apply in Jersey and receivers, administrative receivers and administrators
are not part of the laws of Jersey. Accordingly, the Royal Court may not recognize the powers of an
administrator, administrative receiver or other receiver appointed in respect of Jersey situs assets.

The Royal Court (in its inherent jurisdiction) may, however, under Article 49(1) of the Jersey
Bankruptcy Law assist the courts of prescribed countries and territories and, applying general principles
of comity, assist the courts in other jurisdictions, in all matters relating to the insolvency of any person
to the extent that the Royal Court think fit. Further, in doing so, the Royal Court may have regard to the
UNCITRAL model law, even though the model law has not been (and is unlikely to be) implemented
as a separate law in Jersey.

If insolvency proceedings have been commenced in another jurisdiction in relation to the company, the
nature and extent of the cooperation from Jersey is likely to depend on the nature of the requesting
country’s insolvency regime.

483


-----

In the case of both statutory and non-statutory requests for assistance, it should be noted that the
UNCITRAL provisions will not automatically be followed as this is a matter for the discretion of the
Royal Court. The court’s position may also not be in accordance with the EU Insolvency Regulation.
Jersey does not form part of the European Community for the purposes of implementation of its
directions. Accordingly, the EU Insolvency Regulation does not apply as a matter of Jersey domestic
law and the automatic test of centre of main interests does not apply.

Enforcement of a security interest against a Jersey company may be further limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, liquidation, dissolution, re-organization or other laws of general application relating to or
affecting the rights of creditors, and laws in relation to transactions at an undervalue, preferences,
extortionate credit transactions, disclaimer of onerous property and fraudulent dispositions also apply
in Jersey.

Under Jersey law, security over Jersey situs assets is created in accordance with the provisions of Jersey
law. The Jersey situs assets of the Jersey Obligors will be secured pursuant to Jersey law governed
security interest agreements. The 2012 Law provides that a secured party may enforce security over
intangible movable assets by way of sale or appropriation of the collateral or proceeds. In addition, a
secured party may take certain ancillary actions, including any bespoke enforcement powers included
in a security agreement, to the extent not in conflict with the 2012 Law. More than one enforcement
option can be taken, and taking one or more of the enforcement options specified above does not
preclude the exercise of other rights of a secured party. The power of enforcement is exercisable once
an event of default has occurred and written notice specifying the event of default has been served on
the grantor by the secured party. If enforcement is by way of sale or appropriation, the secured party
must give the grantor 14 days’ prior written notice. Importantly, the grantor may agree in writing to
waive its right to notice of appropriation or sale and it is usual to include such a waiver in the security
agreement. The secured party is obliged on sale or appropriation, to give at least 14 days’ prior written
notice to: (i) any person who, 21 days before the sale or appropriation, has a registered security interest
in the collateral; and (ii) any person other than the grantor who has an interest in the collateral and has,
not less than 21 days before the sale or appropriation, given the secured party notice of that interest
unless, in each case, the secured party and such person have otherwise agreed in writing. There are
specific carve-outs from the obligation to give notice of sale. On exercising the power of enforcement
by appropriation or sale, the secured party must: (i) take all commercially reasonable steps to determine
or, in the case of a sale, obtain the fair market value of the collateral, as at the time of the relevant
appropriation or sale; (ii) act in a commercially reasonable manner in relation to the appropriation or
sale; and (iii) (in the case of a sale only) enter into any agreement for or in relation to the sale only on
commercially reasonable terms. The duty of the secured party is owed to the grantor and also to any
other person to whom the secured party was required to give notice of sale or appropriation (whether or
not they have agreed in writing to waive the notice requirements). If, in exercising its powers of
enforcement, a secured party appropriates or sells collateral, it must, within 14 days after the day on
which the collateral is appropriated or sold, give certain persons (being the grantor (subject to it having
waived this requirement), any person with a registered subordinate security interest and certain persons
claiming an interest in the collateral) a written statement of account setting out certain information in
relation to that appropriation or sale. If a secured party has sold or appropriated the collateral and the
net value or proceeds of appropriation or sale (as appropriate) of the collateral exceeds the amount of
the debt owed to the secured party, the secured party shall pay the amount of any resulting surplus in
the following order: (i) in payment, in due order of priority, to any person who has a subordinate security
interest in the collateral and has registered a financing statement over that security interest (where the
registration remained effective immediately before the appropriation or sale); (ii) in payment to any
other person (other than the grantor) who has given the secured party notice that that person claims an
interest in the collateral and in respect of which the secured party is satisfied that that person has a
legally enforceable interest in the collateral; and (iii) as to the balance (if any) in payment to the relevant
debtor grantor. Alternatively, the secured party may discharge its obligation above with respect to any
surplus by paying that amount into the Royal Court. The surplus may then only be paid out on the order
of the court on application by a person entitled to the surplus.

484

**Guarantee Waivers**

If the Royal Court was asked to enforce a guarantee against a Jersey company, the Jersey company
might be able to claim certain rights under Jersey law, known as the droit de division and the droit de
discussion, being respectively essentially the right to require that any liability of that company under a
guarantee be divided or apportioned with another person or persons and a right to require that the assets
of the principal obligor or any other person be exhausted before any claim under the guarantee is
enforced against the Jersey company. These guarantor rights can be waived by contract.

**European Union**

One of the New SFA Borrowers will be incorporated under Dutch law (the “Dutch Guarantor”) and
the RoI Collateral Provider is incorporated under Irish law; each is therefore existing under the laws of
a member state of the European Union (each member state of the European Union, a “Member State”).

Pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of May 20, 2015
on insolvency proceedings (recast), replacing Council Regulation (EC) No. 1346/2000 of May 29, 2000
on insolvency proceedings, as amended (as amended from time to time, the “EU Insolvency
Regulation”), the court which shall have jurisdiction to commence the main insolvency proceedings in
relation to a company (subject to certain exceptions) incorporated under the laws of a Member State is
the court of the Member State (other than Denmark) in which the relevant company’s “center of main
interests” (as that term is used in Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, “COMI”) is situated.
The determination of where any such company has its COMI is a question of fact on which the courts
of the different Member States may have different and even conflicting views.

COMI is not a static concept. There is however a rebuttable presumption under Article 3(1) of the EU
Insolvency Regulation that any such company has its COMI in the Member State in which it has its
registered office. Recital 28 of the EU Insolvency Regulation states that the COMI of a debtor should
correspond to the place where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis
and which “is ascertainable by third parties.” In that respect, factors such as where board meetings are
held, the location where the company conducts the majority of its business and the location where the
large majority of the Company’s creditors are established may all be relevant in the determination of
the place where the company has its COMI. A company’s COMI may change from time to time but is
determined for the purposes of deciding which courts have competent jurisdiction to commence
insolvency proceedings pursuant to the EU Insolvency Regulation at the time of the filing of the
insolvency petition. The presumption described above shall however only apply if the registered office
has not been moved to another Member State within the three-month period prior to the request for the
opening of insolvency proceedings (as defined in Article (3) of the EU Insolvency Regulation). Based
on a recent decision by the European Court of Justice, the court of a Member State with which a request
to open main insolvency proceedings has been lodged retains exclusive jurisdiction to open such
proceedings where the center of the debtor’s main interests is moved to another Member State after that
request has been lodged, but before that court has delivered a decision on it.

If the COMI of a company is and will remain located in a Member State, the main insolvency
proceedings in respect of the company under the EU Insolvency Regulation would be commenced in
such jurisdiction and accordingly a court in such jurisdiction would be entitled to commence the types
of insolvency proceedings referred to in Annex A to the EU Insolvency Regulation. Main insolvency
proceedings opened in one Member State under the EU Insolvency Regulation are automatically
recognized in the other Member States (other than Denmark), although secondary proceedings may be
initiated in another Member State in the event that the company has an “establishment” (within the
meaning and as defined in Article 2(10) of the EU Insolvency Regulation) in the territory of such other
Member State. An “establishment” is defined to mean “any place of operations where a debtor carries
on non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets.”

485


-----

Secondary proceedings are limited to winding-up proceedings and the effects of such secondary
proceedings are restricted to the assets of the company situated in the territory of such other Member
State.

Where main proceedings in the Member State in which the debtor has its COMI have not yet been
commenced, pursuant to Article 3 (4) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, territorial insolvency
proceedings may only be commenced in another Member State where the debtor has an establishment
where either (i) insolvency proceedings cannot be commenced in the Member State in which the
debtor’s COMI is situated under that Member State’s law or (ii) the opening of territorial insolvency
proceedings is requested by (a) a creditor whose claim arises from or is in connection with the operation
of an establishment situated within the territory of the Member State where the opening of territorial
proceedings is requested, or (b) a public authority that has the right to request the opening of insolvency
proceedings under the law of the Member State in which the establishment is located. The effects of
“territorial proceedings” shall be restricted to the assets of the debtor situated in the territory of the
Member State where such proceedings are opened. When main insolvency proceedings are opened,
territorial insolvency proceedings become secondary insolvency proceedings. Irrespective of whether
the insolvency proceedings are main or secondary or territorial insolvency proceedings, such
proceedings will, subject to certain exceptions, be governed by the lex fori concursus, i.e., the local
insolvency law of the court that has assumed jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings of the debtor.
Furthermore, pursuant to Article 6 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of the Member State
within the territory of which insolvency proceedings have been opened in accordance with its Article 3
shall have jurisdiction for any action that derives directly from the insolvency proceedings and is closely
linked with them, such as avoidance actions.

The opening of insolvency proceedings in a Member State pursuant to Article 8 of the EU Insolvency
Regulation shall not affect the rights in rem of creditors or third parties in respect of tangible or
intangible, moveable or immoveable assets, both specific assets and collections of indefinite assets as a
whole that change from time to time, belonging to the debtor that are situated within the territory of
another Member State at the time of the opening of proceedings. Rights in rem include:

- the right to dispose of assets or have them disposed of and to obtain satisfaction from the
proceeds of or income from those assets, in particular by virtue of a lien or a mortgage;

- the exclusive right to have a claim met, in particular a right guaranteed by a lien in respect of
the claim or by assignment of the claim by way of a guarantee;

- the right to demand assets from, and/or to require restitution by, anyone having possession or
use of them contrary to the wishes of the party so entitled;

- a right in rem to the beneficial use of assets.

The courts of all Member States (other than Denmark) must recognize the judgment of the court
commencing main proceedings that will be given the same effect in the other Member States so long as
no secondary proceedings have been commenced there.

Pursuant to Article 21 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the insolvency practitioner appointed by the
court of the main proceedings may exercise the powers conferred on him by the law of the Member
State in which the main proceedings are located in another Member State as long as no insolvency
proceedings have been opened in such other Member State or any preservation measure to the contrary
has been taken there further to a request to open insolvency proceedings in such other Member State.
He may, in particular, subject to the preservation of third parties’ right in rem pursuant to Article 8 of
the EU Insolvency Regulation and to the preservation of the sellers’ rights based on a reservation of
title pursuant to Article 10 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, remove assets of the company from that
other Member State.

486


-----

Under Article 36 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency
proceedings may attempt to avoid the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings in another Member
State by giving a unilateral undertaking in respect of the assets located in the Member State in which
secondary insolvency proceedings could be opened that the distribution of those assets or of the
proceeds received as a result of their realization, will comply with the distribution and priority rights
that would apply under the relevant national law if secondary insolvency proceedings were opened in
such other Member State. Such undertaking must be made in writing and is subject to approval by a
qualified majority of known local creditors, determined in accordance with the local law of such other
Member State. If approved, the undertaking is binding on the insolvency estate and if a court is
requested to open secondary insolvency proceedings, it shall, at the request of the insolvency
practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, refuse to open such proceedings if it is satisfied that
the undertaking adequately protects the general interests of local creditors.

Additionally, under Article 38 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, where a temporary stay of individual
enforcement proceedings has been granted in order to allow for negotiations between a company and
its creditors, the court, at the request of the company or of the insolvency practitioner in the main
insolvency proceedings, may stay the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings for a period not
exceeding three months, provided that suitable measures are in place to protect the interests of local
creditors.

Under Article 46 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the court that opened the secondary insolvency
proceedings will also stay the process of realization of assets in whole or in part upon receipt of a request
from the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, for a period of up to three months,
unless such a request is manifestly of no interest to the creditors in the main insolvency proceedings.
Such stay may be continued or renewed for similar periods. Where the court stays the process of
realization of the assets, the court may require the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency
proceedings to take any suitable measure to guarantee the interests of the creditors in the secondary
insolvency proceedings and of individual classes of creditors.

In addition, the EU Insolvency Regulation has created a treatment for groups of companies experiencing
difficulties by the comment of group coordination proceedings and the appointment of an insolvency
practitioner in order to facilitate the effective administration of the insolvency proceedings of the
group’s members.

**_EU Directive on preventive restructuring frameworks_**

The EU Directive 2019/1023 of the European Parliament and the Council of June 20, 2019 on
preventive restructuring frameworks, on discharge of debt and disqualifications, and on measures to
increase the efficiency of procedures concerning restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt, and
amending Directive (EU) 2017/1132 (Directive on restructuring and insolvency) (the “EU
Restructuring Directive”) was published on June 26, 2019.

The objectives of the EU Restructuring Directive are to ensure that (i) viable enterprises and
entrepreneurs that are in financial difficulties have access to effective national preventive restructuring
frameworks that enable them to continue operating, (ii) honest insolvent or over-indebted entrepreneurs
(i.e. individuals) can benefit from a full discharge of debt after a reasonable period of time, thereby
affording them a second chance and (iii) the effectiveness of procedures concerning restructuring,
insolvency and discharge of debt is improved, in particular with a view to shortening their length.

The Restructuring Directive aims to achieve a higher degree of harmonization in the field of
restructuring, insolvency, discharge of debt and disqualifications by establishing substantive minimum
standards for preventive restructuring procedures as well as for procedures leading to a discharge of
debt for entrepreneurs in order to promote a culture that encourages early preventive restructuring to
address financial difficulties at an early stage, when it appears likely that insolvency can be prevented

487


-----

and the viability of the business can be ensured. Most notably, the Restructuring Directive provides for
a framework pursuant to which (a) a stay of individual enforcement actions by creditors against debtors
must be introduced by Member States national legislation, (b) all creditor claims shall be grouped into
separate classes each of which shall reflect a commonality of interests (at a minimum, creditors of
secured and unsecured claims shall be treated in separate classes), (c) creditor claims may be
restructured in a restructuring plan by majority vote with a majority of not more than 75% of the amount
of the claims in each class and, where the Member State so requires, a majority in number of affected
parties in each class and (d) a cross-class cram-down is introduced whereby a restructuring plan may,
under certain conditions, be adopted and bind dissenting creditors even if the creditors of one or more
classes do not consent to the restructuring plan with the required majority. In order to be adopted the
plan will have to be confirmed by a judicial or administrative authority that will in particular ensure the
protection of each type of creditors’ rights and compliance with the priority rules governing the adoption
of the plan. The transposition of the Restructuring Directive into national legislation shall protect new
financing and interim financing and may also provide priority ranking to new or interim financing
granted in the context of the restructuring.

The EU Restructuring Directive shall be transposed into national laws or regulations by Member States
by July 17, 2021 (with the exception of the provisions relating to the use of electronic means of
communication for which the time period for the transposition expires in certain respects on July 17,
2024 or, in others, on July 17, 2026), subject to a maximum 1 year extension of the transposition period
for Member States encountering particular difficulties in implementing the EU Restructuring Directive.

**_Final Remarks_**

In the event that the Dutch Guarantor or the RoI Collateral Provider experiences financial difficulty, it
is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar
proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. Applicable laws may affect the
enforceability of the obligations and the security of the Dutch Guarantor and/or the RoI Collateral
Provider. The insolvency, administration and other laws of the jurisdictions in which the respective
companies are organized or operate may be materially different from, or conflict with, each other and
there is no assurance as to how the insolvency laws of the potentially involved jurisdictions will be
applied in relation to one another.

**The Netherlands**

**_Dutch Insolvency Law_**

The Dutch Guarantor is incorporated in The Netherlands. It is therefore presumed its center of main
interest for the purpose of the EU Insolvency Regulation is located in The Netherlands. Accordingly,
any insolvency proceeding concerning the Dutch Guarantor would likely be based on Dutch insolvency
law under the EU Insolvency Regulation. Under certain circumstances, bankruptcy proceedings may
also be opened in The Netherlands in accordance with Dutch law over the assets of companies that are
not incorporated or organized under Dutch law.

Dutch insolvency laws differ significantly from insolvency proceedings in the U.S. and other
jurisdictions and may make it more difficult to recover amounts one would normally expect to recover
in a liquidation or bankruptcy proceeding in the U.S. or another jurisdiction. There are circumstances
under Dutch insolvency law in which the granting by a Dutch company of security and guarantees can
be challenged.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of Dutch insolvency law. There are three primary
insolvency regimes under Dutch law: the first, moratorium of payments (surseance van betaling), is
intended to facilitate the reorganization of a debtor’s indebtedness and enable the debtor to continue as
a going concern. The second, the Dutch scheme, allows a debtor to offer a composition outside of formal
insolvency proceedings such as suspension of payments or bankruptcy. The third, bankruptcy

488


-----

(faillissement), is primarily designed to liquidate assets and distribute the proceeds of the assets of a
debtor to its creditors. All insolvency regimes are set forth in the Dutch Bankruptcy Act
(Faillissementswet). In practice, a suspension of payments often results in bankruptcy. A general
description of the principles of the three insolvency regimes is set out below.

_Suspension of Payments_

An application for a moratorium of payments can only be made by the debtor itself, if it foresees that it
will be unable to continue to pay its payable debts. Once the request for a moratorium of payments is
filed, a court will immediately (dadelijk) grant a provisional moratorium and appoint one or more
administrators (bewindvoerders). A meeting of creditors is required to decide on the definitive
moratorium. If a draft composition (ontwerpakkoord) is filed simultaneously with the application for a
moratorium of payments, the court can order that the composition will be processed before a decision
about a definitive moratorium.

If the composition is accepted and subsequently ratified by the court (gehomologeerd), the provisional
moratorium ends. The definitive moratorium will generally be granted unless a qualified minority (more
than one quarter of the amount of claims held by creditors represented at the creditors’ meeting or more
than one third of the number of creditors represented at such creditors’ meeting) of the unsecured non
preferential creditors withholds its consent. The granting of a definitive moratorium can also be
withheld if there is a valid fear that the debtor will try to prejudice the creditors during a moratorium of
payments or if there is no prospect that the debtor will be able to satisfy its creditors in the (near) future.
A suspension of payments takes effect retroactively from 0.00 hours on the day on which the court has
granted the provisional suspension of payments.

The moratorium of payments is only effective with regard to unsecured non preferential creditors.
Unlike Chapter 11 proceedings under U.S. bankruptcy law, during which both secured and unsecured
creditors are generally barred from seeking to recover on their claims during a moratorium of payments,
under Dutch law secured and preferential creditors (including tax and social security authorities) may
enforce their rights against assets of the company in moratorium of payments to satisfy their claims as
if there were no moratorium of payments. A recovery under Dutch law could, therefore, involve a sale
of assets that does not reflect the going concern value of the debtor. However, at the request of an
interested party the court can order a “cooling down period” (afkoelingsperiode) for a maximum period
of two months (which can be extended by the court once for another period of two months) during
which enforcement actions by secured or preferential creditors are barred. Also in a definitive
moratorium of payments and a bankruptcy, a composition (akkoord) may be offered to creditors. A
composition will be binding for all unsecured and non-preferential creditors if it is approved by (i) a
simple majority of the number of creditors represented at the creditors’ meeting, representing at least
50% in amount of the claims that are acknowledged and admitted in the moratorium, and (ii)
subsequently ratified (gehomologeerd) by the court. Consequently, Dutch insolvency law could
preclude or inhibit the ability of the noteholders to effect a restructuring and could reduce the recovery
of a holder of Notes in a Dutch moratorium of payments proceeding. Interest payments that fall due
after the date on which a moratorium of payments is granted, cannot be claimed in a composition.

Under Dutch law, as soon as a definitive suspension of payments is granted or the composition is ratified
by a court, in principle, all pending executions of judgments against the relevant debtor, as well as all
attachments on the debtor’s assets (other than with respect of secured creditors and certain other
creditors, as described above), will be suspended or cancelled by operation of law.

**_Dutch Scheme_**

As regards the pre-insolvency plan regime, as of January 1, 2021, debtors have the possibility to offer
a composition outside of formal insolvency proceedings (Onderhands akkoord) under the Dutch
Bankruptcy Act. Unlike a moratorium and in bankruptcy, a composition can be offered to secured

489


-----

creditors as well as shareholders or any number of them. A composition may provide, inter alia, for
cross class cramdown, the restructuring of group company obligations through either one or more
aligned proceedings, the termination of onerous contracts with deactivation of _ipso facto_ default
provisions, and supporting court measures. Such composition may result in claims against the Issuer
and the Dutch guarantors as compromised if the relevant majority of creditors within a class or a more
senior class vote in favor of such a composition. A composition plan can extend to claims against
entities that are not incorporated or organized under Dutch law and/or are residing outside The
Netherlands. Accordingly, a composition under the Dutch Bankruptcy Act can affect the rights of
noteholders. Jurisdiction of the Dutch courts under the Dutch Bankruptcy Act may extend to entities
incorporated or residing outside The Netherlands on the basis that there is a connection with the
jurisdiction of The Netherlands.

Under the Dutch Bankruptcy Act voting on a composition plan is done in classes. Approval by a class
requires a decision adopted with a majority of two third of the claims of that class that have voted on
the plan or, in the case of a class of shareholders, two thirds of the shares of that class that have voted
on the plan. A composition may provide for the possibility for a composition plan to be binding on a
non-consenting class (cross class cramdown). The court will confirm a composition plan if at least one
class of creditors (other than a class of shareholders) that can be expected to receive a distribution in
case of a bankruptcy of the debtor approves the plan, unless there is a statutory ground for refusal. The
court can, inter alia, refuse confirmation of a composition plan on the basis of (i) a request by an affected
creditor of a consenting class if the value of the distribution that such creditor receives under the plan
is lower than the distribution it can be expected to receive in case of a bankruptcy of the debtor or (ii) a
request of an affected creditor of a non-consenting class, if the plan provides for a distribution of value
that deviates from the statutory or contractual ranking and priority to the detriment of that class. There
is one mandatory refusal ground specifically applicable to secured financial creditors. If the composition
plan entails a debt-for-equity swap to which such creditors do not want to ascribe, and these creditors
do not have the right to opt for a different kind of distribution, the court will refuse confirmation of such
plan on the request of such creditor.

Under the Dutch Bankruptcy Act, the court may grant a stay on enforcement of a maximum of four
months, with a possible extension of four months. During such period, inter alia, all enforcement action
against the assets of (or in the possession of) the debtor is suspended, including action to enforce
security over the assets of the debtor. Accordingly, during such stay a pledgee of claims may not collect
nor notify the debtors of such pledged claims of its rights of pledge.

**_Bankruptcy_**

Under Dutch law, a debtor can be declared bankrupt when it has ceased to pay its debts. The bankruptcy
can be requested by a creditor of a claim when there is at least one other creditor. At least one of the
aforementioned claims (of the bankruptcy requesting creditor or the other creditor) needs to be due and
payable. The debtor can also request the application of bankruptcy proceedings itself. Furthermore, the
Public Prosecution Service (het Openbaar Ministerie) can request the application of bankruptcy
proceedings for reasons of public interest (openbaar belang). There is no legal duty for a debtor to file
for its own bankruptcy. However, if the managing board of a company realizes that the company is or
will be unable to pay its debts when they come due, it is required to take appropriate measures, which
could include the cessation of trading, notification of creditors and the filing for either bankruptcy or a
suspension of payments (see above).

As a result of a bankruptcy, the debtor loses all rights to administer and dispose of its assets. A
bankruptcy order takes effect retroactively from 0.00 hours on the day the order is rendered.

During a Dutch bankruptcy proceeding, the assets of a debtor are generally liquidated and the proceeds
distributed to the debtor’s creditors in accordance with the respective rank and priority of their claims.
The general principle of Dutch insolvency law is the paritas creditorum (principle of equal treatment),

490


-----

which means that all creditors have an equal right to payment and that the proceeds of bankruptcy
proceedings shall be distributed in proportion to the size of their respective claims. However, certain
creditors (such as secured creditors and tax and social security authorities) will have special rights that
take priority over the rights of other creditors. Consequently, Dutch insolvency laws could reduce your
potential recovery in a Dutch bankruptcy proceeding.

The claim of a creditor may be limited depending on the date the claim becomes due and payable in
accordance with its terms. Generally, claims of the noteholders that were not due and payable by their
terms on the date of a bankruptcy of the Issuer or the relevant guarantor incorporated or organized under
Dutch law will be accelerated and become due and payable as of that date. Each of these claims will
have to be submitted to the bankruptcy receiver (curator) to be verified. “Verification” under Dutch
law means that the receiver determines the value of the claim and whether and to what extent it will be
admitted in the bankruptcy of the company for the purpose of the distribution of the proceeds. The
valuation of claims that otherwise would not have been payable at the time of the bankruptcy proceeding
may be based on a net present value analysis. Interest payments that fall due after the date of the
bankruptcy cannot be verified, unless secured by a pledge or mortgage, in which case interest will be
admitted pro memoria. The existence, value and ranking of any claims submitted by the noteholders
may be challenged in the Dutch bankruptcy proceeding. Generally, in a creditors’ meeting
(verificatievergadering), the bankruptcy receiver, the insolvent debtor and all verified creditors may
dispute the verification of claims of other creditors. Creditors whose claims or value thereof are disputed
in the creditors’ meeting may be referred to separate court proceedings (renvooiprocedure). These
procedures could cause noteholders to recover less than the principal amount of their Notes or less than
they could recover in a U.S. liquidation proceeding. Such _renvooi proceedings could also cause_
payments to the noteholders to be delayed compared with holders of undisputed claims. As in
moratorium of payments proceedings, in the bankruptcy of a company a composition (akkoord) may be
offered to creditors, which shall be binding on unsecured non preferential creditors if it is approved by
(i) a simple majority in number of the creditors represented at the creditors’ meeting, representing at
least 50% in amount of the claims that are acknowledged and conditionally admitted, and (ii)
subsequently ratified (gehomologeerd) by the court. Remaining proceeds, if any, after satisfaction of
the secured and the preferential creditors are distributed among the unsecured non preferential creditors,
who will be satisfied on a pro rata basis. Contractual subordination may to a certain extent be given
effect in Dutch insolvency proceedings. The actual effect depends largely on the way such subordination
is construed. In exceptional circumstances, a compulsory plan of composition may limit the contractual
subordination.

Secured creditors may enforce their rights against assets of the debtor to satisfy their claims under a
Dutch bankruptcy as if there is no bankruptcy. As in moratorium of payments proceedings the
supervisory judge (rechtercommissaris) can order a “cooling down period” for a maximum of two
months (which can be extended once for another period of two months) during which enforcement
actions by secured creditors are barred unless such creditors have obtained leave for enforcement from
the supervisory judge. Furthermore, a bankruptcy receiver can force a secured creditor to enforce its
security interest within a reasonable period of time, failing which the receiver will be entitled to sell the
secured assets, if any, and the secured creditor will have to share in the general costs of the bankruptcy,
which can be significant. Excess proceeds of enforcement must be returned to the bankruptcy estate;
they may not be set off against an unsecured claim of the secured creditor in the bankruptcy. An
exception applies in the case of set off relating to a payment to the pledgor, not made during its
bankruptcy and if there are no other pledgees or other holders of limited rights other than the pledgee,
although a set off prior to bankruptcy may be subject to clawback in the case of fraudulent conveyance
or bad faith in obtaining the claim used for set off. Moreover, to the extent that Dutch law applies, a
legal act performed by a debtor (including, without limitation, an agreement pursuant to which it
guarantees the performance of the obligations of a third party or agrees to provide or provides security
for any of its or a third party’s obligations, enters into additional agreements benefiting from existing
security and any other legal act having a similar effect) can be challenged in an insolvency proceeding

491


-----

or otherwise and may be nullified by any of its creditors or its trustee in bankruptcy. See below “—
_Fraudulent Transfer.”_

Under Dutch law, as soon as a debtor is declared bankrupt, in principle, all pending executions of
judgments against such debtor, as well as all attachments on the debtor’s assets (other than with respect
to secured creditors and certain other creditors, as described above), will be terminated by operation of
law. Simultaneously with the opening of the bankruptcy, a bankruptcy receiver will be appointed. The
proceeds resulting from the liquidation of the bankruptcy estate may not be sufficient to satisfy
unsecured creditors under the guarantees granted by an insolvent guarantor after the secured and the
preferential creditors have been satisfied. In principle, litigation pending on the date of the bankruptcy
order is automatically stayed.

**_Limitations on Enforcement_**

If a Dutch private limited liability company or public limited liability company grants a guarantee or
security interest and that guarantee or security interest is not in the company’s corporate interest, the
guarantee or security interest may be nullified by the relevant Dutch company, its bankruptcy receiver
(curator) in bankruptcy (faillissement) and its administrator (bewindvoerder) in moratorium of payment
proceedings (surseance _van_ _betaling) or otherwise and, as a consequence, not be valid, binding and_
enforceable against it. In determining whether the granting of a guarantee or security interest is in the
interest of a Dutch company, Dutch courts would not only consider the text of the objects clause in the
articles of association (statuten) of the company but all relevant circumstances, including (i) whether
the company irrespective of the wording of the objects clause derives certain commercial benefits from
the transaction in respect of which the guarantee or security interest was granted and (ii) the balance
between the risk that the company is assuming and the benefit it derives from such transaction. In
addition, if it is determined that there are no, or insufficient, commercial benefits from the transactions
for the company that grants the guarantee, then such company (and any bankruptcy receiver) may
challenge the enforcement of the guarantee or security interest, and it is possible that such challenge
would be successful. Such benefit may, according to Dutch case law, consist of an indirect benefit
derived by the company as a consequence of the interdependence of such company with the group of
companies to which it belongs. In addition, it is relevant whether, as a consequence of the granting of
the guarantee or security interest, the continuity of such company would foreseeably be endangered by
the granting of such guarantee or security interest. It remains possible that even if such strong financial
and commercial interdependence exists, the transaction may be declared void if it appears that the
granting of the guarantee or security interest cannot serve the realization of the relevant company’s
objects or where it is determined that there is a material imbalance to the disadvantage of the company
between the commercial benefit on the one hand and the risks on the other hand. The above also applies
with respect to any security interest granted or other legal act entered into by a Dutch company.

If Dutch law applies, a guarantee or security governed by Dutch law may be voided by a court, if the
document was executed through undue influence (misbruik van omstandigheden), fraud (bedrog),
duress (bedreiging) or mistake (dwaling) of a party to the agreement contained in that document.
Payment pursuant to a guarantee or following enforcement or foreclosure of security granted may,
regardless of an insolvency situation occurring or not, also be withheld due to unforeseen circumstances
(onvoorziene omstandigheden), force majeure (niet toerekenbare tekortkoming) or reasonableness and
fairness (redelijkheid en billijkheid). Other impeding factors include dissolution (ontbinding) of contract
and set off (verrekening).

In addition, a guarantee issued by a Dutch company and a security interest provided by a Dutch
company may be suspended (schorsen) by the Enterprise Chamber of the Court of Appeal in Amsterdam
(Ondernemingskamer van het Gerechtshof te Amsterdam) on the motion of the holder or holders of 10%
or more of the shares in such company, as well as on the motion of a trade union and of other entities
entitled thereto in the articles of association of the relevant Dutch company. Likewise, the guarantee or

492


-----

security itself may be upheld by the Enterprise Chamber, yet actual payment under it may be suspended
or avoided.

According to Dutch case law, a director (bestuurder) of a company acts wrongfully against a creditor
of the company if he has entered into commitments on behalf of that company, while he knew or
reasonably ought to understand that the company would not, or not within a reasonable period of time,
be able to meet its obligations and would not provide sufficient opportunity for recourse for the
detriment that the creditor would suffer on the basis thereof. The foregoing is subject to any
circumstances raised by the director on the basis of which the conclusion is justified that he personally
cannot be blamed sufficiently (voldoende ernstig verwijt) for the detriment suffered.

**Australia**

One of the New SFA Borrowers will be incorporated under the laws of Australia (the “Australian
**Guarantor”). Australian insolvency laws will be relevant upon the insolvency of this entity and the**
application of these laws may affect the enforcement of, and the ability to recover funds under, the Note
Guarantee given by the Australian Guarantor.

The primary source of regulation for corporate insolvency in Australia is the Corporations Act, the
_Corporations Regulations 2001 (Cth) (Regulations), the_ _Federal Court (Corporations) Rules 2000_
(Cth) and similar rules, which are in force in the Supreme Court of each State and Territory of Australia.

There are four main forms of formal insolvency processes in Australia: voluntary administration, deed
of company arrangement, receivership and winding-up (also called liquidation). Corporate
reorganizations can also be effected by schemes of arrangement (which can be a solvent or insolvent
procedure) or, in the case of small companies, by a restructuring process under Part 5.3B of the
Corporations Act, in circumstances where the company the subject of the corporate reorganization has
liabilities (excluding employee entitlements) of less than A$1 million.

**_Voluntary administration_**

Voluntary administration is a non-terminal insolvency process begun by the appointment of one or more
administrators to a company, during which the administrator investigates the company’s affairs and
recommends to its creditors whether it should enter into a Deed of Company Arrangement approved by
its creditors, be wound up or revert to normal operation by its directors.

The most common method for appointment of an administrator is for the company’s board to resolve
that in the opinion of the directors voting for the resolution, the company is insolvent, or is likely to
become insolvent at some future time and that an administrator should be appointed. A creditor with a
security interest over the whole, or substantially the whole, of the company’s property can also appoint
an administrator, as can a liquidator or provisional liquidator (if the company is already in liquidation
or provisional liquidation). A company need not be presently insolvent to enter into voluntary
administration, however in the case of an appointment by the company’s board or a liquidator or
provisional liquidator, the appointer must believe that the company is likely to become insolvent at
some future time. A creditor with a security interest over the whole, or substantially the whole, of the
company’s property, may only appoint an administrator if that security interest has become, and
remains, enforceable.

Voluntary administration is a procedure designed to salvage insolvent or near-insolvent companies so
that the company can return to trading or provide a better return for creditors and shareholders. It is the
only formal process in Australia with rehabilitation as one of its express goals. The objects of Part 5.3A
of the Corporations Act (which deals with voluntary administration) are set out in section 435A as
follows:

493


-----

The object of this part is to provide for the business, property and affairs of an insolvent company to be
administered in a way that:

- maximizes the chances of the company or as much as possible of its business, continuing in
existence; or

- if it is not possible for the company or its business to continue in existence—results in a better
return for the company’s creditors and members than would result from an immediate winding
up of the company.

The duration of voluntary administration is prescribed in the Corporations Act and is intended to provide
for a short period of administration, although the administrator can seek a short adjournment from
creditors of the company or a direction from an Australian court to lengthen the period of the
administration where the circumstances justify that course. During the period of voluntary
administration, the administrator controls the company (the powers of the directors and officers are
suspended). The administrator is free to carry on the business of the company and does so as the
company’s agent.

During the period of voluntary administration, there is a moratorium on claims by the company’s
creditors, such that (with certain exceptions) no proceedings against the company, or in relation to the
company’s property, can be commenced or continued with, and no enforcement processes can begin or
proceed other than with, the consent of the administrator or the court. Similarly, a secured creditor
cannot enforce their security interest over the property of the company except with the consent of the
administrator or the court, unless the secured creditor holds a security interest over the whole or
substantially the whole of the company’s property and enforces the security interest in relation to all
property subject to the security interest within 13 business days following the appointment of the
administrator.

During a voluntary administration, the voluntary administrator must convene at least two meetings of
creditors. At the second creditors’ meeting, creditors will be asked to vote on whether the company
should execute a Deed of Company Arrangement if one is proposed (see below), be wound up (see
below) or revert to the control of its directors. That decision is made by the company’s creditors (by a
majority in number and value) at a meeting convened by the administrator. If the vote is split between
value and number, the administrator, which generally chairs the meeting of creditors has a casting vote
on the outcome. The voluntary administration ends when the company executes a Deed of Company
Arrangement or the creditors resolve that it be wound up or revert to the control of its directors.

**_Deed of Company Arrangement_**

A Deed of Company Arrangement is a deed, which binds the deed administrators, company, its officers,
its members, its unsecured creditors (whether or not they voted in favor of it) and its secured creditors
(who voted in favor of it). Secured creditors who do not vote in favor of the deed of company
arrangement will generally not be bound by its terms.

The content of a Deed of Company Arrangement will depend on the proposal, which is put to vote at
the second creditors’ meeting held during the voluntary administration procedure. A Deed of Company
Arrangement will generally provide for the restructure or rehabilitation of the company usually by
compromising claims against the company in exchange for a distribution to creditors. There are few
restrictions under Australian law on the content of a Deed of Company Arrangement—a Deed of
Company Arrangement may provide for the realization of assets, the orderly winding down of the
company’s business, the pursuit of litigation for the benefit of creditors, and/or the compromise of
claims against the company. It will often also provide for a moratorium on claims against the company
for the period during which the Deed of Company Arrangement operates.

494


-----

A Deed of Company Arrangement can be terminated in accordance with its terms, by an order of an
Australian court, or in certain circumstances by resolution of the company’s creditors. The
consequences of termination will depend on the terms of the deed, orders made by a Court (if
applicable), or the particulars of any resolution put to creditors. Two common consequences of
termination are:

- that the company is wound up (for example, if the deed has not been performed, the Court
makes orders terminating the deed or the creditors pass a resolution terminating the deed and
that the company be wound up); or

- that the company returns to the control of its directors and officers (if the deed has been
performed).

**_Receivership_**

Receivership is a form of non-terminal insolvency process, under which a receiver (or receiver and
manager) is appointed in respect of a company to take control of or get in specific property, so as to
protect the rights of a party (usually a secured creditor) entitled to that property. Receivers are usually
appointed privately by a secured creditor in accordance with the terms of a security document. In certain
limited circumstances, receivers may also be appointed by a court on application of a party seeking to
protect its interests.

A receivership can occur concurrently with a voluntary administration, Deed of Company Arrangement
or a winding up. Where a receivership occurs concurrently with a voluntary administration, the
administrator’s powers are subject to the functions and powers of the receiver. Where a receivership
occurs concurrently with a winding up (or liquidation), the receiver’s powers are not diminished,
although there may be some restrictions on the extent to which the receiver may exercise those powers,
including due to a subsequent liquidation terminating the receiver’s agency of the company.

The manner of a receiver’s appointment will depend on the terms of the charge or security document
under which the receiver is appointed. Depending on the extent of the assets securing the company’s
obligation and the terms of the charge, the secured creditor will usually have the ability to appoint either
a receiver or a receiver and manager. A receiver is charged with the realization or management of the
secured asset over which he or she has been appointed. A receiver and manager is empowered to take
control of the debtor’s business as a going concern for the purpose of repayment of the secured debt,
either through realization of the debtor’s assets or through the income generated by the debtor’s
business. For the purposes of this offering memorandum, there is no distinction between receivers and
receivers and managers, so the term “receivers” is used to describe both types of appointment.

A receiver’s powers are determined by the terms of the security under which she or he is appointed and
certain laws (including the Corporations Act), but will generally be very broad and will usually include
the power to enter into possession and control of the secured property, lease or sell the property, and,
in the case of a receiver and manager, to carry on the business of the debtor and do all things, which the
debtor is normally empowered to do. In carrying on the business of the debtor the receiver generally
acts as agent of the company.

A receiver owes its primary duty to the secured creditor who appointed them. The Corporations Act
also imposes certain statutory duties on a receiver in the conduct of its administration of the debtor’s
assets. Of primary importance within these duties is that imposed by 420A of the Corporations Act,
which obliges receivers to take reasonable care to ensure that, if sold, the secured assets are sold for
market value or, if there is no market value, for the best price reasonably obtainable in the
circumstances. Receivers are also officers of the company and therefore, are subject to the officers’
duties imposed by the Corporations Act and the law generally.

495


-----

While the directors and officers of the debtor are not formally displaced by the appointment of a receiver
or receiver and manager, the powers of the receiver supersede those of the existing company
management and will usually result in the directors and officers being left without an active role in
relation to the secured property (which can include the entire operation of the company). The directors
are generally required to provide the receiver with reports as to the company’s affairs and to cooperate
with the receiver to the extent necessary to achieve the purposes of the receivership.

In the normal course, a privately-appointed receivership will terminate where the purpose for which the
receiver was appointed has been achieved. This will usually be the repayment of the debt owed to the
secured creditor. If there are insufficient assets held by the debtor to repay the secured debt in full, the
receivership will terminate when the receiver exhausts all of the available assets of the debtor pursuant
to which the receiver is appointed and retires.

On termination of the receivership (assuming there is not also a voluntary administration or winding up
process on foot), control of the debtor and all of its remaining assets (if any) are returned to the debtor’s
directors and officers.

**_Winding up_**

A winding-up (or liquidation) is a terminal insolvency process by which a company’s affairs are brought
to an end, and its assets are distributed among its creditors and (if there is a surplus after creditors are
paid) its members.

A winding up most commonly occurs where a company is insolvent, and is commenced:

- where a court makes an order that the company be wound up in insolvency (or for some other
reason);

- by resolution of the company’s members (known as a creditors’ voluntary winding up if the
company is insolvent); or

- by resolution of the company’s creditors at the second creditors’ meeting in a voluntary
administration.

It is also possible for a company to be wound up on a solvent basis, most commonly because its members
wish it to cease trading and have their capital returned (known as a members’ voluntary winding up).

During a winding up (subject to contrary order of the court):

- individual claimants are stayed from litigating their claims in court and instead must lodge a
proof of debt with the liquidator—in order to achieve this, a stay is imposed to prevent the
assets of the company being wasted by litigation;

- the leave of a court must be obtained in order to bring or continue proceedings against a
company, or in relation to the property of the company; and

- enforcement processes in relation to the property of the company cannot be begun or continued
against a company, although a secured creditor does not require the leave of the court to deal
with the property the subject of a security interest.

During liquidation, unsecured creditors have a right to vote at any creditors’ meetings and are entitled
to participate in the distribution of a fund of assets protected and properly administered. Secured
creditors generally retain the right to enforce their security and may elect to appoint a receiver. Where
a receivership and liquidation occur concurrently, a liquidator will generally not have power to deal
with the company’s assets that are the subject of a valid security interest in favor of the secured creditor.

496


-----

Once appointed, a liquidator is able to bring proceedings, among other things, against persons in relation
to “voidable transactions,” pursuant to section 588FE(1) of the Corporations Act. The most commonly
prosecuted “voidable transaction” claims, and their relevance to holders of Notes, are discussed further
in the limitations section below. The proceeds of successful claims will be available for distribution to
the company’s creditors.

After collecting the assets and finalization of the process of calling for proofs of debt and adjudicating
those proofs by the liquidator (and the time for receipt of proofs of debt having expired), the liquidator
can pay a dividend to creditors. Depending upon the complexity and size of the company, liquidation
can last for several years and the liquidator may declare several interim dividends over that time. Section
556(1) of the Corporations Act provides a prescribed order (commonly referred to as a “waterfall”) for
the payment of unsecured debts and claims against the company, which in summary is as follows:

- secured creditors (although certain employee priority and other priority expenses may be paid
in priority to secured creditors with a circulating security interest in respect of circulating assets
such as inventory); then

- expenses of the winding-up (including the fees and expenses of the liquidator and any prior
voluntary administrator or deed administrator); then

- unpaid wages, unpaid superannuation contributions, and other priority employee entitlements
(persons who advance funds to pay those claims have the priorities for those payments, which
the employees otherwise enjoy); then

- the claims of ordinary unsecured creditors; then finally

- the claims of shareholders.

In the case of winding-up, the final step to be taken in the process is the deregistration of the company.
The steps for deregistration are governed by the Corporations Act and once deregistered the company
ceases to exist and the liquidator’s role comes to an end.

On January 1, 2021, a simplified liquidation process for small companies with liabilities less than $1
million was introduced in Australia. The aim of the process is to streamline a liquidation by, among
other things, reducing regulatory and creditor reporting requirements, reducing rights of liquidators to
clawback unfair preference payments from unrelated creditors and removing creditors meetings and
other creditor rights available in a general liquidation.

**_Scheme of arrangement_**

A scheme of arrangement is a court approved compromise or arrangement between a company and its
creditors or members. Schemes can be utilized by companies to provide for a modification or adjustment
of the rights of the company’s creditors or members, which, if approved, will be binding on all creditors
or members.

In brief, there are two different types of schemes: members’ schemes and creditors’ schemes. Before
either type of scheme can be implemented it must be approved by the court, ASIC and the members or
creditors of the company.

A members’ scheme will inevitably involve some restructuring of the company and the rights and
obligations of its members. Once approved, the scheme will be binding on all members (including
dissenting members).

A creditors’ scheme will often involve a proposal to defer, compromise or extinguish the company’s
debts—a typical scenario would involve a moratorium in respect of claims against the company and a

497


-----

compromise of debts owed by it (and/or a modification of the rights of creditors or a class of them in
relation to the company). Once approved, the scheme will be binding on all creditors (including
dissenting creditors). A creditors’ scheme needs to be approved by each class of affected creditors (in
each case by a voting majority constituting 75% in value and majority in number). Unlike a deed of
company arrangement, schemes of arrangement can bind secured creditors and owners and lessors in
respect of their property and can release third party claims.

Schemes are extremely flexible and can be utilized to implement any arrangement relating to the rights
and obligations of the company and its creditors, save that a scheme, which is contrary to law, or not in
the public interest, is unlikely to be approved by the court (even if it has the support of members and/or
creditors).

**_Restructuring process under Part 5.3B of the Corporations Act_**

A restructuring process under Part 5.3B of the Corporations Act is a process for companies with
liabilities (excluding employee entitlements) of less than A$1 million. It is intended to be used by
companies, which are small-to-medium enterprises, and is intended to enable those companies to retain
control of their businesses while developing a restructuring plan for approval by creditors.

Part 5.3B was introduced by the Corporations Amendment (Corporate Insolvency Reforms) Act 2020
(Cth) with effect from January 1, 2021. The company the subject of the restructure generally retains
control of the conduct of the company’s business, property and affairs during the restructuring process.
A restructuring practitioner is appointed to advise the company on the restructuring process, assist in
the preparation of a restructuring plan, and make certain declarations to creditors in relation to the
restructuring plan proposed to creditors. Similar moratoria on enforcement and other action, which can
be taken by creditors and other third parties generally apply in relation to a restructuring process under
Part 5.3B of the Corporations Act, as apply under a voluntary administration. A restructuring proposal
devised by the company is required to be put to creditors. If a majority in value of creditors accept the
restructuring plan, it will bind the company and its unsecured creditors and, in certain circumstances,
its secured creditors.

**_Summary of limitations on the validity and enforceability of Note Guarantee and security interests_**
**_provided by Australian Guarantor under Australian law_**

_General_

Under Australian law, the enforceability of the Note Guarantee and security interests provided by the
Australian Guarantor is subject to various limitations, some of which are summarized below.

_Breach of Directors’ Duties_

The decision to provide the Note Guarantee and/or security interests by the Australian Guarantor may
be found to have been in breach of the duties owed by the directors of the Australian Guarantor,
including the duty to act in good faith in the best interests of the Australian Guarantor, and for a proper
purpose.

If a Court were to find that the directors of the Australian Guarantor breached those duties in connection
with providing the Note Guarantee and/or security interests it provided, in certain circumstances, they
may become voidable.

If the Note Guarantee from the Australian Guarantor is avoided, it is possible that holders of Notes
would be left with a claim solely against the Issuer and the other Guarantors.

_Personal Properties Securities Act 2009 (Cth)_

498


-----

In Australia, the _Personal Properties Securities Act 2009 (Cth) (the “PPSA”) establishes a national_
system for the registration of security interests, a system of priority and other provisions, which will
affect most collateral classes (described as “personal property” under the PPSA) other than interests in
land, fixtures attached to land, statutory licenses and general law liens. Perfection of security interests
granted by an Australian entity or granted by any entity over assets located in Australia, which (in each
case) are deemed “personal property” for the purposes of the PPSA (“Australian PPSA Collateral”)
is achieved through registration on a central register established under the PPSA and known as the
Personal Property Securities Register (the “PPSR”), or the secured party having possession or control
of Australian PPSA Collateral. Among other things, security interests perfected by control over certain
financial assets (for example bank accounts held with an authorized deposit taking institution, shares
and letters of credit), subject to limited exceptions, would rank in priority over prior registered secured
interests (like those of the holders of Notes) regardless of notice. In certain circumstances, purchasers
and lessees of Australian PPSA Collateral can acquire it free of a security interest even when they had
notice of that security interest.

Generally, where a security interest over personal property is granted by means of a security agreement,
then (unless perfection occurs by possession or control), a failure to register that security interest on the
PPSR within the first to occur of 20 business days after signing of the security agreement and the
company entering into insolvency or, if later, at least six months before the commencement of a
winding-up or administration of the grantor of that security interest, will result in that security interest
vesting in the grantor, such that the secured party’s interest will in effect no longer exist and will not be
enforceable. Also, the secured creditor’s priority may be adversely affected, as perfected security
interests generally take priority over unperfected security interests and third parties leasing or taking
transfer of the collateral will generally take free of all unperfected security interests.

_Risks Arising in a Winding-Up_

_Voidable transactions_

If the Australian Guarantor is subject to a winding up, the liquidator may apply to an Australian Court
for orders that the entry into the Note Guarantee and/or security interests by the Australian Guarantor
or a transaction in connection with the Note Guarantee and/or security interests by the Australian
Guarantor constitutes a voidable transaction and should be set aside.

The most commonly brought voidable transactions claims include the following:

- an “unfair preference,” (sections 588FA and 588FC of the Corporations Act) being a
transaction between the company and a creditor carried out at a time when the company was
insolvent (or the company became insolvent as a result of the transaction) that results in the
creditor receiving from the company, in respect of an unsecured debt, more than the creditor
would receive on a winding up of the company if the transaction were set aside;

- an “uncommercial transaction,” (sections 588FB and 588FC of the Corporations Act) being a
transaction carried on at a time the company was insolvent (or the company became insolvent
as a result of the transaction) that a reasonable person in the company’s position would not
have entered into, having regard to the benefits and detriment to the company of entering into
the transaction, the benefits to the other parties to the transaction of entering into it and any
other relevant matters;

- an “unreasonable director-related transaction” or an “unfair loan” (sections 588FDA and
588FD, respectively, of the Corporations Act); or

- a “creditor-defeating disposition,” (section 588FDB of the Corporations Act) being a
disposition of property of a company where (a) the consideration payable to the company was
less than the lesser of (i) the market value of the property and (ii) the best price reasonably

499


-----

obtainable, and (b) the disposition has the effect of preventing the property from becoming
available for the benefit of the company’s creditors in a winding-up or hindering, or
significantly delaying, the process of making the property so available.

_Green security_

A security interest granted by the company in respect of “circulating assets” in the 6 month period
leading up to the liquidator’s appointment or, if the liquidation was preceded by voluntary
administration then the commencement of the voluntary administration, will be void except so far as
the security interest secures:

  - a new advance (other than an advance to discharge an unsecured debt owed to the secured party
which must be given as consideration for the circulating security interest);

  - interest on such an advance;

  - the amount of a liability (e.g. under a guarantee) undertaken at or after that time on behalf of,
or for the benefit of, the company; or

  - an amount payable for property services supplied to the company at or after that time or interest
on an amount so payable.

The security interest will not be void if the company is proven to have been solvent immediately after
the time it granted the security interest.

_Impact of the above on entry by the Australian Guarantor into the Note Guarantee and/or security_
_interests_

The extent to which the entry into the Note Guarantee and/or security interests by the Australian
Guarantor is susceptible to challenge on the bases set out above depends, among other things, on when
the relevant transaction was entered into relative to the commencement of the winding up (or, if a
voluntary administration precedes the winding up, the commencement of the voluntary administration).

Different time periods apply depending on the circumstances of the relevant transaction and the identity
of the parties to it.

_Ipso facto reforms_

On September 18, 2017, the Treasury Laws Amendment (2017 Enterprise Incentives No. 2) Act 2017
(“TLA Act”) was enacted in Australia. With effect from July 1, 2018, this legislation introduced new
provisions into the Corporations Act, which provide for an automatic stay on the enforcement of certain
rights and self-executing provisions (known as “ipso facto” rights) arising under certain contracts (such
as a right entitling a creditor to terminate the contract or to accelerate payments or providing for
automatic acceleration) (“Automatic Stay”), if the reason for the enforcement of those rights or
provisions is:

(a) the contractual counterparty being under administration, having a managing controller or
receiver appointed over the whole or substantially the whole of its property, or announcing,
applying for or being the subject of a scheme of arrangement (for the purpose of it avoiding
being wound up in insolvency), or being under a restructuring process under Part 5.3B of the
Corporations Act;

(b) the contractual counterparty’s financial position during any of those affected procedures; or

(c) a reason that is in substance contrary to the TLA Act (known as “prescribed reasons”).

500


-----

Notably, the procedures under which the Automatic Stay would apply do not include being subject to
winding up or liquidation (unless those processes are consequent to a voluntary administration or a
scheme) or where a deed of company arrangement has been executed (unless the deed administrators
are able to obtain a court order for a stay to operate) or the restructuring process under Part 5.3B ends.
Relevantly, the Automatic Stay does not apply to other types of contractual defaults – for example, if
the company has failed to meet its payment or other performance obligations under the relevant
agreement.

The length of the Automatic Stay depends on which formal insolvency process applies to the company,
as follows (subject to courts order extending the stay):

- in the case of a scheme of arrangement: the stay will end within three months of the
announcement, or where an application is made within that three months, when the application
is withdrawn or dismissed by the court or when the scheme ends or the company is would up;

- in the case of a receivership or managing controllership: the stay will end when the receiver’s
or managing controller’s control ends; and

- in the case of a voluntary administration: the stay will end on the latest of when the
administration ends or the company is would up.

The scope of the Automatic Stay, specifically what contract types, rights and self-executing provisions
are excluded by the Automatic Stay are set out in the Corporations (Stay on Enforcing Certain Rights)
_Regulations 2018 (“Regulations”) and the_ _Corporations (Stay on Enforcing Certain Rights)_
_Declaration 2018 (“Declaration”)._

The Declaration declares the various rights (including self-executing clauses that, when executed,
provide those rights) that are excluded from the operation of the Automatic Stay and those rights that
remain available to the parties should a trigger event occur.

The Automatic Stay applies to ipso facto rights arising under contracts, agreements or arrangements
entered into at or after July 1, 2018, subject to certain exclusions set out in the Corporations Act,
subordinate regulations and a Declaration related to the TLA Act that also came into effect on July 1,
2018. The subordinate regulations prescribe that a right contained in a kind of contract, agreement or
arrangement for the underwriting of an issue, or sale, of bonds or that is, or governs, bonds, is not
subject to the Automatic Stay.

Rights exercised with the consent of the relevant administrator, managing controller, scheme
administrator, restructuring practitioner (or a liquidator if a liquidation follows the administration or
scheme) and the right to appoint a controller (in respect of security over the whole or substantially the
whole property) during the decision period following the appointment of administrators are excluded.
In addition to the exclusions currently applicable as a result of related subordinate regulations and the
Declaration that came into effect on July 1, 2018, rights prescribed by regulations or Ministerial
declarations following July 1, 2018 may also be excluded. Any such subordinate legislation that may
be implemented following July 1, 2018 may also prescribe additional reasons to which the automatic
stay on enforcement applies. The Automatic Stay does not apply retrospectively (i.e., for agreements
entered into prior to the new provisions coming into force on 1 July 2018).

The ipso facto legislation also gives the Court the power to impose stay orders in respect of a potentially
broader range of contractual rights (where the court is satisfied that the relevant right is being exercised,
is likely to be exercised or there is a threat that it might be exercised because of one of the prescribed
reasons described above) or lift the Automatic Stay (where the Court is satisfied that doing so is in the
interests of justice) and extend the duration of the Automatic Stay.

501


-----

The effect of the _ipso facto reforms means that, in the event of a Guarantor being subject to the_
appointment of a voluntary administrator, a managing controller over the whole or substantially the
whole of its property or a scheme of arrangement (for the purpose of avoiding it being wound up in
insolvency), the rights of any counterparty to a contract with a Guarantor that would otherwise be
enlivened by those insolvency events (or triggered by its financial position whilst affected by one of
those affected procedures) may be unenforceable. This may affect the exercise of rights under the Note
Guarantee provided by the Australian Guarantor as against the Australian Guarantor.

Until judicial consideration of the new provisions of the Corporations Act as introduced by the TLA
Act, the subordinate regulations and the Declaration and any changes in market practice, the scope of
the _ipso facto reform and its potential effect on the Note Guarantee provided by the Australian_
Guarantor remains uncertain.

###### FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

**NOTES TO THE INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**1** **General information**

Ardonagh Group Holdings Limited (the Company) is a private company limited by shares with registered number 13789356. It was
incorporated and registered in England and Wales on 8 December 2021. The address of its registered office is 2 Minster Court,
Mincing Lane, London, EC3R 7PD.

These interim condensed consolidated financial statements comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (the Group) and have been
prepared in connection with the shareholders’ deed, the USD 500.0m PIK toggle notes due 2027 indenture and the privately placed
term loan facilities agreement due 2026 (incorporating the term, CAR and RCF facilities).

A newly created company Tara Topco Limited (‘Tara’) obtained a significant new equity investment led by long-term shareholders
in the former Ardonagh holding company, The Ardonagh Group Limited (‘TAGL’), alongside new co-investors through accounts
managed by MDP and HPS. The new equity investment resulted in TAGL merging into Tara on 31 May 2022. Following this merger,
the Company acquired Ardonagh New Midco 3 Limited (‘NM3L’), including the group of companies previously owned by TAGL, on
1 June 2022 and the Ardonagh Group activities are thereafter overseen by the Company as an indirect subsidiary of Tara. The prior
period comparatives therefore reflect the fact that during the nine-month period to 30 September 2022 the Company had only
four months of trading.

As announced on 15 September, Ardonagh and Markerstudy Group (‘Markerstudy’) have agreed a merger between Markerstudy
and Ardonagh’s Atlanta Group of businesses to create a major new player in the UK insurance market with the transaction subject
to customary conditions (including regulatory approvals). Owing to the forthcoming merger, the financial information presented
in this interim report is shown to identify the impact of Ardonagh Retail ceasing to be part of Ardonagh. This includes the
presentation of Ardonagh Retail as held for sale on the statement of financial position, as a discontinued operation on the income
statement and the cash flow statement, as well as other explanations in note 26 of section 2.

The financial information contained in these interim results does not constitute statutory accounts of the Company within the
meaning of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. Statutory accounts for the period ended 31
December 2022 were approved by the Board of Directors on 22 March 2023. The report of the auditors on those accounts was
unqualified and did not contain an emphasis of matter paragraph.

**2** **Basis of preparation**

The interim condensed consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim
Financial Reporting, as adopted by the United Kingdom. They do not include all the information required for a complete set of IFRS
financial statements. However, selected notes are included to explain events and transactions that are significant to an
understanding of the Group’s financial position and performance.

The interim condensed consolidated financial statements are presented in GBP sterling (£).

Amounts shown are rounded to the nearest thousand, unless stated otherwise.

The interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified to
use a different measurement basis where necessary to comply with or permitted by IFRS.

The Group’s business or the revenues received are not subject to significant seasonality or cyclicality.

**Going concern**

The interim condensed consolidated financial statements of the Group set out on pages 12 to 20 have been prepared on a going
concern basis. At 30 September 2023, the Group had net assets of £2,992.0m (31 December 2022: £2,924.5m) and net current
assets of £1,408.4m (31 December 2022: £279.6m). The Group reported an operating profit of £54.1m for the nine months ended
30 September 2023 (30 September 2022: £13.1m), net cash inflows from operating activities of £278.7m (30 September 2022:
£232.4m) and cash inflows of £111.2m (30 September 2022: £1,173.0m). Available cash, including held for sale, of £202.2m was
reported at 30 September 2023 (31 December 2022: £269.6m).

###### FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

**NOTES TO THE INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**2** **Basis of preparation (continued)**

The Directors have assessed the Group’s financial position and its ability to meet its obligations as and when they fall due. In
making the going concern assessment the Directors have taken into account the following:

  - The Group’s capital structure, operations and liquidity.

  - Base case and stressed cash flow forecasts over the calendar years 2023 and 2024.

  - The impact on the base case and stressed cashflow forecasts arising from subsequent material acquisitions and as a result
of Ardonagh Retail ceasing to be part of Ardonagh following the expected merger between Markerstudy and Ardonagh’s
Atlanta Group of businesses.

  - The principal risks facing the Group. and its systems of risk management and internal control.

  - The Group’s capital management, among other things, aims to ensure that it meets financial covenants attached to its
interest-bearing loans and borrowings. There have been no breaches of the financial covenants of any interest-bearing
loans and borrowings in the current period.

  - Actual trading and cashflows of the period and the continued positive results in October 2023.

Key assumptions that the Directors have reflected in the base case cash flow forecasts include that:

  - The Group will continue to benefit from a £191.5m Revolving Credit Facility that is not drawn at the date of this report.

  - Client retention and renewal rates remain robust, despite current economic uncertainties, with the trading performance
continuing to demonstrate resilience across the Group.

  - Interest costs are modelled using current forward interest rates (other than where interest rates on debt have been fixed
through interest rate swaps).

Key stress scenarios that the Directors have considered include cumulative stresses to the base plan as a result of:

  - Shortfalls in base case projected income throughout 2023 and 2024.

  - Deterioration in base case cash conversion rates over and above the shortfalls in income.

  - An inflationary cost increase of 2% over the base case assumptions.

  - Additional interest costs on the term and CAR debt facilities applying the maximum additional margins that can be
triggered.

  - Mitigating actions within management control including delayed capital expenditure, a reduction in discretionary spend
and measured reductions in employee headcount and remuneration.

The Directors have also modelled reverse stress scenarios, including assessing those that result in a default on the Group’s term
debt facilities that would require a technical repayment obligation and those that would exhaust available liquidity. The stresses
needed for these outcomes to happen significantly exceed the key stress scenarios above and the Directors consider such
conditions to be a remote possibility. Other mitigations which may be possible in the stress scenarios but have not been included
in the analysis include seeking shareholder support, securitising premium receivables and further incremental and more prolonged
cost reductions.

The Directors continue to consider the wider operational and financial consequences and ramifications of global political and
economic tensions (including related to the Ukrainian conflict, foreign exchange rates, inflation and increasing interest rates). In
particular:

  - Insurance broking is a resilient and defensive market, which has historically had limited impact from past economic or
capital market downturns. The Group is highly diversified and not unduly exposed to a single carrier, customer or market
sector.

  - Although economic developments remain fluid, the stress testing demonstrates the Group’s financial resilience and
operating flexibility.

  - As a result of Russia invading Ukraine, we have seen significant new sanctions legislation from a range of legislators
(including the US, EU and UK), with newly sanctioned entities and individuals, and new (or wider in scope) sectoral
sanctions targeting Russia (and Belarus). The Ardonagh Group has no appetite for potential breaches of applicable
sanctions regimes and applies appropriate controls including automated screening of clients against relevant sanctions
lists. We continue to actively monitor the situation as it develops and will respond accordingly as new sanctions are
enacted.

  - The Group continues to monitor the risk of cyber-attacks, but the Group has not identified any significant security risks
during the period ended 30 September 2023.

Following the assessment of the Group’s financial position and its ability to meet its obligations as and when they fall due, including
the further potential financial implications of economic uncertainty included in stress tests, the Directors are not aware of any
material uncertainties that cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.

###### FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

**NOTES TO THE INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**3** **Accounting policies**

Except as described below, the accounting policies adopted are consistent with those applied in the preparation of the Group’s
consolidated financial statements for the period ended 31 December 2022.

The Group has adopted the amendment to IAS 12 as a result of the International Tax Reform – Pillar Two Model Rules. The
amendment provides a temporary mandatory exception from accounting for deferred taxes arising from legislations enacted to
implement the Pillar Two Model Rules. The amendment also introduces additional disclosure requirements that will be applicable
to the Group’s consolidated financial statements for the period ending 31 December 2023. Management is actively monitoring the
status of legislations that are at different stages of enactment in the jurisdictions in which the Group operates. Management will
review the Group’s tax exposure and provide relevant information once the legislations are enacted.

There have been no other amendments to accounting standards that have become effective in the year beginning 1 January 2023
that have had a material impact on the Group interim condensed consolidated financial statements.

**4** **Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty**

Estimates and judgements used in preparing the interim condensed consolidated financial statements are continually evaluated
and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be
reasonable. The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results.

The estimates and assumptions that have a significant effect on the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities are discussed below.

**Critical judgements in applying accounting policies**

The Company obtained control of NM3L on 1 June 2022, which is the owner of Ardonagh Midco 1 Limited (Midco 1) and thus the
businesses that were previously part of the Ardonagh Group that existed prior to 1 June 2022 headed by The Ardonagh Group
Limited. For the year ended 31 December 2022, the Company applied acquisition accounting in accordance with IFRS 3 Business
Combinations to the acquisition of NM3L and, in the consolidated financial statements of the Group, it therefore measured the
identifiable net assets acquired of NM3L at fair value on 1 June 2022, which included the recognition of intangible assets arising
on a business combination and the recognition of goodwill and non-controlling interests. A critical judgement was applied in the
prior year to determine if it was appropriate to apply acquisition accounting, which included consideration of the wider transaction,
if there had been a change in control, and who was the acquirer. Acquisition accounting was applied as a business had been
acquired and because the Company clearly obtained control of that business.

As at 31 December 2022, the Group had not completed the acquisition accounting of NM3L. Goodwill recognised in the prior year’s
consolidated financial statements was based on provisional fair values of the assets acquired. The initial allocation of goodwill to
the cash generating units was also done on a provisional basis in accordance with IAS 36. During the current year, the Group
completed the acquisition accounting of NM3L, and the resulting amount of goodwill has been finalised and reallocated to cashgenerating units in a manner that is most appropriate to the business.

During 2023, the Group entered into negotiations to dispose of the entire share capital of Atlanta Investment Holdings 3 Limited
(‘AIH3L’), being the holding company for the Retail operating segment (the ‘disposal group’). On 1 September 2023, all material
matters fundamental to the deal were agreed upon with the buyer and there were no further matters that could have caused the
planned sale to be withdrawn or changed significantly. Consequently, as at that date the disposal group was classified as held for
sale in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations. At that date, the carrying values of
all assets and liabilities within the disposal group were measured in accordance with applicable IFRS and then compared to the fair
value less cost to sell of the disposal group. The excess, if any, of the carrying value of the disposal group over its fair value less
cost to sell is required to be recognised as an impairment loss. There was no material difference between the carrying value and
the fair value less cost to sell of the disposal group and therefore no impairment loss was recognised. Furthermore, in accordance
with IFRS 5, from the date of classification as held for sale, non-current assets within the disposal group are not subject to
depreciation or amortisation.

**4** **Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty (continued)**

**Key sources of estimation uncertainty**

**Impairment of assets**

The Group tests annually whether goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives have suffered any impairment.
Other assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the
assets may exceed its recoverable amount. The last annual impairment test was performed as at 1 July 2023 (see note 8).

An impairment test of an asset or cash-generating unit (or group of cash-generating units) is performed by comparing its carrying
amount with its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value in
use, where its value in use is the present value of its future cash flows. An impairment test requires the application of significant
judgement because it relies on key assumptions, including forecast cash flows, a discount rate, a terminal growth rate and an
Adjusted EBITDA multiple. Accordingly, the resulting estimates are significant estimates because there is a significant risk of a
material adjustment to the carrying amounts of affected balances within the next financial year.

Goodwill arising from a new business combination is, for the purposes of impairment testing, allocated to those cash-generating
units that are expected to benefit from the goodwill that was acquired. Impairment testing is performed at the level of the smallest
groups of cash-generating units at which goodwill is monitored, known as the divisions.

Forecast cash flows used in the value in use calculation were determined by considering historic business performance, by
overlaying it with assumptions to reflect areas where growth or income improvement was expected, and by taking into account
the expected results of cost management programmes to which the Group was committed. These forecasts were extrapolated to
subsequent years using a steady growth rate being the CPI inflation rate of 2%, and a terminal value was calculated using the
perpetual growth model. The discount rate of 9.55% to 11.45% that was applied to the forecasts was a market participant weighted
average cost of capital calculated by reference to the Capital Asset Pricing Model.

The fair value of the Group was calculated based on multiples of forecast 2024 Adjusted EBITDA and on information provided by
external advisors, where that information is based on recent transactions in the insurance broking industry. The fair value of a
division was estimated by apportioning the fair value of the Group between the divisions based on the value in use of each division.
The estimated costs of disposal are assumed, based on market experience, to be 1.5% of the fair value of the division.

See note 8 for the carrying values of goodwill and intangible assets at the period end. Further, As at 30 September 2023, there
were no indications of impairment and therefore no impairment test has been performed.

**5** **Segmental analysis**

Descriptions of the Group’s operating platforms can be found in Section 1 – Our Businesses.

Under IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’, the Group determines and presents operating segments based on the information that is
provided to the Group Executive Committee, which is the Group’s chief operating decision maker.

Operating segments are reviewed and revised as necessary following structural changes within the Group or on significant business
combinations.

The Group Executive Committee assesses the performance of the operating segments based on an Adjusted EBITDA measure and
cash generation forecasts to meet debt obligations to the Corporate segment. The presentation of the segment information
reflects that. The Group Executive Committee assesses the financial position of the Group on a consolidated Group basis and
therefore does not regularly receive measures of total assets or total liabilities on an operating segment basis. Accordingly, no
financial position measures are reported within the Group’s segmental analysis.

The results include items directly attributable to an operating segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.

The Retail segment was classified as a discontinued operation in the current period and segment information reported on the next
pages does not include any amounts for discontinued operations, which are described in more detail in note 26.

Of the Total Income disclosed in the consolidated income statement, £498.7m (2022; £159.3m) is attributable to sales made to
clients outside the UK.

Commissions and fees represent the Group’s revenue from contracts with customers which is recognised in accordance with IFRS
15. The Group’s operating segments reflect its disaggregation of revenue.

###### FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

**NOTES TO THE INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**7** **Income and deferred tax**

Income tax credit for the interim condensed consolidated financial statements is recognised based on management’s estimate of
the weighted average effective annual income tax rate expected for the full financial year (including the impact of legislated
changes to the tax rate), adjusted for the tax effect of certain items recognised in full during the interim period.

The effective tax rate in these interim condensed consolidated financial statements is 9.9% giving rise to a tax credit on continuing
operations of £25.3m.

The tax charge differs from that which would result from applying the standard rate of corporation tax, mainly due to the impact
of non-UK earnings, statutory restrictions on the deductibility of interest expense and the recognition of deferred tax assets against
future projections of taxable income.

The tax charge on discontinued operations in these interim condensed consolidated financial statements is £6.7m. This includes a
one-off tax charge of £3.9m which has arisen due to the classification of the disposal group as held for sale.

The Group has adopted International Tax Reform – Pillar Two Model Rules – Amendments to IAS 12 upon their release on 23 May
2023. The amendments provide a temporary mandatory exception from deferred tax accounting for the top-up tax, which is
effective immediately, and require new disclosures about the Pillar Two exposure from 31 December 2023. The mandatory
exception applies retrospectively. However, because no new legislation to implement the top-up tax was enacted or substantively
enacted at 31 December 2022 in any jurisdiction in which the Group operates and no related deferred taxes were recognised at
that date, the retrospective application has no impact on the Group’s condensed interim financial statements. The relief and the
new disclosures will also be reflected in the Group’s consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ending 31 December
2023.

Goodwill is tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that it may be impaired. The annual impairment
test was performed at 1 July 2023, which resulted in no impairment.

For the nine-month period to 30 September 2023, the Group reviewed the trading performance of each division, to determine
whether there is an indication of impairment and thus to determine whether an impairment test is to be performed. It was
concluded that there is no indication of impairment.

The acquisitions were accounted for under IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’, which requires that the identifiable assets acquired
and the liabilities assumed, including certain contingent liabilities, are measured at their acquisition date fair value. Goodwill is
calculated as the difference between the acquisition consideration (grossed up for non-controlling interest) and the acquisition
date fair value of the net assets/(liabilities) acquired. Goodwill represents expected synergies from combining operations of the
acquiree and the Group, and/or intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition, and is allocated to the acquirer’s
cash generating units, or groups of cash-generating units, that are expected to benefit from the synergies from combining
operations of the acquiree and the Group.

The amounts recognised in the interim condensed consolidated financial statements are provisional and adjustment may occur
during the remainder of the applicable measurement period.

Fair value measurement

Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value in the interim condensed consolidated financial statement of financial position
are grouped into three levels of a fair value hierarchy. The three levels are defined based on the observability of significant inputs
to the measurement, as follows:

  - Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

  - Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly
as prices, or indirectly derived from prices; and

  - Level 3: unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.

The following table shows the levels within the hierarchy of financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on an ongoing
basis:

###### FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

**NOTES TO THE INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**17** **Financial instruments (continued)**

The following valuation techniques are used for instruments categorised in Levels 2 and 3:

**Derivative financial instruments (Level 2)**

The Group’s derivatives are categorised within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. These contracts are not traded in an active
market, but the fair value is determined using valuation techniques and available market data, such as forward exchange rates
corresponding to the maturity of the contract observable at the statement of financial position date and an appropriate sector
credit spread.

**Trade and other receivables/contingent consideration receivable (Level 3)**

Trade and other receivables include contingent consideration receivable with a fair value of £4.2m, which arose from an acquisition
by the group previously held by TAGL. This is categorised within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy with the valuation based on
management’s best estimate of the probability of the successful completion of the requirements set out in the sale and purchase
agreements.

Also included in trade and other receivables at 30 September 2023 were assets at fair value through profit or loss that were
recognised on business combinations in relation to the Group’s right to variable consideration on contracts with customers for
which the performance obligation was satisfied prior to the acquisition. The fair value is a level 3 valuation and is calculated as the
present value of future cash flows where those cash flows take into account expected cancellation rates and the life of the
underlying insurance product.

**Contingent consideration, share buyout and deferred proceeds (Level 3)**

The contingent consideration, deferred consideration and share buyout liability were acquired on the acquisition of NM3L on 1
June 2022 and amounts arising on the acquisition of Stuart Insurances, Lorega Holdings Limited, Leobros B.V., Frank Glennon
Limited, Envest Pty Limited, Oxford Insurance Group Limited, the Matrix Group of companies, K.N.C. Holdings Company Limited,
InsurVest B.V. and other acquisitions that are individually not material.

Share buyout is the liability arising from put options granted to minority shareholders of certain consolidated subsidiaries, giving
the holders the right to sell all of their interest in those subsidiaries to the Group. The fair value of the share buyout payments is
determined based on the discounted present value of the forecast option strike price, where the discount rate is the pre-tax market
participant WACC for the respective division if the strike price is a multiple of forecast EBITDA less net debt.

Contingent consideration payments are generally contingent on the post-acquisition performance of the acquired business and
achievement of certain performance thresholds. The fair value of contingent consideration is determined based on actual and
forecast business performance of the acquired business, discounted using the pre-tax market participant WACC for the respective
division as the discount rate.

**Unlisted investments at fair value through other comprehensive income (Level 3)**

Unlisted investments are categorised within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The valuation technique requires specific market
price information in order to support an increase in the fair value measurement.

**Fair value of financial instruments measured at amortised cost**

The Directors consider the carrying amounts for trade and other receivables, trade and other payables and the current portion of
financial liabilities that are not measured at fair value to approximate their fair values. The fair value of the Group’s borrowings is
disclosed in note 21.

**Derivatives**

The Group has economic hedge relationships that mitigate, [i] foreign exchange risk arising from its USD revenue and, [ii] foreign
exchange rate and interest rate risk on SOFR, Euribor, and AUD BBSY borrowings, which have been designated in a hedge
accounting relationship. The Group manages all other risks associated with these exposures, such as credit risk, but it does not
apply hedge accounting for those risks.

Derivatives are only used for hedging purposes. The Group has the following derivative financial instruments as at the end of the

###### FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

**NOTES TO THE INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**Derivatives hedging borrowings**

The Group entered into interest rate swaps of USD 200.0m, USD 200.0m and USD 140.0m on 23 June 2022, 1 July 2022 and 26 July
2022 respectively, the purpose of which was to hedge the USD floating rate exposure on its USD 540.0m CAR facility due 2026.
The 23 June 2022 and 26 July 2022 swaps mature on 14 January 2027. The 1 July 2022 swap matures on 14 January 2026. On 1
August 2023, the Group entered into an interest rate swap to hedge USD floating rate exposure on USD 200.0m of the B3 USD
540.0m facility from January 2026 to January 2027. All four instruments exchange a floating interest rate with a fixed interest rate.
Interest rate swaps referencing USD LIBOR have either been amended to Term SOFR or have transitioned during the period to
replacement rates using the standard International Swaps and Derivatives Association transition process.

The Group entered into three interest rate swaps of EUR150.0m each on 18 January 2023, 17 February 2023 and 7 March 2023,
the purpose of which was to hedge the EURIBOR rate exposure on its B1 EUR 184.2m term facility due 2026, B3 EUR 187.3m CAR
facility due 2026 and B4 EUR 240.0m CAR facility due 2026, respectively. These instruments exchange a floating interest rate with
a fixed interest rate and will mature on 17 July 2026.

The Group entered into an interest rate swap of GBP 250.0m on 20 January 2023, the purpose of which was to hedge GBP SONIA
rate exposure on its B2 GBP 300.0m CAR facility due 2026. The instrument exchanges a floating interest rate with a fixed interest
rate and has matured on 17 July 2023.

The Group entered into an interest rate swap of USD 150.0m on 10 February 2023, the purpose of which was to hedge the USD
SOFR rate exposure on the USD 182.5m drawn on its B5 USD 365.0m CAR Facility due 2026. The instrument exchanges a floating
interest rate with a fixed interest rate and will mature on 20 July 2026.

The Group entered into an interest rate swap of AUD 100.0m on 26 April 2023, the purpose of which was to hedge the AUD-BBSY
exposure on AUD 100.0m of the AUD 200.0m AUD facility due 2028. The instrument exchanges a floating interest rate with a fixed
interest rate on a quarterly basis and will mature on 4 August 2026.

**Derivatives hedging forecast revenue**

The Group enters into forward contracts to mitigate the exposure resulting from USD revenue arising on the placement of certain
premiums denominated in USD, which is not the presentation currency nor functional currency of the Group.

Based on forecast transactions, the Group effectively sells accumulated USD revenue by reference to individual brokerage
transactions. The Group’s track record in receiving USD revenue from long established clients provides a high degree of confidence
that forecast transactions are highly probable for hedge accounting purposes.

On 1 October 2022, the Group designated its PIK toggle notes in a hedging relationship with this forecast USD revenue.

On 9 March 2023, the Group designated a portion of the B3 (USD) facility – USD 540.0m in a hedging relationship with forecast
USD revenue that was previously unhedged.

The size of the obligation is sensitive to judgemental actuarial assumptions which have been updated by independent qualified
actuaries to take account of the requirement of IAS 19 Employee Benefits. These include demographic assumptions covering
mortality, economic assumptions covering price inflation and benefit increases, together with the discount rate.

The principal actuarial assumptions are as follows:

The rate of inflation is derived from the RPI in the UK. The breakeven rate in the Eurozone is used for the basis for the German
inflation assumption. For the nine months ended 30 September 2023, the most significant change was a rise in the UK discount
rate by 0.70% p.a. and for the Eurozone 0.39%.

**24** **Related party transactions**

The Group has related party debtors as at 30 September 2023 of £129.1m (31 December 2022: £120.7m) (see note 15) and related
party creditors of £8.9m (31 December 2022: £25.2m) (see note 19). Of these balances Tara Topco Limited accounts for £128.0m
of the £129.1m related party debtor balance (31 December 2022: £119.6m) and all of the related party creditor balance as at 30
September 2023 and 31 December 2022. Of the related party balance movements in the quarter, transactions with Tara Topco
Limited accounted for all the increase in related party debtors and related party creditors. Tara Topco Ltd (‘Tara’) is the Company’s
ultimate parent company. The balances arise from transactions where amounts are paid or received by Ardonagh on behalf of
Tara. The majority of the related party debtor from Tara relates to non-current term loans.

**25** **Subsequent events**

On 2 November 2023, the Group purchased the entire share capital of Santis HoldCo AG for consideration of CHF 104.4m and
deferred consideration with a fair value of CHF 85.5m. Santis HoldCo AG was the ultimate parent of Assepro AG, the largest
independent commercial broker for small and medium-sized enterprises in Switzerland. The acquisition has been included in the
International Advisory operating segment.

The Group completed the acquisition of several individually not material businesses after the reporting period the aggregate
consideration for which was £19.7m, EUR 27.7m and AUD 37.9m paid in cash, plus deferred consideration with a fair value of EUR
0.1m and AUD 4.0m, plus contingent consideration with a fair value of £6.8m, EUR 0.1m and AUD 2.4m, plus share buyout liabilities
(ordinary shares) with a fair value of AUD 8.4m.

On 11 October 2023, the Group entered into a new 15-year lease on its Minster Court offices, resulting in an opening right-of-use
asset and lease liability of £15.5m.

On 31 October 2023, USD 130.0m of the USD 460.0 m B6 CAR facility was drawn to fund the acquisition of Assepro AG.

On 3 November 2023, The Envest Group Pty Limited (formerly Ardonagh Australia Pty Ltd) issued 742,574 Ordinary shares to
Reginetti Holdings Pty Ltd (a subsidiary of Macquarie Group) for AUD 150.0m. These shares are subject to a share buyout
obligation.

On 9 January 2024, USD 182.5m of the USD 365.0 m B5 CAR facility was drawn.

On 1 December 2023 the Group completed the disposal of Accurisk Holdings LLC, for consideration of USD 95.9m.

**26** **Disposal group held for sale and discontinued operations**

As announced on 15 September, Ardonagh and Markerstudy Group (‘Markerstudy’) have agreed a merger between Markerstudy
and Ardonagh’s Atlanta Group of businesses to create a major new player in the UK insurance market with the transaction subject
to customary conditions (including regulatory approvals). It is difficult to predict the timing for the satisfaction of the completion
conditions, although the transaction is not expected to complete in 2023. Owing to the forthcoming merger, the financial
information presented in this interim report is shown to identify the impact of Ardonagh Retail ceasing to be part of Ardonagh.
This includes the presentation of Ardonagh Retail as held for sale on the statement of financial position, as a discontinued
operation on the income statement and the cash flow statement, as well as other explanations in this note.

During the period, the disposal group contributed £42.2m (2022: £25.2m) to the Group’s net operating cash flows, paid £18.5m
(2022: £8.6m) in respect of investing activities and paid £2.7m (2022: £2.4m) in respect of financing activities.

###### AUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

 FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2022


-----

###### INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF ARDONAGH MIDCO 2 PLC

 Report on the audit of the financial statements

 1. Opinion


In our opinion:



- the financial statements of Ardonagh Midco 2 Plc (the ‘parent company’) and its subsidiaries (the
‘group’) give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 31
December 2022 and of the group’s loss for the year then ended;

- the group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom
adopted international accounting standards;

- the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice, including Financial Reporting Standard 101
“Reduced Disclosure Framework”; and

- the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies
Act 2006.

We have audited the financial statements which comprise:

  - the consolidated statement of profit and loss and other comprehensive income;

  - the consolidated and parent company statements of financial position;

  - the consolidated and parent company statements of changes in equity;

  - the consolidated statement of cash flows; and

  - the related notes 1 to 35 to the consolidated financial statements and 1 to 13 to the parent

The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the group financial
statements is applicable law, and United Kingdom adopted international accounting standards. The
financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the parent company financial
statements is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including FRS 101 “Reduced
Disclosure Framework” (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).

###### 2. Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and
applicable law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the auditor’s
responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report.

We are independent of the group and the parent company in accordance with the ethical requirements
that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the Financial Reporting
Council’s (the ‘FRC’s’) Ethical Standard as applied to listed entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for
our opinion.

###### INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF ARDONAGH MIDCO 2 PLC

 Report on the audit of the financial statements

 3. Summary of our audit approach

Key audit matters The key audit matters that we identified in the current period were:

                    - Acquisition accounting under IFRS 3 Business Combinations – Ed Broking Group Limited, Besso
Insurance Group Limited

                    - Presentation of Alternative Performance Measures (‘APMs’); and

                    - Goodwill impairment.

Materiality The materiality that we used for the group financial statements was £9m which was determined on the basis
of 0.76% of revenue.

Scoping Scoping coverage included 7 components subject to full scope audits and a further 17 subject to the audit of
specified account balances. These scoped in entities represent 77% of revenue and 73% of insurance
debtors.


Significant changes in our
approach


In the current year, we no longer consider the following as key audit matters:

   - Going concern was removed as a key audit matter following improvement in the group’s
operating profit and an improved liquidity position.

   - We re-visited our risk assessment on revenue recognition in the group and no longer consider the
risk associated with the acquisition of Swinton to be a key audit matter.

   - The Preference share issue: classification as debt or equity was a one-off event in 2021 and is not
applicable in 2022.


###### 4. Conclusions relating to going concern
In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors’ use of the going concern basis
of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.

Our evaluation of the directors’ assessment of the group and the parent company’s ability to continue to
adopt the going concern basis of accounting included:

- Gained an understanding of management’s process and controls for performing the going concern
assessment.

- Challenged key assumptions underpinning cash flow forecasts, the stresses applied and the reverse
stress test by performing an analysis and comparison of actual performance versus prior period going
concern forecasts to assess management’s ability to forecast.

- Performed a sensitivity analyses over management’s forecasts for interest rate volatility and inflation
to assess the appropriatness of the headroom.

- Inspected correspondence between the group and its regulators.


-----

###### INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF ARDONAGH MIDCO 2 PLC

 Report on the audit of the financial statements

- Performed an analysis of the group’s financial performance in the first five months after the balance
sheet date.

- Assessed financial statement disclosures in respect of going concern for transparency and inclusion of
all facts and circumstances of which we are aware through the performance of the audit work.

Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to
events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the group's and parent
company’s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least twelve months from when the
financial statements are authorised for issue.

Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in
the relevant sections of this report.

###### 5. Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our
audit of the financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of
material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we identified. These matters included those
which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit; and
directing the efforts of the engagement team.

These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in
forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

5.1 Acquisition accounting under IFRS 3 Business combinations – Ed Broking Group Limited, Besso

Insurance Group Limited

Key audit matter description On 1 November 2021 the group acquired the entire issued share capital of Ed Broking Group Limited and
Besso Insurance Group Limited (“Ed, Besso”). This transaction constituted a business combination under
IFRS 3 Business combinations, and resulted in the recognition of £250m of goodwill and £130m separately
acquired intangible assets.

Management engaged a third-party expert to perform an independent fair value assessment of the acquired
intangible assets at the valuation date and perform the Purchase Price Allocation (“PPA”) for financial
reporting purposes. Management had 12 months from the date of acquisition to finalise the acquisition
accounting. This period elapsed during 2022 and the numbers reported in respect of this acquisition are
final.

Transactions that constitute a business combination under IFRS 3 must be accounted for by applying the
acquisition method, so that the assets and liabilities assumed are recognised by the acquirer at their
acquisition-date fair values. Key steps in the acquisition method that were completed during the year were:

               - Recognition and measurement of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed; and

               - Recognition and measurement of goodwill.
The Ed, Besso acquisition is considered a key audit matter due to the scale of the transaction, the complexity
of accounting due to the PPA approach, and the impact of these on the financial statements.

Refer to Note 11 to the financial statements (Intangible assets).


-----

###### INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF ARDONAGH MIDCO 2 PLC

 Report on the audit of the financial statements


How the scope of our audit
responded to the key audit
matter


We have obtained an understanding of the relevant controls over management’s process for acquisition
accounting.

In addition, we performed the following audit procedures:

- Assessed management’s projections, forecasts and accounting assumptions including the impact of a
high inflation environment on the underlying cash flow assumptions, used in the fair value analysis.

- Tested the completeness and accuracy of data inputs used in the valuation of goodwill and intangible
assets.

- Involved our valuation specialists in assessing the reasonableness of the key valuation assumptions and
whether the valuation assumptions are consistent with what market participants would use in pricing
the item.


Key observations We are satisfied that the acquisition accounting under IFRS 3 Business combinations for Ed Broking Group
Limited and Besso Insurance Group Limited is appropriate.

5.2 Presentation of Alternative Performance Measures (APMs)

Key audit matter description Adjusted EBITDA is a key metric that management use to assess the quality of the group’s earnings.
Management removes adjusting items (“Items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA”), being significant
acquisition and disposal related items and other costs associated with the ongoing transformation of the
group. Pro formas are presented as if the significant acquisition and disposal related transactions occurred
on the first day of the comparative period.

The group reports a Loss for the period of £280.8m, an EBITDA of £269.8m and Adjusted EBITDA of
£373.4m in the Annual Report.

This measure and other such non-GAAP measures used are Alternative Performance Measures (“APMs”). An
APM is defined by European Securities and Markets Authority (“ESMA”) as “a financial measure of historical
or future performance, financial position, or cash flows, other than a financial measure defined or specified
in the applicable financial reporting framework (e.g. UK adopted IFRS) applied by the entity”.

The group defines adjusting items in the Glossary in Section 3 of the Annual Report. A risk exists that these
adjusting items are not consistently applied across the group. In addition, there is a risk that these adjusting
items are not clearly disclosed in note 5 and that undue prominence is given to APMs compared to the
statutory results of the group within the financial statements.

Refer to section 1 of the Annual Report (Performance review) and section 3 of the Annual Report (Other
unaudited financial information).


-----

###### INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF ARDONAGH MIDCO 2 PLC

 Report on the audit of the financial statements


How the scope of our
audit responded to the
key audit matter


We have obtained an understanding of the relevant controls over management’s
process for APMs.
In addition, we performed the following procedures:

- Tested a sample of items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA to assess consistency
with the group’s published definition and policies for these items;

- Tested the accuracy of a sample of underlying expenses excluded from
Adjusted EBITDA to invoices or other supporting evidence;

- Assessed whether the use of APMs in the group’s financial statements is
consistent with the guidelines produced by regulators;

- Assessed whether there is appropriate balance between the use of statutory
metrics, Adjusted EBITDA and other Pro Forma metrics, together with clear
definitions and reconciliations within the Annual Report;

- Assessed the prominence given to Adjusted EBITDA and other Pro Forma
metrics relative to the group’s statutory results; and

- Considered whether Adjusted EBITDA and other Pro Forma metrics were
consistently applied in the current period’s financial statements.


Key observations We considered that the group’s use and presentation of Alternative Performance
Measures was acceptable and consistently applied.

###### INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF ARDONAGH MIDCO 2 PLC

 Report on the audit of the financial statements

5.3 Goodwill impairment

Key audit matter description Goodwill arising on business combinations is a significant asset on the balance sheet of the group £2,027m
(2021: £1,620m). Goodwill increased significantly during 2022 following significant acquisitions including
that of Ed Broking Group Limited and Besso Insurance Group Limited.

As required by IAS 36 Impairment of Assets, goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually.

During 2022 the group continued to monitor goodwill at the division level as this remained the lowest level
of aggregation of cash generating units within the group at which goodwill could be monitored for
management purposes. Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the recoverable
amount of each division, using the higher of value in use (“VIU”) and fair value less costs to dispose
(“FVLCD”).

The VIU amount is subjective and calculated using an impairment model underpinned by key assumptions
including forecast cash flows, discount rates and long-term growth rates.

Management use a VIU approach to assess the recoverable amount of all divisions. A headroom calculation
is performed as the amount of calculated VIU above the carrying value of the division. Divisions with less
head room are at greater risk of impairment where the impairment model is sensitive to key assumptions.

Management performed this assessment and concluded an impairment of £41m was required in the MGA
division after the higher of value in use (“VIU”) and fair value less costs to dispose (“FVLCD”) calculated was
less than the carrying amount of goodwill allocated to this division.

Refer to Note 4 to the financial statements (Key sources of estimation uncertainty) and Note 11 to the
financial statements (Intangible assets).


How the scope of our audit
responded to the key audit
matter


We have gained an understanding of management’s process for performing the annual impairment test and
obtained an understanding of relevant controls.

In addition, we performed the following audit procedures:

- challenged management’s CGU assessment through assessing the level at which cash inflows are
generated and the level at which goodwill is monitored;

- challenged the assumptions used in the annual impairment review, in particular forecast growth rates
applied to each of the divisions within the five year business plan through assessing segment strategies
and planned business development;

- tested the accuracy of the calculations behind management’s impairment model;

- performed an assessment of actual FY 2022 cash flows against prior period forecasts to assess the
accuracy of management’s forecasting; and

- involved our valuation specialists to assess and challenge the discount rate used.


-----

###### INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF ARDONAGH MIDCO 2 PLC

 Report on the audit of the financial statements

Key observations We agree with management’s conclusion that an impairment is required to the goodwill allocated to the
MGA division as of the date of the impairment exercise.

The forecasts used in the annual impairment exercise were consistent with the most recent financial
forecasts approved by the Board.

Key assumptions including discount rates and growth rates used within business forecasts are reasonable.

###### 6. Our application of materiality

6.1 Materiality
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable
that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We
use materiality both in planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work.

Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole
as follows:

Group financial statements Parent company financial statements

Materiality £9m (2021: £9m) £8.1m (2021: £8.1m)


Basis for
determining
materiality

Rationale for the
benchmark
applied


0.76% of commission and fees (2021: 0.99% of
commission and fees)

Commission and fees was determined to be the key driver
since it is the key metric for a number of the users of the
financial statements. It is the best metric to show the
growth of the group and is also the metric given the
highest prominence in the strategic report.


0.79% of Parent company net assets (2021: 0.79% of
Parent company net assets). We apply a materiality cap
for the parent company to be lower than the group at
90%. (2021: 90%)

Net assets was determined to be the materiality
benchmark given the activities of the company. A nontrading holding company with principal activities being to
hold intercompany subordinated debt and investment in
subsidiaries.

6.2 Performance materiality
We set performance materiality at a level lower than materiality to reduce the probability that, in
aggregate, uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceed the materiality for the financial statements
as a whole.

Group financial statements Parent company financial statements

Basis and
rationale for

materiality


60% (2021: 60%) of group materiality 60% (2021: 60%) of parent company
materiality

In determining performance materiality, we considered our risk assessment which included
our assessment of the group’s overall control environment. The group is still growing
quickly and has a developing control environment, as such we decided to not rely on
controls over a number of business processes and instead conduct a substantive audit.


6.3 Error reporting threshold
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in
excess of £0.45m (2021 £0.45m), as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted
reporting on qualitative grounds. We also report to the Audit Committee on disclosure matters that we
identified when assessing the overall presentation of the financial statements.

 Report on the audit of the financial statements

 7 An overview of the scope of our Audit

7.1 Identification and scoping of components

Our group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the group and its environment, including
group-wide controls, and assessing the risks of material misstatement at the group level.
Given the number of components and operating locations within the group, we assessed the extent of
audit work required to be performed to give appropriate coverage for the purposes of the group financial
statement audit. Our approach considered revenue contribution to the group result as a primary measure
of financial significance and scope, and insurance debtors as a secondary balance sheet measure given the
significance of the insurance debtors balance to the operational activities of wider group. Coverage
obtained on this basis was 77% of revenue (2021: 82%) and 73% of insurance debtors.
Of the group’s 24 significant components, 7 were subjected to full scope audits of the financial information
of the component and 17 subjected to an audit of one or more account balances, classes of transactions or
disclosures. Audits were performed at levels of materiality lower than group materiality with a range of
£2.2m to £3.0m.
Those subjected to an audit of one or more account balances, classes of transactions or disclosures are not
individually financially significant enough to require full scope audit of the financial information of the
component for group purposes, but did present specific areas of risk which needed to be addressed.
At the group level we also tested the consolidation process and carried out analytical procedures to
confirm our conclusion that there were no significant risks of material misstatement of the aggregated
financial information of the remaining components not subject to a full audit.

###### INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF ARDONAGH MIDCO 2 PLC

 Report on the audit of the financial statements

7.2 Our consideration of the control environment

We obtained an understanding of the control environment, including the significant underlying IT systems.
We planned not to rely on the general IT controls or application controls, as the group is still growing
quickly and has a developing control environment. We obtained an understanding of the relevant controls
relating to the financial reporting environment and the major revenue streams.

7.3 Our consideration of climate-related risks

As part of the audit, we made enquiries of management to understand the process they have adopted to
assess the potential impact of climate change on the financial statements. Management considers that the
impact of climate change does not give rise to a material financial statement impact. We used our
knowledge of the Group to evaluate management’s assessment. We also considered the consistency of
the disclosures in relation to climate change made in the other information within the annual report with
the financial statements and our knowledge from our audit.
7.4 Working with other auditors

Work on Arachas Corporate Brokers (Ireland) was subject to a full scope audit and Glennon (Ireland),
Resilium (Australia), MDS (Brazil) and MDS (Portugal) were subject to specified audit procedures. This was
undertaken by Deloitte overseas component audit teams.
We directed and supervised the component teams in the performance of their work through providing
detailed instructions setting out the work to be performed, having regular conference calls with the team
throughout the audit and by performing a review of their audit working papers over a video conference.

###### 8 Other information

The other information comprises the information included in the annual report, other than the financial
statements and our auditor’s report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information
contained within the annual report.
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent
otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other
information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the
course of the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to
determine whether this gives rise to a material misstatement in the financial statements themselves. If,
based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other
information, we are required to report that fact.


We have nothing to report in this regard.

###### INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF ARDONAGH MIDCO 2 PLC

 Report on the audit of the financial statements

 9 Responsibilities of directors

As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement, the directors are responsible for the
preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for
such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial
statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group’s and the
parent company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going
concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the
group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

###### 10 Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that
includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an
audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the
aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the
basis of these financial statements.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the FRC’s
[website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor’s report.](http://www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities)

###### 11 Extent to which the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud

Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design
procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of
irregularities, including fraud. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities,
including fraud is detailed below.

11.1 Identifying and assessing potential risks related to irregularities
In identifying and assessing risks of material misstatement in respect of irregularities, including fraud and
non-compliance with laws and regulations, we considered the following:

  - the nature of the industry and sector, control environment and business performance including
the design of the group’s remuneration policies, key drivers for directors’ remuneration, bonus
levels and performance targets;

  - results of our enquiries of management and the audit committee about their own identification
and assessment of the risks of irregularities;


-----

###### INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF ARDONAGH MIDCO 2 PLC

 Report on the audit of the financial statements

  - any matters we identified having obtained and reviewed the group’s documentation of their
policies and procedures relating to:

`o` identifying, evaluating and complying with laws and regulations and whether they were aware
of any instances of non-compliance;

`o` detecting and responding to the risks of fraud and whether they have knowledge of any
actual, suspected or alleged fraud;

`o` the internal controls established to mitigate risks of fraud or non-compliance with laws and
regulations;

  - the matters discussed among the audit engagement team including significant component audit
teams and relevant internal specialists, including tax, valuations, IT, and industry specialists
regarding how and where fraud might occur in the financial statements and any potential
indicators of fraud.

As a result of these procedures, we considered the opportunities and incentives that may exist within the
organisation for fraud and identified the greatest potential for fraud in the following areas: goodwill
impairment, acquisition accounting under IFRS 3 business combinations – Ed Broking Group Limited, Besso
Insurance Group Limited, presentation of alternative performance measures and revenue recognition –
cut off in Specialty division. In common with all audits under ISAs (UK), we are also required to perform
specific procedures to respond to the risk of management override.

We also obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory framework that the group operates in,
focusing on provisions of those laws and regulations that had a direct effect on the determination of
material amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The key laws and regulations we considered
in this context included the UK Companies Act.

In addition, we considered provisions of other laws and regulations that do not have a direct effect on the
financial statements but compliance with which may be fundamental to the group’s ability to operate or to
avoid a material penalty. These included the group’s FCA permissions and compliance with FCA client
assets regulations.

11.2 Audit response to risks identified
As a result of performing the above, we identified acquisition accounting under IFRS 3 business
combinations – Ed Broking Group Limited, Besso Insurance Group Limited, presentation of alternative
performance measures, and goodwill impairment as key audit matters related to the potential risk of fraud.
The key audit matters section of our report explains the matters in more detail and also describes the
specific procedures we performed in response to those key audit matters.


-----

###### INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF ARDONAGH MIDCO 2 PLC

 Report on the audit of the financial statements

In addition to the above, our procedures to respond to risks identified included the following:

  - reviewing the financial statement disclosures and testing to supporting documentation to assess
compliance with provisions of relevant laws and regulations described as having a direct effect on
the financial statements;

  - enquiring of management, the audit committee and in-house legal counsel concerning actual and
potential litigation and claims;

  - performing analytical procedures to identify any unusual or unexpected relationships that may
indicate risks of material misstatement due to fraud;

  - reading minutes of meetings of those charged with governance, reviewing internal audit reports
and reviewing correspondence with the FCA;

  - in relation to the cut off risk in Specialty division revenue: we analysed the divisional vs budget
performance throughout the year, comparing to market expectations to identify any significant
differences on the basis of known rate inflation across the market. We also obtained the
December 2022 and January 2023 revenue listings and assessed whether revenue was correctly
being recognised in each period.

  - in addressing the risk of fraud through management override of controls, testing the
appropriateness of journal entries and other adjustments; assessing whether the judgements
made in making accounting estimates are indicative of a potential bias; and evaluating the
business rationale of any significant transactions that are unusual or outside the normal course of
business.
We also communicated relevant identified laws and regulations and potential fraud risks to all
engagement team members including internal specialists and significant component audit teams, and
remained alert to any indications of fraud or non-compliance with laws and regulations throughout the
audit.

###### Report on other legal and regulatory requirements

 12 Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006


In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:



- the information given in the strategic report and the directors’ report for the period for which the
financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and

- the strategic report and the directors’ report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal
requirements.

domiciled in the UK. The address of its registered office is 2 Minster Court, Mincing Lane, London, EC3R 7PD. The principal business
activities of the Company and its subsidiaries are described in the Strategic Report.

**2** **Basis of preparation**

The consolidated financial statements comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (the Group) and have been prepared in
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the United Kingdom (UK-adopted IFRS) and the
Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.

The consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds sterling (£), being the functional currency of the company, and in
thousands unless otherwise stated.

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified to use a different
measurement basis where necessary to comply with or permitted by IFRS.

Going concern

The financial statements of the Group set out on pages 48 to 54 have been prepared on the basis that the Group is a going
concern. At 31 December 2022, the Group had net liabilities of £111.4m (2021: net assets of £82.2m (restated)) and net current
assets of £312.0m (2021: £366.6m (restated)). The Group reported an operating profit of £76.5m (2021: £102.7m) for the year
ended 31 December 2022, net cash inflows from operating activities of £171.1m (2021: £688.5m), net decrease/(increase) in
cash and cash equivalents of £118.0m (2021: £754.1m). Available cash of £269.6m (2021: £411.3m) was reported on 31
December 2022.

The Directors have assessed the Group’s financial position and its ability to meet its obligations as and when they fall due. In
making the going concern assessment the Directors have taken into account the following:

  - The Group’s capital structure, operations and liquidity.

  - Base case and stressed cash flow forecasts over the calendar years 2023 and 2024.

  - The impact on the base case and stressed cashflow forecasts arising from material acquisitions and capital injections
subsequent to year end.

  - The principal risks facing the Group. and its systems of risk management and internal control.

  - The Group’s capital management, among other things, aims to ensure that it meets financial covenants attached to its
interest-bearing loans and borrowings. There have been no breaches of the financial covenants of any interest-bearing
loans and borrowing in the reporting period.

  - Post year-end operating results and cashflows of the Group continue to be positive.

Key assumptions that the Directors have reflected in the base case cash flow forecasts include that:

  - The Group will continue to benefit from a £191.5m Revolving Credit Facility that is not drawn at the date of this report.

  - Client retention and renewal rates remain robust, despite the current economic uncertainty, as the 2022 trading
performance continues to demonstrate resilience across the Group.

  - Interest costs are modelled using current forward interest and FX rates (other than where interest rates on debt have
been fixed through interest rate swaps).

**2** **Basis of preparation (continued)**

Key stress scenarios that the Directors have considered include cumulative stresses to the base plan as a result of:

  - Shortfalls in base case projected income throughout 2023 and 2024.

  - Deterioration in base case cash conversion rates over and above the shortfalls in income.

  - An inflationary cost increase of 2% over the base case assumptions.

  - Additional interest costs on the term and CAR debt facilities based on forward interest rate expectations.

  - Mitigating actions within management control including delayed capital expenditure, a reduction in discretionary spend
and measured reductions in employee headcount and remuneration.

The Directors have also modelled reverse stress scenarios, including assessing those that result in a default on the Group’s term
debt facilities that would require a technical repayment obligation and those that would exhaust available liquidity. The stresses
needed for these outcomes to happen significantly exceed the key stress scenarios above and the Directors consider such
conditions to be a remote possibility. Other mitigations which may be possible in the stress scenarios but have not been included
in the analysis include seeking shareholder support, securitising premium receivables and further incremental and more
prolonged cost reductions.

The Directors continue to consider the wider operational and financial consequences and ramifications of global political and
economic tensions (including related to the Ukrainian conflict, foreign exchange rates, inflation and increasing interest rates). In
particular:

  - Insurance broking is a resilient and defensive market, which has historically had limited impact from past economic or
capital market downturns. The Group is highly diversified and not unduly exposed to a single carrier, customer or market
sector.

  - Although economic developments remain fluid, the stress testing demonstrates the Group’s financial resilience and
operating flexibility.

  - As a result of Russia invading Ukraine, we have seen significant new sanctions legislation from a range of legislators
(including the US, EU and UK), with newly sanctioned entities and individuals, and new (or wider in scope) sectoral
sanctions targeting Russia (and Belarus). The Ardonagh Group has no appetite for potential breaches of applicable
sanctions regimes and applies appropriate controls including automated screening of clients against relevant sanctions
lists. We continue to actively monitor the situation as it develops and will respond accordingly as new sanctions are
enacted.

  - The Group continues to monitor the risk of cyber-attacks, but the Group has not identified any significant security risks
during the period ended 31 December 2022.

Following the assessment of the Group’s financial position and its ability to meet its obligations as and when they fall due,
including the further potential financial implications of economic uncertainty included in stress tests, the Directors are not aware
of any material uncertainties that cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**3** **Accounting policies**

The summary of significant accounting policies adopted by the Group for the consolidated financial statements are listed below
and include new standards effective from 8 December 2021 as described in ‘New standards, amendments and interpretations
adopted by the Group’ (section (q) below).

**(a) Basis of consolidation**

The Group consolidates those investees that it is deemed to control, referred to as subsidiaries. The Group has control over an
investee if all three of the following are met: (i) it has power over the investee, (ii) it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable
returns from its involvement with the investee, and (iii) it has ability to use its power over the investee to affect the amount of
its own returns. The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered
when assessing whether the Group controls another entity.

Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. The assets, liabilities, profits and losses
of the subsidiary are added line by line to those of the Group.

Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains and losses on transactions between Group companies are eliminated.

Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the
Group.

Accounting for business combinations
The Group uses the acquisition method of accounting to account for business combinations. The consideration transferred for
the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair value of the assets transferred, the liabilities assumed, and the equity interests issued by
the Group. The consideration transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration
arrangement. Identifiable assets acquired, and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed, in a business combination are
measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. The Group does not recognise a contingent asset at the acquisition
date. The Group recognises any non-controlling interest in the acquiree at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of
the acquiree’s net assets.

Acquisition-related costs, except costs to issue debt or equity securities, are expensed as incurred.

If a business combination is achieved in stages, the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree is re-measured to
fair value at the acquisition date through profit or loss.

Some acquisitions involve a put and/or call option. A put option gives the seller the right to require the Group to acquire its
shareholdings in the acquiree at a future date. A call option gives the Group the right to require the seller to sell its shareholdings
in the acquiree to the Group. The put and/or call options are usually exercisable within specified time periods. The exercise price
of the options is usually based on a multiple of EBITDA, net of the net debt of the acquiree for the financial year that immediately
precedes the financial year in which the option is exercised. The Group recognises a financial liability where there is a put option,
at an amount corresponding to the present value of the option price (the redemption amount), and that liability is classified as
‘Share buyout’ in the financial statements.

Subsequent changes to the fair value of deferred consideration, contingent consideration or the share buyout balance are
recognised in accordance with IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ in profit or loss, unless the changes occur during the ‘measurement
period’ of up to one year following the acquisition date and are the result of additional information that the acquirer has obtained
after the acquisition date about facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date. Contingent consideration that is
classified as equity is not re-measured, and its subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity.

###### FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**3** **Accounting policies (continued)**

Disposal of subsidiaries
Where the Group disposes of its controlling interest in a subsidiary, the assets and liabilities are derecognised along with any
related non-controlling interest and other components of equity. Any resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss. Any
interest retained in the former subsidiary is measured at fair value when control is lost.

Goodwill
Goodwill is initially measured as the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred and of the non-controlling interest
over the fair value of the net of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If goodwill is negative (i.e. a shortfall
instead of an excess), it is recognised in profit or loss.

Goodwill acquired in the period represents expected synergies from combining operations of the acquiree and the Group, and
intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition.

Goodwill is tested annually for impairment and is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Gains and losses on the
disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold. Goodwill is allocated to cash generating
units for the purposes of impairment testing.

Transactions with non-controlling interests
Transactions with non-controlling interests that do not result in the loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions.

**(b) Investments in associates and joint ventures**

Associates
An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence and that is neither a subsidiary nor an interest in a joint
arrangement. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but
is not control nor joint control over those policies.

The results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in the consolidated financial statements as a single line in each
of the statement of financial position and the statement of profit or loss using the equity method of accounting. The consolidated
statement of financial position therefore includes investment in associates measured at cost as adjusted for post-acquisition
changes in the Group’s economic share of the net assets of the associate, less any impairment in the value of the investment, but
the carrying amount cannot fall below zero. The consolidated income statement includes a share of the profit or loss of the
associate.

Joint arrangements
The Group applies IFRS 11 ‘Joint Arrangements’ to all joint arrangements. Investments in joint arrangements are, as required by
IFRS 11, classified as either joint operations or joint ventures, depending on the contractual rights and obligations of each
investor. The Group has assessed the nature of its joint arrangements and has determined them to be joint ventures. Joint
ventures are accounted for using the equity method, in a similar manner to associates.

###### FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**3** **Accounting policies (continued)**

**(c) Intangible assets**

Customer relationships
Customer relationship intangible assets are recognised on a business combination because the acquirer is able to benefit from
selling future new business through existing relationships. Their fair value is calculated as the sum of the present value of
projected cash flows in excess of returns on contributory assets over the life of the relationship with the customers. These assets
are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of between 5 and 10 years, which is estimated by reference
to the history of the relationships and levels of attrition.

Distribution network
Distribution network intangible assets are recognised on a business combination because the acquirer is able to benefit from
already established distribution channels. Their fair value is calculated as the sum of the present value of projected future cash
flows generated by existing distribution channels. These assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful
lives of 10 years, which is estimated by reference to the history of the relationships and levels of attrition.

Brand
Brand intangible assets are recognised on a business combination because they are separable or arise from contractual or other
legal rights. Their fair value is calculated as the sum of the present value of projected royalty payments that would be paid to
license the right to use the brand. These assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of between
1 and 10 years, which considers the Group’s track record of retaining brands and experience of the insurance broking market.

Computer software
Computer software is recognised when purchased separately, when acquired as part of a business combination, or when
internally-generated. The fair value of computer software that is purchased separately is calculated by reference to the amount
paid. The fair value of computer software that is acquired as part of a business combination is calculated using the depreciated
replacement cost or relief from royalty approach. The fair value of internally-generated computer software is calculated as
described below. These assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life of 4 years.

Internally-generated computer software and assets under construction (unless acquired on a business combination)
Expenditure on research activities is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.

An internally-generated intangible asset arising from the development of computer software is recognised if, and only if, all the
following conditions have been demonstrated:

  - the technical feasibility of completing the asset so that it will be available for use or sale;

  - the intention to complete the asset and to use or sell it;

  - the ability to use or sell the asset;

  - how the asset will generate future economic benefits;

  - the availability of adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the
asset; and

  - the ability to measure reliably the expenditure attributable to the asset during its development.

The amount initially recognised is the sum of the expenditure incurred from the date when the intangible asset first meets the
recognition criteria listed above and is classified as an asset under construction. Where no internally-generated intangible asset
can be recognised, development expenditure is recognised in profit or loss in the period in which it is incurred.

Internally-generated intangible assets are not amortised in the period subsequent to initial recognition but before they are ready
for use. Amortisation commences when they are ready for use as intended by management. They are then reported at cost less
accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, on the same basis as intangible assets that are acquired
separately. Internally-generated intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life of 4 years.

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**3** **Accounting policies (continued)**

Intellectual property
Intellectual property assets include a bespoke database and online platform. These assets are amortised on a straight-line basis
over their estimated useful life of 4 years.

Derecognition of intangible assets
An intangible asset is derecognised on disposal, or when no future economic benefits are expected from use or disposal. Gains
or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset, measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and
the carrying amount of the asset, are recognised in profit or loss when the asset is derecognised.

Impairment of assets
Intangible assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment. Assets
that are subject to amortisation or depreciation are reviewed for impairment at each statement of financial position date or
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is
recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the
higher of an asset’s fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. If it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of
an individual asset, the recoverable amount of the ‘cash generating unit’ to which the asset belongs is determined, being the
lowest level for which there are separately identifiable cash flows.

Any impairment charges arising from the review of the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets are, where material,
disclosed separately on the face of the consolidated income statement.

**(d) Depreciation**

Assets are stated at their net book value (historical cost less accumulated depreciation). Depreciation is calculated to write off
the cost of such assets on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. At the reporting date, the Group’s principal rates
of depreciation were as follows:

Freehold buildings - over 50 years (except integral features which are over 20 years)
Leasehold improvements - over the remaining life of the lease
Furniture and equipment - over 4 years
Computer equipment - over 4 years
Fixtures and fittings - over 4 years
Motor vehicles - over 4 years

The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each reporting period.
Property, plant and equipment is derecognised on disposal, or when no future economic benefits are expected from use or
disposal. Gains or losses arising from derecognition of property, plant and equipment, measured as the difference between the
net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset, are recognised in profit or loss when the asset is derecognised.

###### FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**3** **Accounting policies (continued)**

**(e) Leases**

The Group accounts for lease and non-lease components in a contract as a single lease component.

Right-of-use assets
The Group recognises right-of-use assets at the commencement date of the lease (i.e. the date the underlying asset is available
for use). Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and are adjusted
for certain remeasurements of the lease liabilities. The cost of right-of-use assets includes the amount of lease liabilities
recognised, initial direct costs incurred, lease payments made at or before the commencement date of the lease less any lease
incentives received, plus the estimated costs of restoring the underlying asset to the condition required by the terms of the lease.
Unless the Group is reasonably certain to obtain ownership of the leased asset at the end of the lease term, the recognised rightof-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the estimated useful life and the lease term. Right-ofuse assets are subject to impairment.

Lease liabilities
At the commencement date of the lease, the Group recognises lease liabilities measured at the present value of lease payments
to be made over the lease term. The lease payments include fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments) less any
lease incentives receivable, variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, and amounts expected to be paid under
residual value guarantees. The lease payments also include the exercise price of a purchase option reasonably certain to be
exercised by the Group and payments of penalties for terminating a lease if the lease term reflects the Group exercising the
option to terminate. The variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognised as an expense in the
period on which the event or condition that triggers the payment occurs.

In calculating the present value of lease payments, the Group uses the incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement
date if the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable, which is generally the case. After the commencement
date, the amount of lease liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of interest and it is reduced for the lease payments made.
In addition, the carrying amount of lease liabilities is remeasured if there is a modification, a change in the lease term, a change
in the in-substance fixed lease payments or a change in the assessment to purchase the underlying asset.

Leases of low value assets
The Group elects on a lease-by-lease basis whether to apply the lease of low-value assets exemption to non-property leases that
are considered to be of low value (i.e. below £5,000). Where the exemption is applied, lease payments on leases of low-value
assets are recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

Subleases
The Group does not undertake arrangements as a lessor other than as a sublessor. When the Group is a sublessor, it classifies
the sublease as a finance lease if the sublease transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the asset
that is the subject of the sublease, namely the right-of-use asset arising from the head lease. The sublease is otherwise classified
as an operating lease.

###### FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**3** **Accounting policies (continued)**

**(f) Financial instruments**

Recognition and initial measurement
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the
financial instrument, and they are measured initially at fair value. Transaction costs arising on the issue of a financial asset or
financial liability are accounted for as follows:

  - Transaction costs are added to or deducted from the fair value of the financial asset or financial liability if they are directly
attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset or financial liability, respectively, and if the financial asset is measured
at fair value through other comprehensive income or if the financial asset or financial liability, respectively, is measured
at amortised cost.

  - Transaction costs are recognised immediately in profit or loss if they are directly attributable to the issue of a financial
asset or financial liability at fair value through profit or loss, or if they are not directly attributable to the issue of a financial
asset or financial liability.

Derecognition
Financial assets are derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire, or the Group
transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which substantially all of the risks and rewards of
ownership of the financial asset are transferred.

On derecognition of a financial asset measured at amortised cost, the difference between the asset's carrying amount and the
sum of the consideration received and receivable is recognised in profit or loss. On derecognition of an investment in an equity
instrument which the Group has elected on initial recognition to measure at fair value through other comprehensive income, the
cumulative gain or loss previously accumulated in equity is not reclassified to profit or loss but is included in retained earnings.

A financial liability is derecognised when it is extinguished, discharged, cancelled or expires. The difference between the carrying
value of the financial liability and the consideration paid and payable, including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities
assumed, is recognised in profit or loss. Where an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on
substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is
treated as a derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability.

Offsetting
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset, and the net amount presented in the statement of financial position when, and
only when, the Group currently has a legally enforceable right to set off the amounts and it intends either to settle them on a
net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

Classification and subsequent measurement of financial assets
The Group classifies its financial assets in the following measurement categories:

  - Amortised cost;

  - Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI); or

  - Fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL).
All recognised financial assets are subsequently measured in their entirety at either amortised cost or fair value, depending on
their classification.


-----

###### FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**3** **Accounting policies (continued)**

Financial assets classified as amortised cost
Financial assets that meet the following conditions are classified and subsequently measured at amortised cost:

  - the financial asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual
cash flows; and

  - the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal
and interest on the principal amount outstanding.

The amortised cost of a financial asset is the amount at which the financial asset is measured at initial recognition minus the
principal repayments, plus the cumulative amortisation using the effective interest method of any difference between that initial
amount and the maturity amount, adjusted for any loss allowance.

The Group’s financial assets measured at amortised cost include trade and other receivables (except for certain other receivables
measured at FVTPL, see below), advances to related parties, cash and cash equivalents and certain other financial assets.

The Group’s trade receivables do not generally have a significant financing component, so their transaction (invoiced) price is
considered to be their amortised cost.

Insurance brokers act as agents in placing the insurable risks of their clients with insurers and, as such, are not usually liable as
principal for amounts arising from such transactions. In recognition of this relationship, debtors from insurance broking
transactions are not, in general, included as an asset of the Group. Other than the receivable for fees and commissions earned
on a transaction, recognition of the insurance transaction does not, in general, occur until the Group receives cash in respect of
premiums or claims, at which time a corresponding liability is established in favour of the insurer or the client. An exception
exists in relation to funded premium and claim items whereby the Group has a legal obligation to make good any shortfall to
client monies in the event of default.

In certain circumstances, the Group advances premiums, refunds or claims to insurers or clients prior to collection. These
advances are reflected in the consolidated statement of financial position as part of trade receivables.

Financial assets classified as FVTOCI
Financial assets are classified and subsequently measured at FVTOCI if they meet the criteria to be classified at amortised cost
except that the business model is to sell financial assets as well as to hold financial assets to collect contractual cash flows.

The Group may also irrevocably elect to classify and subsequently measure equity investments at FVTOCI. Gains and losses on
these equity instruments are never recycled to profit or loss. Dividend income from equity instruments measured at FVTOCI is
recognised in profit or loss as part of investment income when the right to payment has been established (provided that it is
probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and that the amount of income can be measured reliably), except
when the Group benefits from such proceeds as a recovery of part of the cost of the instrument, in which case, such gains are
recorded in other comprehensive income. The right to payment is established on the ex-dividend date for listed equity securities,
and usually on the date when shareholders approve the dividend for unlisted equity securities. Equity instruments at FVTOCI are
not subject to an impairment assessment.

The Group has designated all of its unlisted equity investments as at FVTOCI, because these investments were on initial
recognition held as long-term strategic investments that are not expected to be sold in the short to medium term.


-----

###### FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**3** **Accounting policies (continued)**

Financial assets classified as FVTPL
Financial assets that do not meet the criteria for being measured at amortised cost or FVTOCI are measured at FVTPL. Specifically:

  - Investments in equity instruments are classified as FVTPL, unless the Group designates an equity investment as FVTOCI
on initial recognition.

  - Debt instruments (including receivables) that do not meet the amortised cost criteria or the FVTOCI criteria are classified
as FVTPL.

Financial assets classified as FVTPL are recorded in the statement of financial position at fair value. Changes in fair value are
recorded in profit and loss to the extent they are not part of a designated hedging relationship.

The Group has not designated any debt investments that meet the amortised cost or FVTOCI criteria as being measured at FVTPL.

Other financial assets measured at FVTPL include convertible loan receivables, and receivables recognised on a business
combination in relation to the Group’s right to variable consideration on rolling contracts with customers for which the
performance obligation was satisfied prior to the acquisition. These financial assets are not classified as amortised cost or FVTOCI
because their cash flows do not represent solely payments of principal and interest.

Foreign exchange gains and losses
The carrying amount of financial assets that are denominated in a foreign currency is determined in that foreign currency and
translated at the spot rate at the end of each reporting period. Specifically:

  - for equity instruments measured at FVTOCI, exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income; and

  - for all other financial assets that are not part of a designated hedging relationship, exchange differences are recognised
in profit or loss in the other operating costs line item.

Reclassifications
Financial assets are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition. They would only be reclassified if the Group were to
change its business model for managing its financial assets, in which case the affected financial assets would be reclassified
following that change.

Impairment of financial assets
The Group assesses, on a forward-looking basis, the expected credit losses (ECL) associated with its financial assets carried at
amortised cost. The Group recognises a loss allowance for such losses at each reporting date.

The Group recognises lifetime ECL for trade and other receivables. The expected credit losses on these financial assets are
estimated using a provision matrix based on the Group’s historical credit loss experience, adjusted for factors that are specific to
the debtors and by scalar factors to reflect differences between economic conditions during the period over which the historical
data was collected versus current conditions and the Group’s view of economic conditions over the expected lives of the
receivables, including the time value of money where appropriate. Scalar factors are typically based on GDP and unemployment
rate forecasts.

For all other financial instruments, the Group recognises lifetime ECL when there has been a significant increase in credit risk
since initial recognition. If, on the other hand, the credit risk on the financial instrument has not increased significantly since
initial recognition, the Group measures the loss allowance for that financial instrument at an amount equal to 12 months ECL.


-----

###### FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**3** **Accounting policies (continued)**

The Group assumes that the credit risk on a financial instrument has not increased significantly since initial recognition if the
financial instrument is determined to have low credit risk at the reporting date. A financial instrument is determined to have low
credit risk if (i) the financial instrument has a low risk of default, (ii) the borrower has a strong capacity to meet its contractual
cash flow obligations in the near term, and (iii) adverse changes in economic and business conditions in the longer term may, but
will not necessarily, reduce the ability of the borrower to fulfil its contractual cash flow obligations.

All cash and cash equivalents are assessed to have low credit risk at each reporting date as they are held with reputable banks
and financial institution counterparties with, wherever possible, a minimum single A credit rating from both Moody’s and S&P.
The Group measures the loss allowance for such assets at an amount equal to 12 months ECL.

ECL is estimated as the difference between all contractual cash flows that are due to the Group in accordance with the contract
and all the cash flows that the Group expects to receive, discounted at the original effective interest rate.

Lifetime ECL represents the expected credit losses that will result from all possible default events over the expected life of a
financial instrument. 12 months ECL represents the portion of lifetime ECL that is expected to result from default events on a
financial instrument that are possible within 12 months after the reporting date.

Lifetime ECL is measured on a collective basis to cater for cases where evidence of significant increases in credit risk at the
individual instrument level may not yet be available.

Definition of default
The Group considers the following as constituting an event of default for internal credit risk management purposes as historical
experience indicates that receivables that meet either of the following criteria are generally not recoverable:

  - when there is a breach of financial covenants by the counterparty; or

  - information developed internally or obtained from external sources indicates that the debtor is unlikely to pay its
creditors, including the Group, in full.

Irrespective of the above analysis, the Group considers that default has occurred when a financial asset is more than 90 days past
due unless the Group has reasonable and supportable information to demonstrate that a longer or shorter default criterion is
more appropriate.

Credit-impaired financial assets
A financial asset is credit-impaired when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows
of that financial asset have occurred. Evidence that a financial asset is credit-impaired includes observable data about the
following events:

  - significant financial difficulty of the counterparty;

  - a breach of contract, such as a default or past due event;

  - the lender(s) of the counterparty, for economic or contractual reasons relating to the counterparty’s financial difficulty,
having granted to the counterparty a concession that the lender(s) would not otherwise consider;

  - it is becoming probable that the counterparty will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation; or

  - the disappearance of an active market for that financial asset because of the financial difficulties.

Write-off policy
The Group writes off a trade receivable when there is information indicating that the debtor is in severe financial difficulty and
there is no realistic prospect of recovery, e.g. when the debtor has been placed under liquidation or has entered into bankruptcy
proceedings, or when the trade receivables are over two years past due, whichever occurs earlier. A write-off constitutes a
derecognition event. Financial assets written off may still be subject to enforcement activities under the Group’s recovery
procedures, taking into account legal advice where appropriate. Any recoveries made are recognised in profit or loss.

Classification and subsequent measurement of financial liabilities
All financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method or at FVTPL.

Financial liabilities are classified and measured as FVTPL when (i) the financial liability is deferred consideration, contingent
consideration or a share buyout balance relating to a business combination to which IFRS 3 applies, or (ii) it is a derivative.

Financial liabilities at FVTPL are stated at fair value with any gains or losses arising on changes in fair value recognised in profit
or loss to the extent that they are not part of a designated hedging relationship. The net gain or loss recognised in profit or loss
incorporates any interest paid on the financial liabilities.

For financial liabilities that are denominated in a foreign currency that are not part of a designated hedging relationship, the
foreign exchange gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss.

The Group’s financial liabilities include borrowings, trade and other payables, derivatives, deferred consideration, contingent
consideration and a share buyout balance.

Borrowings
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for
at least 12 months after the statement of financial position date. Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of
transaction costs incurred. They are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.

Trade payables
Trade payables are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost.

Derivative financial instruments
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value at each
reporting date. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss immediately unless the derivative is designated and
effective as a hedging instrument, in which case the timing of the recognition in profit or loss depends on the nature of the hedge
relationship.

The fair values of various derivative financial instruments used for hedging purposes are disclosed in note 24 hedge accounting.
Movements in the cash flow hedging reserve in shareholders’ equity are included in the consolidated statement of changes in
equity.

Deferred consideration, contingent consideration and share buyout balance
The Group is party to consideration arrangements in the form of deferred consideration, contingent consideration and a share
buyout balance. Deferred consideration represents fixed or determinable amounts payable at a specified date in the future.
Contingent consideration is consideration that is contingent on a future event, usually the future performance of the acquired
business. Share buyout arises as a result of put options held by minority shareholders of acquired businesses. These liabilities are
recognised initially at their discounted present value and are remeasured at each reporting date. The discount unwind and the
remeasurement of these liabilities are recognised in profit or loss as finance cost.

Cash flow hedges
The Group enters into forward contracts to manage its exposure to foreign exchange rate risks. The Group also enters into
interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate risks. The Group designates these derivatives as cash flow hedges.
Where the Group identifies foreign currency borrowings for which changes in foreign exchange rates offset the Group’s exposure
to changes in cash flows associated with highly probable forecast transactions, such as forecast revenue denominated in that
foreign currency, the Group also designates such borrowings as cash flow hedges. In all cases these are hedges of a particular
risk associated with the cash flows of highly probable forecast transactions.

At the inception of such hedging transactions the Group documents whether the hedging instrument is effective in offsetting
changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, which is when the hedging relationships
meet all of the following hedge effectiveness requirements:

  - there is an economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument;

  - the effect of credit risk does not dominate the value changes that result from that economic relationship; and

  - the hedge ratio of the hedging relationship is the same as that resulting from the quantity of the hedged item that the
Group actually hedges and the quantity of the hedging instrument that the entity actually uses to hedge that quantity of
hedged item.

If a hedging relationship ceases to meet the hedge effectiveness requirement relating to the hedge ratio but the risk management
objective for that designated hedging relationship remains the same, the Group adjusts the hedge ratio of the hedging
relationship (i.e. rebalances the hedge) so that it meets the qualifying criteria again.

When a derivative or other financial instrument is designated as a cash flow hedging instrument, the effective portion of changes
in the fair value of such instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in other comprehensive
income and accumulated under the heading of cash flow hedging reserve. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of
the instrument that is recognised in other comprehensive income is limited to the cumulative change in fair value of the hedged
item, determined on a present value basis, from inception of the hedge. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is
recognised immediately in profit or loss and is included in finance costs for the derivatives that hedge borrowings and in other
operating costs for the instruments that hedge revenue.

Amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity are reclassified to profit or loss in the
periods when the hedged item affects profit or loss, included in the same line as that which the hedged item affects.

Furthermore, if the Group expects that some or all of the loss accumulated in other comprehensive income will not be recovered
in the future, that amount is immediately reclassified to profit or loss.

The Group discontinues hedge accounting only when the hedging relationship (or a part thereof) ceases to meet the qualifying
criteria (after rebalancing, if applicable). This includes instances when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or
exercised. The discontinuation is accounted for prospectively. Any gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income and
accumulated in equity at that time remains in equity and is reclassified to profit or loss when the forecast transaction is ultimately
recognised in profit or loss. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the gain or loss accumulated in equity is
recognised immediately in profit or loss.

Derivatives hedging borrowings
The Group’s risk management policy is to hedge against adverse fluctuations in interest rates by reducing its exposure to
variability in cash flows on the Group’s floating-rate borrowings to the extent that it is practicable and cost effective to do so.

Interest rate risk exposures are hedged by the Group using interest rate swap derivatives to offset the variability associated with
the variable rates on its floating-rate borrowings.

The Group uses the hypothetical derivative method to determine the changes in fair value of the hedged item. The Group
assesses hedge effectiveness by comparing the changes in fair value of a hypothetical derivative reflecting the terms of the
floating rate borrowing with the changes in fair value of the derivatives used to hedge the exposure.

The Group determines the hedge ratio by comparing the notional of the derivatives with the principal of the designated portion
of the borrowing. The Group has identified the following possible sources of ineffectiveness in these cash flow hedge
relationships:

  - The variable interest rate of the swap is not subject to a floor, and the borrowing from which the hedged items are
expected to flow are subject to a floor of 0.75%. Should the floor have an intrinsic value, this would trigger
ineffectiveness going forward.

  - The effect of the counterparty and the Group’s own credit risk on the fair value of the interest rate swap, which is not
reflected in the change in the fair value of the hedged items; and

  - The possibility of changes to the critical terms of the hedged items due to a refinancing or debt renegotiation such
that they no longer match those of the interest rate swap.

Derivatives hedging revenue
The Group’s policy is for the critical terms of the forward contracts to align with the hedged item. The Group determines the
existence of an economic relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item based on the currency, amount and
timing of their respective cash flows. The Group assesses whether the instrument designated in each hedging relationship is
expected to be and has been effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged item using the hypothetical derivative
method.

In these hedge relationships, the main sources of ineffectiveness are:

  - The effect of the counterparty and the Group’s own credit risk on the fair value of the forward contracts, which is not
reflected in the change in the fair value of the hedged cash flows attributable to the change in exchange rates;

  - The use of different discounting curves for the hedged item and the hedging instrument, because for the derivatives the
discounting curve used depends on collateralisation and the type of collateral used; and

  - Changes in the timing of the hedged transactions.

For the forward contracts hedging revenue, the Group designates the entire hedging instrument (i.e. the currency forward
inclusive of the forward element). Given the size of the notional, tenure and currency pairs involved in the currency forwards,
the forward points are not considered to be significant enough to warrant separation as costs of hedging and so are included in
the measurement of the hedged item.

Finance income and finance costs
The Group’s finance income and finance costs include:

  - Interest income

  - Interest expense

  - Interest on defined benefit pension schemes

  - Unwind of discount on provisions

  - Unwind of discount on financial assets or liabilities, including on lease liabilities and lease receivables

  - Unwind of discount and fair value remeasurement of deferred consideration, contingent consideration and the share
buyout balance

  - The net gain or loss reclassified from other comprehensive income to profit or loss in relation to derivatives hedging
borrowings

  - Gains and losses on convertible loan receivables

Interest income and expense are recognised using the effective interest method for debt instruments classified as amortised cost
and as FVTOCI.

**(g) Provisions for liabilities and charges**

A provision is recognised where there is a present obligation, whether legal or constructive, as a result of a past event for which
it is probable that a transfer of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reasonable estimate can be made
of the amount of the obligation.

The amount recognised as a provision is management’s best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present
obligation at the statement of financial position date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation.

Where appropriate the Group discounts provisions to their present value. The unwinding of the provision discounting is included
as an interest charge within finance costs in the income statement.

**(h) Share capital**

Ordinary shares are classified as equity, as are preference shares if the holder does not have a put option and if any dividends or
redemption date can be deferred indefinitely. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are
shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.

**(i) Revenue**

Revenue is measured based on the consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled in a contract with a customer (net of
refunds) and excludes amounts collected on behalf of third parties. The Group recognises revenue when it transfers control of a
service to a customer.

Commission and fees
Revenue includes commission and fees receivable by the Group. Commission and fees relate mainly to placement or underwriting
of policies on behalf of insurers or policyholders and are recognised at the later of policy inception date and when the policy
placement has been completed and confirmed.

The Group charges fees and retains a portion of the policy premiums as commission. Premiums are typically collected on an
annual basis, at or near contract inception (which could be up to 60 days from contract inception). In some cases, customers are
offered the option to pay in instalments or are directed to a third-party premium credit provider for which the Group is entitled
to additional consideration that is recognised at policy inception. Some of the policies are rolling until the customer cancels the
policy.

###### FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**3** **Accounting policies (continued)**

Post-placement performance obligations
The Group may also have post-placement obligations in contracts with customers, which mainly consist of claims services
associated with the claims life cycle, e.g. first notification, claims investigation, decision and settlement, supply chain
management, fraud investigation, field/loss adjusting services and management information, but which may also include other
performance obligations such as the provision of mid-term adjustments.

To the extent that commission and fees received (or receivable) relate to both placement and post-placement performance
obligations, a suitable proportion of income related to post-placement obligations is deferred based on the estimated standalone
selling prices of the performance obligations in the contract and is presented as a contract liability. Revenue for post-placement
obligations is recognised over the period of providing the services.

Variable consideration
The Group is a party to the following material arrangements where the consideration receivable by the Group is variable:

  - Trading deals – profit share arrangements and loss corridor arrangements:
Trading deals are arrangements with insurers which include incentives and penalties based on the performance of the
book of business. Revenue related to these arrangements is recognised on a best estimate basis, only to the extent that
it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognised will not occur (a
constraint).

Under some of these arrangements (e.g. profit share arrangements), an additional commission is earned from the insurer
based on the profit from the underlying book of business or the volume of policies placed. The estimated additional
commission is recognised as a contract asset and is reclassified to trade and other receivables when the underlying results
are determined. Some of the additional commissions may be provided in advance, in which case they can be subject to a
clawback. Advanced commission is recognised as a contract liability until the Group satisfies the underlying performance
obligations.

Under loss corridor arrangements, the commission received by the Group is subject to a clawback if a set loss ratio
exceeds an agreed threshold. When the threshold is exceeded, a payment calculated as a percentage of the loss (between
1% and 4% of the loss) is due to the insurer up to a maximum. Expected clawbacks under loss corridor arrangements are
recognised in trade and other payables.

Payment terms of the above arrangements vary across the Group and depend on the specific agreement with the insurer.
Because of the time required for policies to earn out and for claims to mature, final settlement of profit share and loss
corridor arrangements may take up to 2-3 years from the point at which the Group places a policy (i.e. satisfies its
performance obligation).

  - Cancellation rights:
Some contracts with customers include cancellation rights, whereby the consideration receivable by the Group is subject
to a clawback. If no claims are made under the policy, then cancellations usually entitle the policyholder to a proportional
refund of the consideration. When the effect is material, the Group adjusts the estimated consideration for the expected
clawback based on historical experience of average cancellations and recognises revenue only on the amount that is not
expected to be refunded. The Group reassesses at the end of the reporting period whether the estimated clawback needs
to be revisited. Amounts that are expected to be refunded for consideration that has been received or invoiced are
recognised in trade and other payables.

  - Rolling contracts:
Some policies placed by the Group are rolling until the customer cancels the policy. Revenue recognised on rolling
contracts (based on the expected consideration net of cancellations) is presented in contract assets until the
consideration is invoiced (except where acquired as part of a business combination, in which case it is presented in trade
and other receivables as a financial asset measured at fair value).

###### FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**3** **Accounting policies (continued)**

Other income
Other income includes;

  - Fair value gains and losses on financial assets at FVTPL that are recognised on a business combination in relation to the
Group’s right to variable consideration on rolling contracts with customers for which the performance obligation was
satisfied prior to the acquisition.

  - Rent receivable and service charges receivable in respect of sub-let properties.

  - Profit on termination of leases.

**(j) Contract costs**

Contract costs give rise to assets recognised in accordance with IFRS 15 which consist of:

  - Costs to fulfil – salary and other costs of customer-facing employees who undertake activities necessary to satisfy
anticipated contracts with the customer. The Group estimates the proportion of costs that are eligible to be capitalised
based on the time spent by customer-facing employees on relevant inception/renewal activities. Capitalised costs are
released to profit or loss on inception or renewal of the contract with the customer, which normally takes place within
one to three months of the reporting period.

  - Costs to obtain – incremental fees paid to distributors (usually aggregator websites) for obtaining new business. These
costs are amortised, on a systematic basis that is consistent with the transfer to the customer of the goods or services to
which the asset relates, over the average life of the relationship with the customer.

The Group utilises the practical expedient to recognise the incremental costs of obtaining a contract as an expense when incurred
if the amortisation period of the asset that the entity otherwise would have recognised is one year or less.

Contract costs are presented within ‘other assets’ when recognised in the statement of financial position.

**(k) Operating segments**

Under IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’, the Group determines and presents operating segments based on the information that is
reviewed by the Group Executive Committee, which is the Group’s chief operating decision maker. The operating segments
reflect the Group’s operational structure. Segments are reviewed and revised as necessary following structural changes within
the Group or acquisitions of new companies.

**(l) Employee benefits**

Pension costs
The Group operates a number of defined contribution pension schemes. A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under
which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity.

The Group has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions.

The costs of the Group’s defined contribution pension schemes are charged to the income statement in the period in which they
fall due.


-----

###### FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**3** **Accounting policies (continued)**

Long-Term Incentive Plans
The Group operates a number of Long-Term Incentive Plans (LTIPs), under which the Group receives services from employees as
consideration for cash settled incentives which vest over a number of years based on achievement against certain performance
measures and/or service conditions. The incentives are earned by participants in the relevant performance and/or service period
(the performance period) and they must remain in employment in order to be entitled to payment.

The Group recognises an expense in respect of LTIPs over the vesting period, which is deemed to commence when the Group
makes participants aware of their right to participate in the LTIP and ends on conclusion of the performance period.

Where an LTIP is payable in instalments the Group recognises an expense based on either (i) the staged vesting approach, or (ii)
the plan’s benefit formula, depending on the specific facts and circumstances of the relevant award. Where benefits are
materially higher in later years the expense is recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.

At the end of each reporting period the Group revises its estimate of the expected pay-out, and it recognises the impact of the
revision to the original estimate, if any, in the income statement with a corresponding adjustment to the related accrual or
prepayment (there can be a prepayment if an interim payment has been made subject to a clawback period) as relevant.

Defined benefit pension arrangements
The Group has defined benefit arrangements. The cost of providing benefits for these schemes is determined using the projected
unit credit method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at the end of each annual reporting period.

Remeasurements comprising actuarial gains and losses, and the return on plan assets (excluding interest income), including the
tax thereon, are recognised immediately in the statement of financial position with a charge or credit to other comprehensive
income in the period in which they occur. Remeasurements recognised in other comprehensive income are not reclassified.
Current service costs are recognised in profit or loss within salaries and associated expenses, as are any past service costs such
as those arising from curtailments or settlements. Gains or losses on settlement of a defined benefit plan are recognised when
the settlement occurs. Interest is calculated by applying a discount rate to the net defined benefit liability or asset and is
recognised within finance costs (note 7). Defined benefit costs are split into three categories:

  - Service costs, which includes current service cost and past service cost; and

  - Interest on the pension obligation; and

  - Remeasurement of net pension obligation, which includes:

     - The impact on the liabilities of changes in financial assumptions, which are based on market conditions at the
reporting date, and demographic assumptions, such as life expectancy, compared with those adopted at the start of
the period; and

     - The impact on the liabilities of actual experience being different to assumptions made at the start of the period; and

     - The return on plan assets above or below the interest income on those plan assets.

The net pension obligation (or pension surplus) recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position represents the
deficit (or surplus) in a defined benefit plan. Any surplus is limited to the present value of any economic benefits available in the
form of refunds from the plans or reductions in future contributions to the plans.

###### FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**3** **Accounting policies (continued)**

Share-based payments
The Group operates equity-settled and cash-settled share-based payment schemes. For equity-settled share-based payment
schemes, the fair value of the services received in exchange for the grant of the shares is recognised as an expense, measured
based on the grant date fair value of the shares and recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, which generally
depends on service and performance conditions being met. For cash-settled share-based payment schemes, the Group
recognises an expense and a corresponding liability over the vesting period based on the fair value of the shares at the reporting
date.

The shares issued under the schemes generally have no dividend or voting rights and cannot be sold. The shares of an equitysettled share-based payment scheme are normally convertible to ordinary shares of the Group on the occurrence of a
crystallisation event, being the earlier of a liquidity event, an Initial Public Offering (IPO) and a winding-up. The Group has the
option to repurchase the shares if an employee leaves the Group prior to the occurrence of a crystallisation event.

**(m) Foreign currencies**

The Group’s consolidated financial statements are presented in GBP, the Group’s presentation currency.

Foreign currency transactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions are converted into the functional currency of the respective Group entity, using the exchange rate
at the date of the transaction.

Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are converted into GBP using the exchange rate at the reporting
date, with differences recognised in profit or loss.

Non-monetary items are not retranslated at the reporting date and are measured at the historical rate (translated using the
exchange rates at the transaction date), except for non-monetary items measured at fair value which are translated using the
exchange rates at the date when fair value was determined.

Profits or losses arising from derivatives taken out to hedge foreign currency exposure are recognised in the income statement
unless such contracts are designated as cash flow hedges, in which case they are accounted for as described above in (f) Cash
flow hedges.

Foreign operations
On consolidation, the results and financial position of foreign subsidiaries and branches are translated into the presentation
currency of the Group from their functional currencies, i.e. the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity
operates. Assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries and branches are translated into GBP at the exchange rate at the reporting
date. Income and expenses are translated into GBP at average exchange rates. The impact of these currency translations is
recorded in other comprehensive income and recognised in the foreign currency translation reserve in equity.

**(n) Taxation**

Current tax
Current tax is recognised for the amount of tax payable in respect of the taxable profit for the current or past reporting periods
using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.

Deferred tax
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of taxable temporary differences at the reporting date (except in relation to goodwill or a
transaction which is not a business combination and does not affect profit nor taxable profit). Deferred tax assets are only
recognised to the extent that it is probable they will be recovered against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or against future
taxable profits. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are only offset if there is a legally enforceable right to set off
current tax assets against current tax liabilities, and if they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on the
same taxable entity or on different taxable entities which intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or to
realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.

The tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in profit or loss, except that a change
attributable to an item of income or expense recognised as other comprehensive income is also recognised directly in other
comprehensive income. Similarly, income tax is recognised directly to equity if it relates to items that are recognised directly to
equity.

**(o) Dividend distribution**

Dividends proposed or declared after the statement of financial position date are not recognised as a liability at the reporting
date. Final dividends are recognised as a charge to equity once approved, and interim dividends are recognised once paid.

**(p) Discontinued operations**

A disposal group qualifies as a discontinued operation if it is a component of an entity (which will have been a cash-generating
unit or group of cash-generating units) that either has been disposed of, or it is classified as held for sale, and:

  - it represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations; or

  - it is part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations;
or

  - it is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale.

Discontinued operations, if there are any, are excluded from the results of continuing operations and are presented as a single
amount in ‘total comprehensive profit or loss for the period attributable to discontinued operations’ in the income statement.

**(q) New standards, amendments and interpretations adopted by the Group**

Several amendments to standards are mandatorily effective for annual periods beginning on 1 January 2022. None of these had
a material effect on the Group’s consolidated financial statements.

**(r) Application of new and revised International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)**

There are no standards, amendments to standards or interpretations which are not yet effective and that are expected to
materially impact the Group’s consolidated financial statements.

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**4** **Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty**

Estimates and judgements used in preparing the financial statements are continually evaluated and are based on historical
experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable. The resulting accounting
estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results.

The estimates and assumptions that have a significant effect on the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities are discussed below.

**Key sources of estimation uncertainty**
**Impairment of assets**

The Group tests annually whether goodwill and other assets that have indefinite useful lives have suffered any impairment. Other
assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset
may exceed its recoverable amount. The last annual impairment test was performed as at 1 October 2022.

An impairment test of an asset or cash-generating unit (or group of cash-generating units) is performed by comparing its carrying
amount with its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value in
use, where its value in use is the present value of its future cash flows. An impairment test requires the application of significant
judgement because it relies on key assumptions, including forecast cash flows, a discount rate, a terminal growth rate and an
Adjusted EBITDA multiple.

Goodwill arising from a new business combination is, for the purposes of impairment testing, allocated to those cash-generating
units that are expected to benefit from the goodwill that was acquired. Impairment testing is performed at the level of the
smallest groups of cash-generating units at which goodwill is monitored, known as the divisions.

Forecast cash flows used in the value in use calculation were determined by considering historic business performance, by
overlaying it with assumptions to reflect areas where growth or income improvement was expected, and by taking into account
the expected results of cost management programmes to which the Group was committed. These forecasts were extrapolated
to subsequent years using a steady growth rate being the CPI inflation rate of 3.8%, and a terminal value was calculated using the
perpetual growth model. The discount rate of 9.16% to 10.79% that was applied to the forecasts was a market participant
weighted average cost of capital calculated by reference to the Capital Asset Pricing Model.

The fair value of the Group was calculated based on multiples of forecast 2022 Adjusted EBITDA and on information provided by
external advisors, where that information is based on recent transactions in the insurance broking industry. The fair value of a
division was estimated by apportioning the fair value of the Group between the divisions based on the value in use of each
division. The estimated costs of disposal are assumed, based on market experience, to be 1.5% of the fair value of the division.

See note 11 for the carrying values of goodwill and intangible assets at the period end.

**5** **Segmental analysis**

Descriptions of the Group’s operating segments can be found in Section 1.

Under IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’, the Group determines and presents operating segments based on the information that is
provided to the Group Executive Committee, which is the Group’s chief operating decision maker.

Segments are reviewed and revised as necessary following structural changes within the Group or acquisitions of new companies.

The Group Executive Committee assesses the performance of the operating segments based on an Adjusted EBITDA measure.
The presentation of the segment information reflects that. The Group Executive Committee assesses the financial position of the
Group on a consolidated Group basis and therefore does not regularly receive measures of total assets or total liabilities on an
operating segment basis. Accordingly, no financial position measures are reported within the Group’s segmental analysis.

The results include items directly attributable to an operating segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable
basis.

Commission and fees represent the Group’s revenue from contracts with customers, which is recognised in accordance with IFRS
15. The Group’s operating segments reflect its disaggregation of revenue.

Future tax impacts
In the March 2021 Budget, it was announced that the UK Corporation Tax Rate will rise from its current rate of 19% to 25%
with effect from April 2023. UK deferred tax balances as at 31 December 2022 are measured at the rate on the dates that the
respective assets and liabilities will reverse.

A number of countries (including the UK) have published draft legislation to implement the OECD "Pillar 2" reforms of the
international tax system and introduce a global minimum rate of corporate income tax of 15% with effect from 1 January
2024 or have indicated they are considering how to adapt their tax legislation in the light of these reforms.  Whilst the
potential impact cannot yet be reliably estimated in the absence of clear understanding of how the rules will be implemented
in all the jurisdictions in which we operate, it is not expected that the impact will be material.

‘Interdivision reclassifications’ arise from the reclassification of goodwill (and profits) across divisions. ‘Foreign exchange’
arises from the retranslation, using the exchange rate at the reporting date, of goodwill that resulted from the acquisition of
a foreign operation.

Goodwill is tested for impairment annually, and whenever there is an indication that it may be impaired. The annual
impairment test is performed as at 1 October each year. An impairment, if any, that results from that annual impairment
test would be reflected in the 31 December financial statements.

Goodwill is, for the purposes of impairment testing, allocated to CGUs or groups of CGUs expected to benefit from the
business combination associated with that goodwill, where a CGU is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generate
independent cash inflows. Management reviewed business performance, as at 1 October 2022, based on the CGUs or groups
of CGUs that are divisions. The divisions represented the lowest level within the Group at which goodwill was monitored for
internal management purposes, so the annual impairment test was performed by reference to the divisions.


-----

###### FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**11** **Intangible assets (continued)**

An impairment test of goodwill is performed by comparing the carrying amount of each division (i.e. CGU or group of CGUs),
including the goodwill, with the recoverable amount of the division. The recoverable amount of a division is the higher of its
fair value less costs of disposal (FVLCD) and its value in use (VIU), where the VIU of the division is the present value of its
future cash flows. If the recoverable amount of a division is lower than its carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised.

The impairment test of the divisions as at 1 October 2022 resulted in an impairment charge of £41m to goodwill in MGA
division. The impairment loss of £41m in MGA division is driven by a decrease in forecasted cashflows of the business as
compared to previous assessment and increase in the discount rate due to the prevailing economic environment. The
impairment charge is recorded within depreciation, amortisation and impairment of non-financial assets line in the
statement of profit or loss. Following the impairment test but during the year, MGA business was reorganised and transferred
to Retail, Advisory and Capital Solutions based on synergies with the respective divisions. The key data is summarised in the
following tables:

###### FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**11** **Intangible assets (continued)**

Further information is provided below about the amounts in the above tables:

- _Goodwill:_
The ‘Interdivision reclassifications’ column in table 1 reflects the impact on goodwill of the reclassification of certain
businesses between divisions during the period presented. There were no interdivision reclassifications during the
period from 1 October 2021 to 1 October 2022.

The ‘Foreign exchange’ column in table 1 reflects the retranslation, using the exchange rate at the reporting date, of
goodwill that resulted from the acquisition of a foreign operation.

The ‘Acquisitions and disposals’ column in table 1 reflects the impact on goodwill of the acquisitions by the Group during
the period to 1 October 2022 of:
    - The share capital of Hooper Dolan companies, the goodwill of which is included in the Europe division;
    - The share capital of Ed Broking and Besso companies, the goodwill of which is included in the Specialty division;
    - The share capital of Lorega Holdings Limited, the goodwill of which is included in the Advisory division;
    - The share capital of Stuart Insurances Limited, the goodwill of which is included in the Europe division;
    - The business and assets of Oneglobal Broking Limited, the goodwill of which is included in the Specialty division;
    - The goodwill of various other individually not material businesses.

- _Carrying amount:_
The ‘Carrying amount’ column in table 3 includes the carrying amounts of the divisions. These amounts are determined
by adding back external debt and lease liabilities to the net assets of each division and the Corporate non-operating
segment, by allocating the resulting adjusted net assets of the Corporate non-operating segment across the divisions
pro rata to the resulting adjusted net assets of each division, and by adding these amounts to the goodwill of the
divisions after first grossing that goodwill up for the non-controlling interest.

- _Value in use:_
The ‘VIU’ column in table 2 includes the present value of future cash flows of the divisions together with an allocation
of the cash flows of the Corporate non-operating segment, where the cash flows are based on the most recent five-year
forecast for Adjusted EBITDA as approved by management, pro forma for completed transactions as at 1 October 2022.
These forecasts were determined by considering historic business performance, by overlaying it with assumptions to
reflect areas where growth or income improvement is expected, and by taking into account the expected results of cost
management programmes to which the Group is committed. The 2027 forecast is extrapolated to subsequent years
using a steady growth rate being the forecast CPI inflation rate of 3.8% per annum, and a terminal value is calculated
using the perpetual growth model. The discount rates that have been applied to the forecasts, in particular 10.33% for
Advisory, 10.33% for Retail, 10.26% for Specialty, 10.15% for MGA, 9.39% for Europe, and 10.85% for Global Partners,
are market participant weighted average cost of capitals calculated by reference to the Capital Asset Pricing Model.

- _Fair value less costs of disposal:_
The ‘FVLCD’ column in table 2 is determined by reference to the fair value of the Group, which is calculated based on
multiples of forecast 2023 Adjusted EBITDA and on information provided by external advisors. The estimated costs of
disposal, which are assumed based on market experience to be 1.5% of the fair value of the division, are then deducted
to determine the FVLCD of the division.

- _Recoverable amount:_
The ‘Recoverable amount’ column in tables 2 and 3 is equal to the VIU for all divisions, as VIU is greater than FVLCD in
all cases.

-----

The key assumption to which the VIU and thus the recoverable amount is most sensitive is the five-year forecast for Adjusted
EBITDA. If the five-year forecast for Adjusted EBITDA were to be further decreased by 10%, impairment to the MGA division
will be increased to £57m. If the five-year forecast for Adjusted EBITDA were to be decreased by 65.85%, there would also
be an impairment to the Global Partners division. If the five-year forecast for Adjusted EBITDA were to be decreased by
66,41%, there would also be an impairment to the Europe division. If the five-year forecast for Adjusted EBITDA were to be
decreased by 67.04%, there would also be an impairment to the Advisory division. No further reasonably possible change in
this assumption alone would result in an impairment to any other CGU.

**13** **Leases**

The majority of the Group’s leases are for properties in the UK and these leases typically run for a period of 5-10 years. Some of
the Group’s leases are being held over beyond the original end date of the lease. Rent is normally fixed but may be subject to a
review every few years. Many of the Group’s long-term contracts have an option to terminate the lease prior to its end date, but
in most cases termination options are not reasonably certain to be exercised so that the lease liability reflects all lease payments
through to the ultimate end date of the lease. Service charges and other contractual payments to the lessor are excluded from
the measurement of the lease liability. VAT (including when it is irrecoverable) and business rates are also excluded from the
measurement of the lease liability as they do not constitute a lease payment under IFRS 16.

The Group does not act as a lessor other than as a sublessor. Subleases are not considered material for the Group.

Leases of low value assets, for which the Group applies the practical expedient not to recognise a lease liability, are not
considered material for the Group.

The table below provides a schedule of the movements in the carrying amount of the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities
(when the Group acts as a lessee) that are held on the statement of financial position during the year ended 31 December 2022.

###### FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**14** **Business combinations (continued)**

The above table reflects the impact of measurement period adjustments made in 2022, relating to acquisitions completed in
2021. The significant measurement period adjustments are listed below:

- Acquisition of Ed Broking Group Limited and Besso Insurance Group Limited (the ‘Ed Broking and Besso companies’)
– A measurement period adjustment was recorded to adjust the estimated net asset recoverable figure, to correct an
investment value, add a provision for an E&O liability and an accrual for bonuses payable along with other re-allocations.
Following these adjustments and the receipt of the external purchase price allocation report (‘PPA report’) the identifiable
intangible assets were re-classified and as a result customer relationships reduced by £(47.9)m, brand reduced by £(3.2)m,
Intellectual property increased by £5.6m and the deferred tax liability reduced by £12.1m. As a result, Goodwill increased by
£62.0m.

- Acquisition of AccuRisk Solutions LLC – A measurement period adjustment was recorded to allocate the identifiable
intangible assets recognised on acquisition. Customer relationships decreased by £(3.4)m, brand increased by £0.8m and the
deferred tax liability decreased by £2.4m. As a result, Goodwill increased by £0.2m.

- Acquisition of Usay Group Limited – A measurement period adjustment was recorded to allocate the identifiable
intangibles recognised on acquisition. Customer relationships decreased by £(6.0)m, brand increased by £4.3m, intellectual
property increased by £2.4m and the deferred tax liability decreased by £1.0m. As a result, Goodwill decreased by £(0.6)m.

- Acquisition of the Hooper Dolan companies – A measurement period adjustment was recorded to allocate the
identifiable intangibles recognised on acquisition. Customer relationships increased by £8.3m, brand increased by £0.2m and
the deferred tax liability increased by £(1.1)m. As a result, Goodwill decreased by £(7.3)m.

The acquisitions were accounted for under IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’, which requires that the identifiable assets
acquired and the liabilities assumed, including certain contingent liabilities, are measured at their acquisition date fair value.
Goodwill is calculated as the difference between the acquisition consideration and the acquisition date fair value of the net
assets/(liabilities) acquired. Goodwill represents expected synergies from combining operations of the acquiree and the
Group, and/or intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition, and is allocated to the acquirer’s cash generating
units, or groups of cash-generating units, that are expected to benefit from the synergies from combing operations of the
acquiree and the Group.

The amounts recognised in the year end consolidated financial statements are all provisional for 2022 acquisitions and
adjustments may occur during the remainder of the measurement period, which is twelve months from the date of
acquisition.

The revenue and loss of the combined entity for the current reporting period as though the acquisition date for all business
combinations that occurred during the year had been as of the beginning of the annual reporting period is disclosed in Section
3.

Contract assets are amounts of revenue recognised by the Group that are subject to variability.

Contract liabilities represent the Group’s obligation to transfer services to customers for which the Group has received the
consideration (or the amount is due) from the customer.

The Group applies the practical expedient in IFRS 15 not to disclose information about the transaction price associated with
performance obligations to be completed after the reporting date, if the performance obligation is part of a contract that has an
original expected duration of one year or less. With respect to contracts with an original expected duration of more than a year,
the aggregate amount of transaction price allocated to performance obligations that are unsatisfied (or partially satisfied) as of the
reporting date is £14.4m. This amount is expected to be recognised as revenue as follows:


**31 December** 31 December

The Group’s cost to fulfil balance at each reporting period reflects salaries and other costs of customer-facing employees who
undertake activities necessary to satisfy anticipated contracts with the customer. This is subsequently released to the profit or loss
when the Group recognises the related revenue from those contracts, which is usually after the reporting date (1-3 months). The
net impact on profit or loss for the year ending 31 December 2022 in staff costs was £0.4 (2021: £0.4m).

Costs to obtain include incremental fees paid to aggregator websites for obtaining new business and are amortised, on a systematic
basis that is consistent with the transfer to the customer of the goods or services to which the asset relates, over the average life
of the relationship with the customer.

Amortisation amounting to £28.5m (2021: £18.1m) was recognised in the profit or loss during the period ending 31 December
2022.

###### FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**23** **Financial instruments (continued)**

**Fair value measurement**
Financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value in the statement of financial position are grouped into three levels of
a fair value hierarchy. The three levels are defined based on the observability of significant inputs to the measurement, as follows:

  - Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;

  - Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly
as prices, or indirectly derived from prices; and

  - Level 3: unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.

The following table shows the levels within the hierarchy of financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on an ongoing
basis:

**Level 1** **Level 2** **Level 3** **Total**

###### FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**23** **Financial instruments (continued)**

**Fair value measurement (continued)**

The following valuation techniques are used for instruments categorised in Levels 2 and 3:

**Derivative financial instruments (Level 2)**
The Group’s derivatives are categorised within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. These contracts are not traded in an active market,
but the fair value is determined using valuation techniques and available market data, such as forward exchange rates
corresponding to the maturity of the contract observable at the statement of financial position date and an appropriate sector
credit spread.

**Trade and other receivables/contingent consideration receivable (Level 3)**

Trade and other receivables at 31 December 2022 includes assets at fair value through profit or loss that were recognised on a
business combination in relation to the Group’s right to variable consideration on rolling contracts with customers for which the
performance obligation was satisfied prior to the acquisition. The fair value is a level 3 valuation and is calculated as the present
value of future cash flows where those cash flows take into account expected cancellation rates and the life of the underlying
insurance product.

**Contingent consideration, share buyout and deferred proceeds (Level 3)**

The contingent consideration, deferred consideration and share buyout liability were acquired on the acquisition of, Lorega
Holdings Limited, Leobros B.V. Frank Glennon Limited, and other acquisitions that are individually not material.

Share buyout is the liability arising from put options granted to minority shareholders of certain consolidated subsidiaries, giving
the holders the right to sell all of their interest in those subsidiaries to the Group. The fair value of the share buyout payments is
determined based on the discounted present value of the forecast option strike price, where the discount rate is the Group WACC
if the strike price is a multiple of forecast EBITDA less net debt.

Contingent consideration payments are generally contingent on the post-acquisition performance of the acquired business and
achievement of certain performance thresholds. The fair value of contingent consideration is determined based on actual and
forecast business performance of the acquired business, discounted using the Group WACC as the discount rate.

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**23** **Financial instruments (continued)**

**Unlisted investments at fair value through other comprehensive income (Level 3)**
Unlisted investments are categorised within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The valuation technique applied, except where
specific market price information is available, is cost less any provision for impairment.

**Fair value of financial instruments measured at amortised cost**
The Directors consider the carrying amounts for trade and other receivables, trade and other payables, and the current portion of
financial liabilities that are not measured at fair value, to approximate their fair values. The fair value of the Group’s borrowings is
disclosed in note 27.

**Reconciliation of recurring fair value measurements within level 3**
The table below provides a schedule of movements in the carrying amount in the statement of financial position of financial assets

###### FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**23** **Financial instruments (continued)**

**Financial instruments risk**

The Group is exposed to various risks in relation to financial instruments. The main types of risks are market risk, credit risk and
liquidity risk. As part of its overall governance and control arrangements, the Group operates a risk management framework (RMF)
designed to identify, assess, manage, monitor and report on these risks.

The Group does not actively engage in the trading of financial assets for speculative purposes. The most significant financial risks
to which the Group is exposed are described below.

**Market risk analysis**

The Group is exposed to market risk through its use of financial instruments and specifically to foreign currency risk and interest
rate risk.

**Foreign currency risk**

The Group’s main exposure to foreign currency risk arises from: (i) its USD borrowings, and (ii) the settlement in foreign currency,
principally USD, of brokerage and fees relating to the placement of insurance business originating overseas. The Group uses
derivatives, specifically forward contracts to mitigate its foreign currency risk.

The Group has forward contracts that mitigate its exposure to foreign currency risk on certain USD revenue arising on the
placement of premiums denominated in USD, which is not the presentation nor functional currency of the Group. Based on forecast
transactions, the Group effectively sells USD revenue by reference to individual brokerage transactions. The hedged USD revenues
currently exclude the USD revenues resulting from the acquisition on 1 November 2021 of Ed Broking Group Limited. These
revenues are designated as hedged items against the USD PIK toggle note.

For further information on hedge accounting please refer to note 24.

**Interest rate risk**

The Group has USD 500.0m of PIK toggle notes, but that is at fixed interest rates and thus does not give rise to interest rate risk.
The Group’s main exposure to interest rate risk arises from its £1,592.8m floating rate senior secured term loan, which has exposure
to EURIBOR, SOFRA and SONIA (previously GBP LIBOR) benchmark interest rates. The Group uses derivatives, specifically interest
rate swaps, to mitigate this interest rate risk.

The Group is also exposed to USD LIBOR on the USD 540.0m CAR facility and has entered into derivatives to mitigate this interest
rate exposure.

The Group is also exposed to changes in interest rates through its secured revolving credit facility borrowings at variable interest
rates. However, these borrowings were undrawn as at 31 December 2022.


-----

###### FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**23** **Financial instruments (continued)**

**Credit risk analysis**

Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty fails to discharge an obligation to the Group. The Group is exposed to this risk as it has a
significant amount of trade receivables due from policyholders and from insurance companies with which it places insurance.
However, most of the credit risk with policyholders is mitigated by the Group’s ability to cancel the underlying policies and recoup
a portion of the amount from insurers.

The Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk is limited to the carrying amount of financial assets recognised at 31 December, as
summarised below:

**31 December** 31 December
**2022** 2021
**£000** £000

Cash and cash equivalents **1,227,310** 1,335,315
Trade and other receivables excluding prepayments **879,964** 751,161
Contract assets **21,107** 18,523
Convertible loan receivable **-** 63,833
Other financial assets at fair value through profit or loss **5,149** 27,387

**2,133,530** 2,196,219

Counterparty balances are monitored as part of the credit control process. Significant balances are actively managed through the
Group’s ongoing strategic insurer relationship programme.

The Group had certain trade receivables as at 31 December 2022 that had not been settled by the contractual due date but that
were not considered to be impaired.

The credit risk for cash and cash equivalents, money market funds and derivative financial instruments is considered negligible as
the counterparties are reputable financial institutions with high quality external credit ratings. The Group does not hold any
collateral as security.


-----

###### FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**23** **Financial instruments (continued)**

**Expected credit losses**

The estimated ECL for the current period is calculated based on actual credit loss experience over two years by segment. Actual
credit loss experience is, where appropriate, adjusted by scalar factors to reflect differences between economic conditions during
the period over which the historical data was collected, current conditions and the Group’s view of economic conditions over the
expected lives of the receivables. The scalar factors are based on GDP and unemployment rate forecasts (source: HM Treasury
‘Forecasts for the UK Economy’) and include the following:

    - GDP: A 119.02% decrease in the growth in GDP is expected, from 4.08% in 2022 to (0.78%) in 2023 which indicates that
historical credit loss experience should be increased.

    - Unemployment rate: A 14.57% increase in unemployment rates is expected, from 3.78% in 2022 to 4.33% in 2023,
which indicates that historical credit loss experience should be increased.

ECL is measured on the basis that the counterparties are a single group and the calculation is not further distinguished between
the Group’s different customer types.

The following table shows the movement in lifetime ECL that has been recognised for trade receivables in accordance with the
simplified approach set out in IFRS 9:

###### FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**23** **Financial instruments (continued)**

**Liquidity risk analysis**

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group might be unable to meet its obligations.

The Group manages its liquidity needs by monitoring scheduled debt servicing payments for long-term financial liabilities as well as forecasting cash inflows and outflows due in day-to-day
business. The Group is cash generative and has an active cash management process. The Group Treasury function undertakes short term cash flow forecasting and closely monitors and manages
the Group’s cash balances. Immediate liquidity is available from the revolving credit facility (RCF) should any short-term financing be required. Drawings permissible under the RCF are limited
by the Group’s credit facility arrangements. The RCF facility was undrawn as at 31 December 2022.

The following are the remaining undiscounted contractual maturities (excluding interest payments) of non-derivative financial liabilities at the reporting date, except for lease liabilities (note
13). Information about derivative financial liabilities is given in note 24.

**24** **Hedge accounting**

See the principal risks and uncertainties section in the Strategic Report with respect to the Group’s exposure to foreign currency
risk and interest rate risk, and how the Group mitigates those risks. Further details are provided below.

**Derivatives and other financial instruments designated as hedging instruments**

The Group has economic hedge relationships that mitigate foreign exchange risk arising from its USD revenue and interest rate risk
on USD Libor borrowings, which have been designated in a hedge accounting relationship. The Group applies hedge accounting for
those hedge relationships that meet the hedge accounting criteria detailed in note 3. The Group manages all other risks associated
with these exposures, such as credit risk, but it does not apply hedge accounting for those risks.

The Group has the following derivative financial instruments in designated hedging relationships, as at the end of the year:

The following table contains the notional amounts of items designated as hedging instruments:

PIK toggle notes (USD 620.7m) **513,085**

**1,071,386**

**Derivatives hedging borrowings**

The Group had interest rate swaps to hedge the floating rate exposures on its privately placed term facility due 2026 comprising
£1,412.8m denominated in GBP paying SONIA and €180.0m denominated in Euros paying EURIBOR. These interest rate swaps
matured in July 2022.

The Group entered into interest rate swaps of USD 200.0m, USD 200.0m and USD 140.0m on 23 June 2022, 1 July 2022 and 26 July
2022 respectively, the purpose of which was to hedge the USD LIBOR rate exposure on its USD 540.0m CAR facility due 2026. The
23 June 2022 and 26 July 2022 swaps mature on 14 January 2027. The 1 July 2022 swap matures on 14 January 2026. All three
instruments exchange a floating interest rate with a fixed interest rate. Interest rate swaps referencing USD LIBOR will transition
during 2023 to replacement rates using the standard International Swaps and Derivatives Association transition process.

**Derivatives hedging forecast revenue**

The Group enters into forward contracts to mitigate the exposure resulting from USD revenue arising on the placement of certain
premiums denominated in USD, which is not the presentation currency nor functional currency of the Group.

Based on forecast transactions, the Group effectively sells accumulated USD revenue by reference to individual brokerage
transactions. The Group’s track record in receiving USD revenue from long established clients provides a high degree of confidence
that forecast transactions are highly probable for hedge accounting purposes.

On 1 October 2022, the Group designated its PIK toggle notes in a hedging relationship with this forecast USD revenue.

**24** **Hedge accounting (continued)**

The Group does not currently use derivative contracts to hedge the currency risk on its €180.0m privately placed term facility or
its USD 540.0m CAR facility, but there is a natural currency hedge with the Euro investments and with the USD investment in Ed
Broking Group Limited. The translation differences arising on the foreign denominated borrowings are recognised within finance
costs in the income statement, whereas the translation differences arising on the foreign operations are recognised in other
comprehensive income, in the foreign currency translation reserve in equity.

###### FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**26** **Employee benefits**

**Long-term incentive plans**
The Group has a number of long-term incentive schemes. The amounts that will ultimately vest are dependent on achievement
against various performance measures (including Group EBITDA and individual contribution targets) and/or service conditions.
The incentives are paid to participants at the end of the relevant performance and/or service period.

**Defined contribution pension schemes**
Contributions by the Company into defined contribution schemes during the period were £24.6m.

**Defined benefit pension schemes**
The Group operates two unfunded defined benefit schemes in Germany (the 'German schemes') and one funded defined benefit
scheme in the UK, the Cooper Gay (Holdings) Limited Retirement Benefits Scheme (the ‘UK scheme’). The projected unit credit
actuarial cost method has been used in determining the present value of the defined benefit obligation, the current service cost
and, where applicable, past service cost.

Responsibility for governance of the UK plan, including investment decisions and contribution schedules, lies with trustees, who
are required to consult Ed Broking Holdings (London) Limited, which is the only employer company that participates in the UK
Scheme.

The Group cash contributions to the pension schemes are determined by reference to actuarial valuations undertaken by the
schemes' actuaries at intervals not exceeding three years, and not by the provisions of IAS 19. These funding valuations can differ
materially from the requirements of IAS 19. In particular the discount rate used to determine the value of liabilities under IAS 19
is determined by reference to the yield on high grade corporate bonds of comparable duration to the liabilities. In contrast, the
discount rate used in the funding valuation is determined by reference to the yield on the schemes' current and projected future
investment portfolio. The UK scheme operates under the terms of funding proposals that are reviewed by the relevant pension
authority.

Full actuarial valuations were carried out as at December 2021 for the German Schemes and as at 31 December 2018 for the UK
Scheme, with an updated valuation at 31 December 2021 completed. In general, actuarial valuations are not available for public
inspection, but the results of valuations are advised to the members of the scheme.

**Description of Funding Arrangements and Funding Policy That Affect Future Contributions**

All schemes are closed to new entrants.

The German Schemes are unfunded and as such no funding arrangements apply. One German scheme is closed whilst the other
is open to future accrual.

The UK defined benefit scheme is open to future accrual. Where a funding valuation reveals a deficit in a scheme, the Group will
generally agree a schedule of contributions with the Trustees designed to address the deficit over an agreed future time horizon.
The triennial actuarial valuation of the UK Scheme was last carried out as at 31 December 2021, and a recovery plan of £1.92m
per annum was agreed with the previous owners of the company, which runs to 31 July 2026. Pursuant to the sale and purchase
agreement between the Group and the sellers, the sellers will continue to contribute towards this actuarial deficit until July 2025,
or when the scheme is no longer in actuarial deficit. The Group has recognised a contingent consideration receivable on the
balance sheet for the payments due from the seller. Expected employer contributions for the next financial year are £2.1m.

###### FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**26** **Employee benefits (continued)**

**Employee benefit plan risks**
The employee benefit plans expose the Group to a number of risks, the most significant of which are:

**Asset volatility: The plan liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set by reference to corporate bond yields. If assets**
underperform this yield this will create a deficit. The plans hold equities and other growth assets which, though expected to
outperform corporate bonds in the long term, create volatility and risk in the short term. The allocation to growth assets is
monitored to ensure that it remains appropriate given the plans' long-term objectives.

**Discount rates: The discount rates employed in determining the present value of the schemes' liabilities are determined by**
reference to market yields at the balance sheet date on high-quality corporate bonds of a currency and term consistent with the
currency and term of the associated post-employment benefit obligations. Changes in discount rates impact the quantum of the
liabilities.

**Inflation risk: Some of the Group pension obligations have an inflation linkage; higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities**
(although in most cases, caps on the level of inflationary increases are in place to protect the plan against extreme inflation). The
rate of inflation is derived from the retail price index in the UK. The breakeven rate in the Eurozone is used for the basis for the
German inflation assumption.

**Longevity risk: In the majority of cases, the Group defined benefit schemes provide benefits for the life of the member, so**
increases in life expectancy will therefore give rise to higher liabilities.

The size of the obligation is sensitive to judgemental actuarial assumptions. These include demographic assumptions covering
mortality, economic assumptions covering price inflation and benefit increases, together with the discount rate. The expected
return on plan assets is also a key judgement.

The principal actuarial assumptions are as follows:


German
Schemes **UK Schemes** UK Schemes

31 December **31 December** 31 December

2021 **2022** 2021


**Key assumptions used**


**German**

Inflation rate (RPI) **n/a** n/a **3.10%** 3.35%
Inflation rate (CPI) **2.50%** 1.75% **2.70%** 2.90%

Assumptions regarding future mortality experience are set based on information from published statistics and experience in all
geographic regions, and they are selected to reflect the characteristics and experience of the membership of the relevant plans.
In relation to the UK, this has been done by adjusting standard mortality tables to reflect recent research into mortality
experience in the respective regions combined with an allowance for improvement factors. The average life expectancy, in years,
of a pensioner retiring at 65 is as follows:

The aggregation of the pension surplus on the UK scheme and the pension obligation on the German schemes, before related
deferred tax, changed to £(8.3)m at 31 December 2022 from £(4.7)m on acquisition.

The fair value of total plan assets relating to the Group's defined benefit pensions schemes decreased to £39.2m (2021: £65.2m)
at 31 December 2022.

The UK defined benefit pension scheme plan is open to future accrual but closed to new entrants.

The salaries upon which UK members earn pension benefits was frozen following a benefit change on 1 January 2007 and has
not increased since then (and will not increase in future).

The above sensitivity analyses are based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant. The sensitivity
analysis intends to provide assistance in understanding the sensitivity of the valuation of pension liabilities to market movements in
discount rates, inflation rates and mortality assumptions for scheme beneficiaries.

The UK trustees invest the funds in a range of assets with the objective of maximising the fund return with a view to containing the
cost of funding the scheme whilst at the same time maintaining an acceptable risk profile. In assessing the risk profile, the Trustees
take account of the nature and duration of the liabilities. Approximately 37% of the UK funds are invested in liability matching
investments with the UK Scheme having hedged broadly 77% of its interest and inflation risk (when measured on a gilts basis). The
trustees review investment strategy regularly.

The major categories and fair values of the UK scheme’s assets as at 31 December 2022 for each category are as follows:

###### FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

**NOTES TO E CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**28** **Current tax and deferred tax (continued)**

Deferred tax assets are recognised in the subsidiaries of Midco2 to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be
available against which the deductible temporary differences can be recovered.

In assessing the probability of recovery of the deferred tax assets, a review is undertaken of the 5 year forecasts and other
assumptions relating to future profitability. Where applicable, these deferred tax assets are limited to the level of the consolidated
deferred tax liability, as an estimate of the reasonableness of future profitability within the Ardonagh Group. This deferred tax
liability has been taken at the level of Ardonagh Group Holdings Limited as this is the level at which the group is managed at and
provides the basis for the measurement of deferred tax for group subsidiary companies.

The total gross deferred tax liability at the AGHL level is £337m, with a total deferred tax asset of £152m resulting in a net deferred
tax liability of £185m. The total gross deferred tax liability at Midco2 is £166m, with a total deferred tax asset of £148m resulting
in a net deferred tax liability of £18m. . Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are only offset if there is a legally enforceable
right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities, and if they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation
authority on the same taxable entity or on different taxable entities which intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a
net basis or to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.

As a result of offsetting the net deferred tax liability of £18m comprises a deferred tax asset of £34m relating to UK and a deferred
tax liability of £52m relating to non UK jurisdictions.

In the March 2021 Budget, it was announced that the UK Corporation Tax Rate will rise from its current rate of 19% to 25% with
effect from April 2023. UK deferred tax balances as at 31 December 2022 are measured at the rate that the respective assets and
liabilities will reverse.

The Group did not recognise deferred income tax assets in respect of deductible temporary differences as follows:

(As restated)*

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**29** **Provisions (continued)**

**General provision for litigation matters (including E&O claims)**
In the normal course of business, the Group may receive claims in respect of alleged errors and omissions and other matters.
Provisions are made in respect of such litigation matters, representing the best estimate of the liability based on legal advice where
appropriate. The outcome of the currently pending and future proceedings, in relation to errors and omissions and other matters,
cannot be predicted with certainty. Thus, an adverse decision in a current or future lawsuit could result in additional costs that are
not covered, either wholly or partially, under insurance policies and that are in excess of the presently established provisions.

**Property provision**
_Onerous lease £1.2m (2021: £1.7m)_
This provision provides for costs incurred on vacant properties, excluding rent costs (which are subject to lease accounting).

_Dilapidations £7.8m (2021: £10.8m)_
This provision provides for the estimated amounts payable for dilapidations on each property at the end of the lease term.

**Future renewal scheme**
The provision for the future renewal scheme for the Towergate Health business represents the estimated costs to be paid to
appointed representatives that meet certain eligibility criteria under a contract termination scheme introduced by the acquiree
and is based on the amount that would be receivable by each appointed representative in respect of their portfolio if they remain
active as an appointed representative.

Amounts are paid to appointed representatives over a period of four years from when the eligibility criteria under the scheme are
met and they cease to act as an appointed representative. The amount paid is dependent on factors such as the size of the portfolio
of the appointed representative and the rate of renewal commission on the underlying policies.

When the retirement of an appointed representative is agreed, the related liability is transferred to other creditors (within trade
and other payables).

**Other provision**
The other provision balance at 31 December 2022 includes a £0.7m restructuring provisions for onerous contracts.

**31** **Share-based payments**

**Equity-settled share-based payment schemes:**

The Group operates the Ardonagh MIP III schemes, comprising the Tier 1 arrangements and the Enterprise Growth Plan (EGP)
scheme, which were implemented and issued in 2022 and early 2023, both of which are equity-settled share-based payment
schemes with the corresponding shares being the MIP III A and MIP III B shares respectively, issued by Ardonagh Holdco Limited
which is the parent company of Ardonagh New Midco 1 Limited, which is a parent of the Company. In addition, Tara Topco Limited
(the parent of Ardonagh Holdco Limited and the ultimate parent of the Company) grants B Ordinary shares to the Group’s
employees and key management at fair value. These shares have no dividend or voting rights and vest on the occurrence of a
crystallisation event, being the earlier of a liquidity event, an IPO and a winding up.

The fair value of the services received in exchange for the grant of the shares is recognised as an expense, measured based on the
grant date fair value of the shares and recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. In the arrangements listed above,
shares were granted in exchange for fair value consideration and therefore no expense was recognised in the current year in
relation to these.

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**31** **Share-based payments (continued)**

The grant date fair value of the Ardonagh MIP III scheme is calculated using a Probability Weighted Expected Returns model
(PWERM), which takes a market approach on a forward-looking basis before applying a net present value adjusted. The valuation
also includes discounts for the opportunity cost of equity and lack of control. The weighted-average fair value of shares granted
during the period and the significant inputs used in the measurement of fair value were as follows:

**Tara** **TAGL**

**Significant inputs:**
**Equity value of issuing entity (£m)** **2,985** n/a **n/a** 2,673 **n/a** 2,673

The total expense recognised for share-based payments is £4.5m, comprising £2.9m in relation to equity-settled share-based
payment schemes and £1.6m in relation to cash-settled share-based payment schemes.

**Cash-settled share-based payment schemes:**

The Group operates cash-settled share-based payment schemes under which employees hold shares in some of the Group’s
subsidiaries that entitle them to put those shares back to the Group for a cash amount that is based on the value of the shares.
The shares track the value of certain businesses in the Group within the Ardonagh Specialty operating segment. The fair value of
the liability is estimated based on multiples of forecast Adjusted EBITDA of the businesses whose values the shares track.

The number of shares held by employees under these schemes are as follows:

**Number of shares**

Start of the year **117,000**

Granted during the year **334,114**

Brought back during the year **(31,000)**

Outstanding at 31 December 2022 **420,114**

The Group recognises a liability for its obligation to settle these share-based payments in cash, where that liability is measured at
the reporting date as the accrued portion of the fair value by reference to the vesting period. The Group recognised an employee
expense of £41.6m in the period ended 31 December 2022 and the liability as at 31 December 2022 was £0.1m.

###### INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF ARDONAGH MIDCO 2 PLC

 Report on the audit of the financial statements

1. Opinion

In our opinion:

- the financial statements of Ardonagh Midco 2 Pie (the 'parent company') and its subsidiaries (the 'group') give a true and
fair view of the state of the group's and of the parent company's affairs as at 31 December 2021 and of the group's loss
for the year then ended;

- the group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom adopted international
accounting standards;

- the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally
Accepted Accounting Practice, including Financial Reporting Standard 101 "Reduced Disclosure Framework"; and

and United Kingdom adopted international accounting standards. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in
the preparation of the parent company financial statements is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards,
including FRS 101 "Reduced Disclosure Framework" (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).

2. Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our
responsibilities under those standards are further described in the auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial
statements section of our report.

We are independent of the group and the parent company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our
audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the Financial Reporting Council's (the 'FRC's') Ethical Standard as applied
to listed entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

3. Summary of our audit approach

**Materiality**

**Scoping**

**Significant changes in our**
**approach**


Within this report, key audit matters are identified as follows:
###### Q) Newly identified

 @ Increased level of risk
 @ Similar level of risk @ Decreased level of risk

The materiality that we used for the group financial statements was £9m which was determined on
the basis of 0.98% of Commissions and Fees.

Scoping coverage included 9 components subject to full scope audits and a further 9 subject to the
audit of specified account balances. These scoped in entities represent 82% of group Revenue and
84% of group total cash.

There have been no significant changes to our audit approach compared to the prior year except for
changes in the key audit matters as described below.

In the current year, the Preference share issue: classification as debt or equity and Acquisition
accounting under IFRS 3 business combinations - Bravo, were both considered Key Audit Matters
given the significance of the preference share issue and the Bravo acquisition to the group. The
Enhanced Transfer Value ("ETV") provision is no longer considered a Key Audit Matter as the ETV
redress programme is nearing completion with the net ETV provision being considered not material.


4. Conclusions relating to going concern
In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting in the
preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.

Our evaluation of the directors' assessment of the group's and parent company's ability to continue to adopt the going concern
basis of accounting is discussed in section 5.1.

Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that,
individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the group's and parent company's ability to continue as a going
concern for a period of at least twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue.

Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections
of this report.

5. Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial
statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due
to fraud) that we identified. These matters included those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the
allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team.

These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion
thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

**5.1. Going Concern@**

Key audit matter Management makes an assessment of the group's ability to continue as a going concern, taking into
**description** account all available information about the future, which is at least, but is not limited to, twelve
months from the date when the financial statements are authorised for issue. The Directors'


-----

concluded that it is appropriate to prepare the financial statements for the 12 months ended 31
December 2021 on a going concern basis.

As at 31 December 2021 the group has debt (current and non-current) amounting to £2,67Sm (2020:
£1,969m). The borrowings include $500m payment-in-kind ("PIK") toggle notes due 2027, a privately
placed term loan facility due 2026 of £1,57Sm, a £300m committed Capex, Acquisition and Re­
organisation ("CAR") facility due 2026 and a $540m CAR facility due 2026.

Under the terms of the debt arrangements the group also continues to benefit from the availability
of a Revolving Credit Facility ("RCF").

The group's finance costs on bank and other borrowings give rise to annual interest costs of £217.4m
(?020: £136.4m), which are considered within year end forecast cash flows.

As part of their going concern assessment, the Directors have considered the principal risks facing
the group, including the potential continued financial and operational impacts of Covid-19, and its
systems of risk management and internal control. In the light of the economic uncertainty caused by
Covid-19 the Directors have considered key stress scenarios as follows:

                     - Shortfalls in base case projected income throughout 2022 and 2023;

                     - Deterioration in base case cash conversion rates over and above the shortfalls in income;
and

Mitigating actions within management control including delayed capital expenditure, a
reduction in discretionary spend and some reduction in employee headcount and remuneration.

Auditing the going concern assessment involved subjective judgement and an increased extent of
effort, including the rieed to make additional enquiries of management outside of the finance
function.

Refer to Note 2 to the financial statements for the basis of preparation.

**How the scope of our audit** We have gained an understanding of management's process for performing the going concern
**responded to the key audit** assessment and obtained an understanding of relevant controls.
**matter**

We performed the following audit procedures:

               - We evaluated and challenged key assumptions underpinning cash flow forecasts, the stresses
applied and the reverse stress test. In particular we compared market forecast assumptions for
2022 and 2023 with the actual performance in 2021 compared to the revised budgets
developed in March 2021.

               - We assessed mitigating cost actions within management's control and tested the availability of
the RCF and compliance with debt covenants;

               - We made inquiries of senior management in relation to their assessment of the continued
operational impacts of Covid -19 on the group including inquiries regarding business resilience;

               - We inspected correspondence between the group and its regulators

               - We performed an analysis of the group's financial performance in the first two months after the
balance sheet date; and

               - We assessed financial statement disclosures in respect of going concern for transparency and
inclusion of all facts and circumstances of which we are aware through the performance of the_
audit work.


Key observations


We concur with the Directors' conclusion that it is appropriate to prepare the financial statements
for the 12 months ended 31 December 2021 on a going concern basis.


-----

**5.2. Goodwill Impairment** @

**Key audit matter** Goodwill arising on business combinations is a significant asset on the balance sheet of the group
**description** £1,619.6m (2020: £1,192.0m). Goodwill increased significantly during 2021 following significant
acquisitions. As required by IAS 36 Impairment of Assets, goodwill is tested for impairment at least
annually. Management concluded no impairment was required.

During 2021 the group continued to monitor goodwill at the division level as this remained the
lowest level of aggregation of cash generating units within the group at which goodwill could be
monitored for management purposes. Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an
estimation of the recoverable amount of each division, using the higher of value in use ("VIU") and
fair value less costs to dispose ("FVLCD").

The VIU amount is subjective and calculated using an impairment model underpinned by key
assumptions including forecast cash flows, discount rates and long-term growth rates.

Management use a VIU approach to assess the recoverable amount of all divisions. A headroom
calculation is performed as the amount of calculated VIU above the carrying value of the division.
Divisions with less head room are at greater risk of impairment where the impairment model is
sensitive to key assumptions.

Refer to Note 4 to the financial statements (Key sources of estimation uncertainty) and Note 13 to
the financial statements (Intangible assets).

How the scope of our audit We have gained an understanding of management's process for performing the annual impairment
responded to the key audit test and obtained an understanding of relevant controls.
matter

In addition, we performed the following audit procedures:

               - We reviewed and challenged management's CGU assessment through assessing the level at
which cash inflows are generated and the level at which goodwill is monitored;

               - We challenged the assumptions used in the annual impairment review, in particular forecast
growth rates applied to each of the divisions within the five year business plan through
assessing segment strategies and planned business development;

               - We tested the accuracy of management's impairment model;

               - We performed an assessment of actual FY 2021 cash flows against prior period forecasts to
assess the accuracy of management's forecasting; and

               - We involved our valuation specialists to assess and challenge the discount rate used.


**Key audit matter** Goodwill arising on business combinations is a significant asset on the balance sheet of the group
**description** £1,619.6m (2020: £1,192.0m). Goodwill increased significantly during 2021 following significant
acquisitions. As required by IAS 36 Impairment of Assets, goodwill is tested for impairment at least
annually. Management concluded no impairment was required.


**Key observations**


We considered that management's conclusion that no impairment is required as of 31 December
2021 is reasonable.

The forecasts used in the annual impairment exercise were consistent with the most recent financial
forecasts approved by the Board.

Key assumptions including discount rates and growth rates used within business forecasts are
reasonable.

We considered the financial statements disclosures in relation to the goodwill impairment test were
appropriate and as required by IAS 36.


-----

**5.3. Acquisition accounting under IFRS 3 Business combinations - Bravo (D**

**Key audit matter** On 14 July 2020 the group acquired Nevada 4 Midco 1 Limited together with its subsidiary
**description** undertaking Bravo Investment Holdings Limited ("Bravo"). This transaction constituted a business
combination under IFRS 3 Business combinations.

Management engaged a third-party expert to perform an independent fair value assessment of the
acquired intangible assets at the valuation date and perform the Purchase Price Allocation ("PPA")
for financial reporting purposes. Management have 12 months from the date of acquisition to
finalise the acquisition accounting.

Transactions that constitute a business combination under IFRS 3 must be accounted for by applying
the acquisition method, so that the assets and liabilities assumed are recognised by the acquirer at
their acquisition-date fair values. Specifically, there are four steps in its application:

Identification of the acquirer;
Determination of the acquisition date;
Recognition and measurement of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed;

Recognition and measurement of goodwill.
The Bravo acquisition is considered a key audit matter due to the scale of the transaction and the
complexity of accounting due to the PPA approach.

Refer to Note 13 to the financial statements (Intangible assets).

How the scope of our audit We have gained an understanding of management's process for acquisition accounting and obtained
responded to the key audit an understanding of relevant controls.
**matter**

In addition, we performed the following audit procedures:

               - We evaluated the competence, capabilities and objectivity of management expert;

               - We assessed management's projections, forecasts and accounting assumptions including the
impact of Covid-19 on the underlying cash flow assumptions, used in the fair value analysis;

               - We tested the completeness and accruacy of data inputs used in the valuation of intangible
assets; and

               - We invloved our valuation specialists in assessing the reasonableness of the key valuation
assumptions (discount rate, long-term growth rate, valuation multiples) and whether the
valuation assumptions are consistent with what market participants would use in pricing the
item.


**Key audit matter** On 14 July 2020 the group acquired Nevada 4 Midco 1 Limited together with its subsidiary


**Key observations**


No issues were noted through our detailed testing of the Purchase Price Accounting exercise of the
Bravo acquisition.


**S.4 Presentation of Alternative Performance Measures (APMs)@**

**Key audit matter** Adjusted EBITDA is a key metric that management use to assess the quality of the group's earnings.
**description** Management removes adjusting items ("Items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA"), being significant
acquisition and disposal related items and other costs associated with the ongoing transformation of
the group. Pro formas are presented as if the significant acquisition and disposal related transactions
occurred on the first day of the comparative period.


-----

The group reports Items excluded from Reported Adjusted EBITDA of £98.2m (2020: £72.2m), and
Adjusted EBITDA pro forma for completed transactions of £105.7m (2020: £73.4m) in the Annual

               - Report.

This measure and other such non-GAAP measures used are Alternative Performance Measures
("APMs"). An APM is defined by European Securities and Markets Authority ("ESMA") as "a financial
measure of historical or future performance, financial position, or cash flows, other than a financial
measure defined or specified in the applicable financial reporting framework (e.g. UK adopted IFRS)
applied by the entity".

The group has in place adjusting items definitions (see Glossary in Section 3 of the Annual Report)
and a risk exists that these are not consistently applied across the group. In addition, there is a risk
that these adjusting items are not clearly disclosed and that undue prominence is given to APMs
compared to the statutory results of the group within the Annual Report.

Refer to section 1 of the Annual Report (Summary of group Financial Performance) and section 3 of
the Annual Report (Other unaudited financial information).

**How the scope of our audit** We have gained an understanding of management's process for APMs and obtained an
**responded to the key audit** understanding of relevant controls.
**matter**

We performed the following procedures:

Tested management's reporting of a sample of items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA to assess
consistency with the group's published definition and policies for these items;

Tested a sample of items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA to invoice or other supporting
evidence for the expense;

Assessed whether the use of APMs in the group's annual report is consistent with the guidelines
produced by regulators;

Assessed whether there is appropriate balance between the use of statutory metrics, Pro Forma
Adjusted EBITDA and other APMs, together with clear definitions and reconciliations within the
Annual Report;

Assessed the prominence given to Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and other APMs relative to the
group's statutory results; and

Considered whether Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and other APMs were consistently applied in
the current year annual report and as presented in the prior year annual report.


**Key observations**


Our testing of a sample of items presented as adjusting did not identify any instances that were not
presented in accordance with the group's definitions.

We considered that the group's use and presentation of Alternative Performance Measures was
acceptable and consistently applied.


**5.5 Revenue recognition - Estimation of Variable Consideration reported in Commissions and fees and revaluation of the**

**trail commission asset acquired with Swinton ("Swinton Monthly Products asset") reported in Other income** @

Key audit matter In accordance with ISA 240, during the year ended 31 December 2021 we identified a risk of fraud in
description revenue recognition, in relation to two sources of material revenue within Commissions and Fees
£915.4m (2020: £689.lm) and Other Income £24.9m (2020: £22.7m).


Key audit matter In accordance with ISA 240, during the year ended 31 December 2021 we identified a risk of fraud in
description revenue recognition, in relation to two sources of material revenue within Commissions and Fees
£915.4m (2020: £689.lm) and Other Income £24.9m (2020: £22.7m).


-----

**Estimation of variable consideration - Components of the group recognise income from profit share**
arrangements and trading deals. Revenue recognised under these arrangements is dependent on
satisfying performance obligations per underlying agreements and the amount and timing of revenue
recognition is inherently uncertain. Management apply judgement in estimating the related variable
consideration, which is measured on a best estimate basis through applying assumptions including
loss ratios and claims handling costs; and

**Revaluation of Swinton monthly products asset-The Swinton business acquired on 31 December**
2018 has significant trail commissions arising from certain products that renew monthly. Under
acquisition accounting the amounts receivable were estimated and fair valued using a discounted
cashflow model over the expected life of each type of product. At the year end, this receivable is
revalued and any revaluation movements are recorded as Other income.

Management applies judgement in calculating the present value of future cash flows, including past
experience, a best estimate of any associated risks, product lifetime restrictions, expected customer
cancellation profiles and potential persistency of products. We focus our testing on the most
judgemental assumptions being the customer cancellation profiles and product lifetime restrictions.

Refer to Note 3 to the financial statements (Accounting policies), Note 4 to the financial statements
(Key sources of estimation uncertainty) and Note 5 to the financial statements (Segmental analysis).

How the scope of our audit We have gained an understanding of management's process for recording revenue across the
responded to the key audit group's components and obtained an understanding of relevant controls.
**matter**
In addition, we performed the following audit procedures:

**Estimation of variable consideration:**

We evaluated corroborating and contradictory third party evidence to support revenue
recognition and compared recorded revenues with the contractual agreements;

We tested the appropriateness of a sample of input data;

We assessed evidence after the balance sheet date to conclude on the reliability of the year end
estimate; and

We tested the appropriateness of management's assumptions in calculating the estimate.

**Revaluation of Swinton monthly products asset**

We built our own replicating model using management's assumptions to recalculate the fair
value of the Swinton monthly products asset and thus demonstrate the accuracy of the model
used by management;

We tested the completeness and accuracy of data inputs into the model through agreement of a
sample to policy documentation;

We tested key assumptions included within the model, being: the product lifetime restrictions;
and the customer cancellation profiles. We tested the accuracy of the 2021 customer
cancellation forecast made at the end of 2020 with a hindsight analysis; and

We involved our general insurance regulation specialists in assessing the product lifetime
restrictions given existing market practice and the potential impacts of the FCA market study
into general insurance pricing practices.


**Estimation of variable consideration - Components of the group recognise income from profit share**


-----

**Key observations** We concluded estimated variable consideration balances recorded by management are appropriate.

Our testing of customer cancellation profiles supported by retrospective analysis of the cancellation
profiles forecast for 2021 did not identify any issues. We concluded that the expected product
lifetimes used in the valuation are reasonable.

**5.6 Preference share issue - Classification as equity or debt G)**

**Key audit matter** During the year HPS Investment Partners LLC ('HPS') committed a £350m equity investment in the
**description** group. This was achieved through issuing 350,000 E shares of nominal value £0.01 - the preference
shares. Contracts were exchanged in August 2021 and the investment completed in September 2021.

IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation requires an issuer of a financial instrument to classify the
financial instrument, or its component parts, as a financial liability or as equity in accordance with
the substance of the contractual arrangement and the definitions of a financial liability and an equity
instrument.

The Articles of Association and subscription agreement set out key terms relating to the preference
share issue, specifically relating to key IAS 32 assessment criteria being:

Contractual obligations to pay dividends and interest;
Contractual obligations governing redemption of the preference shares; and
Contractual arrangements in the form of put options over the preference shares.

Management has concluded its assessment and classified these preference shares as equity. There is
a risk that the terms of the contract, which are complex, mean the preference shares do not meet
the definition of equity and should be recorded as debt.

Refer to Note 4 to the financial statements (Key accounting judge�ents).

**How the scope of our audit** We performed the following audit procedures:
responded to the key audit
**matter** We reviewed the Articles of association and subscription agreement to identify key terms
relating to the preference share issue;

We evaluated management's accounting assessment that the preference shares are equity;

We tested preference shares issued to signed agreement and cash receipts; and

We assessed the financial statement disclosure as a key accounting judgement.


**5.6 Preference share issue - Classification as equity or debt G)**


**Key observations**


Based on the relevant contractual obligations as set out on the Articles of Association and
subscription agreement we concur with management's assessment that the preference shares are
classified as equity.


6. Our application of materiality

**6.1. Materiality**
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the economic
decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the
scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work.

Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:


-----

**Parent company financial statements**

£8.lm (2020: £5.2m)

0.79% of Parent company net assets (2020: 0.65%).
We apply a materiality cap for the parent company
to be lower than the group at 90%.

Net assets is determined to be the materiality
benchmark given the activities of the company. A
non-trading holding company with principal
activities being to hold intercompany subordinated
debt and investment in subsidiaries.

report to the Audit Committee on disclosure matters that we identified when assessing the overall presentation of the financial
statements.

7. An overview of the scope of our audit

**7.1. Identification and scoping of components**

Our group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the group and its environment, including group-wide controls,
and assessing the risks of material misstatement at the group level.

Given the number of components and operating locations within the group, we assessed the extent of audit work required to
be performed to give appropriate coverage for the purposes of the group financial statement audit. Our approach considered
revenue contribution to the group result as primary measure of financial significance and scope, and cash as a secondary
balance sheet measure given the significance of the cash balance to the operational activities of wider group. Coverage
obtained on this basis was 82% (2020: 92%) of Revenue and 84% of cash (2020: 90% of group total assets).

Of the group's 18 significant components, 9 were subjected to full scope audits of the financial information of the component
and 9 subjected to an audit of one or more account balances, classes of transactions or disclosures. Those subjected to an audit
of one or more account balances, classes of transactions or disclosures are not individually financially significant enough to
require full scope audit of the financial information of the component for group purposes, but did present specific areas of risk
which needed to be addressed.

At the group level we also tested the consolidation process and carried out analytical procedures to confirm our conclusion
that there were no significant risks of material misstatement of the aggregated financial information of the remaining
components not subject to a full audit.

**7.2. Working with other auditors**

Work on two components, Arachas Corporate Brokers (Ireland) and Resilium (Australia), were undertaken by Deloitte overseas
component audit teams. Work on a single component Ed Broking and Besso Insurance ("Ed Besso") is performed by a different
audit firm, EV.

We directed and supervised the component teams in the performance of their work through providing detailed instructions
setting out the work to be performed, having regular conference calls with the team throughout the audit and by performing a
review of their audit working papers over a video conference.

8. Other information

The other information comprises the information included in the annual report, other than the financial statements and our
auditor's report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information contained within the annual report.

-----

Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly
stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially
inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit, or otherwise appears to be
materially misstated.

If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether this
gives rise to a material misstatement in the financial statements themselves. If, based on the work we have performed, we
conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.

We have nothing to report in this regard.

9. Responsibilities of directors

As explained more fully in the directors' responsibilities statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the
financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as th_e directors
determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether
due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group's and the parent company's ability
to continue as a going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of
accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have no
realistic alternative but to do so.

10. Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance
is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a
material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually
or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these
financial statements.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the FRC's website at:
www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor's report.

11. Extent to which the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud

Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with
our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud. The extent to
which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below.

**11.1. Identifying and assessing potential risks related to irregularities**
In identifying and assessing risks of material misstatement in respect of irregularities, including fraud and non-compliance with
laws and regulations, we considered the following:

   - the nature of the industry and sector, control environment and business performance including the design of the
group's remuneration policies, key drivers for directors' remuneration, bonus levels and performance targets;

   - results of our enquiries of management, internal audit and the audit committee about their own identification and
assessment of the risks of irregularities;

   - any matters we identified having obtained and reviewed the group's documentation of their policies and procedures
relating to:

o identifying, evaluating and complying with laws and regulations and whether they were aware of any instances
of non-compliance;


conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.

We have nothing to report in this regard.

9. Responsibilities of directors


-----

o detecting and responding to the risks of fraud and whether they have knowledge of any actual, suspected or
alleged fraud;

o the internal controls established to mitigate risks of fraud or non-compliance with laws and regulations;

   - the matters discussed among the audit engagement team including significant component audit teams and relevant
internal specialists, including tax, valuations, IT, and industry specialists regarding how and where fraud might occur
in the financial statements and any potential indicators of fraud.

As a result of these procedures, we considered the opportunities and incentives that may exist within the organisation for
fraud and identified the greatest potential for fraud in the following areas: Goodwill impairment, Acquisition accounting,
Presentation of APMs, and Revenue recognition. In common with all audits under ISAs (UK), we are also required to perform
specific procedures to respond to the risk of management override.

We also obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory framework that the group operates in, focusing on provisions of
those laws and regulations that had a direct effect on the determination of material amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. The key laws and regulations we considered in this context included the UK Companies Act.

In addition, we considered provisions of other laws and regulations that do not have a direct effect on the financial statements
but compliance with which may be fundamental to the group's ability to operate or to avoid a material penalty. These included
the group's FCA permissions and compliance with FCA client assets regulations.

**11.2. Audit response to risks identified**

As a result of performing the above, we identified Goodwill impairment, Acquisition accounting under IFRS 3 Business
Combinations - Bravo, Presentation of AP Ms, Revenue recognition - Estimation of Variable Consideration reported in
Commissions and fees and revaluation of the trail commission asset acquired with Swinton ("Swinton Monthly Products asset")
reported in Other income as key audit matters related to the potential risk of fraud. The key audit matters section of our report
explains the matters in more detail and also describes the specific procedures we performed in response to those key audit
matters.

In addition to the above, our procedures to respond to risks identified included the following:

   - reviewing the financial statement disclosures and testing to supporting documentation to assess compliance with
provisions of relevant laws and regulations described as having a direct effect on the financial statements;

   - enquiring of management, the audit committee and in-house legal counsel concerning actual and potential litigation
and claims;

   - performing analytical procedures to identify any unusual or unexpected relationships that may indicate risks of
material misstatement due to fraud;

   - reading minutes of meetings of those charged with governance, reviewing internal audit reports and reviewing
correspondence with the FCA;

   - in addressing the risk of fraud through management override of controls, testing the appropriateness of journal
entries and other adjustments; assessing whether the judgements made in making accounting estimates are
indicative of a potential bias; and evaluating the business rationale of any significant transactions that are unusual or
outside the normal course of business.
We also communicated relevant identified laws and regulations and potential fraud risks to all engagement team members
including internal specialists and significant component audit teams, and remained alert to any indications of fraud or non­
compliance with laws and regulations throughout the audit.

Report on other legal and regulatory requirements

12. Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006


In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:


-----

13. Matters on which we are required to report by exception

**13.1. Adequacy of explanations received and accounting records**
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:

   - we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or

   - adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not
been received from branches not visited by us; or

   - the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.

We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.

**13.2. Directors' remuneration**
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to report if in our opinion certain disclosures of directors' remuneration
have not been made.

We have nothing to report in respect of this matter.

14. Use of our report

This report is made solely to the company's members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies
Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company's members those matters we are
required to state to them in an auditor's report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not
accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company's members as a body, for our audit
work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

###### FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**1** **General information**

Ardonagh Midco 2 pie (the Company) was incorporated on the 20 March 2017 as a public company limited by shares with
registered number 10679958. It is incorporated and domiciled in the UK. The address of its registered office is 2 Minster Court,
London, EC3R 7PD. The principal business activities of the Company and its subsidiaries are described in the Directors' Report.


-----

###### FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**2** **Basis of preparation**

The consolidated financial statements comprise the Company ancl its subsidiaries (the Group) and have been prepared in
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the United Kingdom (UK-adopted IFRS) and the
Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.

The consolidated financial statements are presented in GBP (£).

Amounts shown are rounded to the nearest thousand, unless stated otherwise.

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified to use a different
measurement basis where necessary to comply with IFRS.

The Directors have considered the guida nee of the UK Financial Reporting Council and events relating to the spread of coronavirus
(Covid-19) in preparing these financial statements.

Going concern
At 31 December 2021, the Group had net assets of £83.8m (31 December 2020 net liabilities: £141.4m) and net current assets
of £368.2m (31 December 2020: £159.0m). The Group reported an operating profit of £102.8m for the year ended 31 December
2021 {31 December 2020: £54.lm), net cash inflows from operating activities of £688.Sm (31 December 2020: £152.8m), cash
inflows of £754.lm {31 December 2020: £177.lm) and operating cash conversion of 96% {31 December 2020: 97%). Available
cash of £411.3m was reported on 31 December 2021 {31 December 2020: £154.Sm).

The Directors have assessed the Group's financial position and its ability to meet its obligations as and when they fall due. In
making the going concern assessment the Directors have taken into account the following:

  - The Group's capital structure, operations and liquidity following the 14 July 2020 issuance of new borrowings; £343.0m
received for the 350,000 preference shares issued on 3 September 2021; and the additional 19 August 2021 Capex,
Acquisition and Re-organisation facility (CAR upsize) of circa £565.0m agreed with the lenders of the Group's privately
placed term loan facility due 2026 (see Business Review: Liquidity and Capital Resources), of which £164.3m remains
undrawn at the date of this report. These are reflected in the adjusted base case and stressed cash flow forecasts over
the calendar years 2022 and 2023.

  - The impact on the base case cashflow forecasts arising from material acquisitions since the finalisation of the Group's
base case budget.

  - The principal risks facing the Group, including global political tensions (including related to the Ukrainian conflict) and
potential residual financial impacts of Covid-19 following lockdown restrictions being removed in the UK, and its systems
of risk management and internal control.

  - Actual trading and cashflows that arose in the two months ended February 2022, with continued positive financial results.


-----

###### FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**2** **Basis of preparation**

Key assumptions that the Directors have made in preparing the base case cash flow forecasts are that:

  - Following the 14 July 2020 issuance of new borrowings, which the Group used to repay its existing borrowings and to
fund acquisitions: (a) the Group will continue to benefit from a £191.Sm Revolving Credit Facility that is not drawn at the
date of this report, and (b) payment-in-kind interest options are utilised.

  - Client retention and renewal rates continue to be robust, despite the current economic uncertainty, as the 2021 trading
performance continues to demonstrate resilience across the Group.

Key stress scenarios that the Directors have considered include cumulative stresses to the base plan as a result of:

  - Shortfalls in base case projected income throughout 2022 and 2023.

  - Deterioration in base case cash conversion rates over and above the shortfalls in income.

  - Mitigating actions within management control including delayed capital expenditure, a reduction in discretionary spend
and some reduction in employee headcount and remuneration.

The Directors have also modelled reverse stress scenarios, including assessing those that result in a default on our term debt
facilities that would require a technical repayment obligation and those that would exhaust available liquidity. The stresses
needed for these outcomes to happen significantly exceed the key stress scenarios above and the Directors consider such
conditions to be a remote possibility. Other mitigations which may be possible in the stress scenarios but have not been included
in the analysis include seeking shareholder support, securitising premium receivables and further incremental and more
prolonged cost reductions.

The Directors continue to consider the wider operational consequences and ramifications of global political tensions (including
related to the Ukrainian conflict) and residual impacts from the Covid-19 pandemic. In particular:

  - The Group has demonstrated the efficiency and stability of the Group's infrastructure and the ability for home working
for a significant portion of our employee base.

  - Insurance broking is a resilient and defensive market, which has historically had limited impact from past economic or
capital market downturns. The Group is highly diversified and not materially exposed to a single carrier, customer or
market sector.

  - Although Covid-19 developments remain fluid, the stress testing demonstrates the Group's financial resilience and
operating flexibility.

Following the assessment of the Group's financial position and its ability to meet its obligations as and when they fall due,
including the further potential financial implications of economic uncertainty included in stress tests, and the wider operational
consequences and ramifications of the pandemic, the Directors are not aware of any material uncertainties that cast significant
doubt on the businesses of the Group's ability to continue as a going concern.

###### FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**3** **Accounting policies**

The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year with the exception of new standards
effective from 1 January 2021 as described in 'Application of new and revised International Financial Reporting Standards'
(section (r) below). Additional accounting policies have been incorporated in 2021 as necessary as a result of transactions and
acquisitions during the year.

**(al • Basis of consolidation**

The Group consolidates those investees that it is deemed to control, referred to as subsidiaries. The Group has control over an
investee if all three of the following are met: (i) it has power over the investee, (ii) it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable
returns from its involvement with the investee, and (iii) it has ability to use its power over the investee to affect the amount of
its own returns. The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered
when assessing whether the Group controls another entity.

Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. The assets, liabilities, profits and losses
of the subsidiary are added line by line to those of the Group.

lntercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains and losses on transactions between Group companies are eliminated.

Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the
Group.

_Accounting for business combinations_
The Group uses the acquisition method of accounting to account for business combinations. The consideration transferred for
the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair value of the assets transferred, the liabilities assumed and the equity interests issued by
the Group. The consideration transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration
arrangement. Identifiable assets acquired, and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed, in a business combination are
measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. The Group recognises any non-controlling interest in the acquiree
at the non-controlling interest's proportionate share of the acquiree's net assets.

Acquisition-related costs, except costs to issue debt or equity securities, are expensed as incurred.

If a business combination is achieved in stages, the acquirer's previously held equity interest in the acquiree is re-measured to
fair value at the acquisition date through profit or loss.

Some acquisitions involve a put and/or call option. A put option gives the seller the right to require the Group to acquire its
shareholdings in the acquiree at a future date. A call option gives the Group the right to require the seller to sell its shareholdings
in the acquiree to the Group. The put and/or call options are usually exercisable within specified time periods. The exercise price
of the options is usually based on a multiple of EBITDA, net of the net debt of the acquiree for the financial year that immediately
precedes the financial year in which the option is exercised. The Group recognises a financial liability where there is a put option,
at an amount corresponding to the present value of the option price {the redemption amount), and that liability is classified as
'Share buyout' in the financial statements.

Subsequent changes to the fair value of deferred consideration, contingent consideration or the share buyout balance are
recognised in accordance with IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments' in profit or loss, unless the changes occur during the 'measurement
period' of up to one year following the acquisition date and are the result of additional information that the acquirer has obtained
after the acquisition date about facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date. Contingent consideration that is
classified as equity is not re-measured, and its subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity.


-----

###### FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**3** **Accounting policies (continued}**

_Disposal of subsidiaries_
Where the Group disposes of its controlling interest in a subsidiary, the assets and liabilities are derecognised along with any
related non-controlling interest and other components of equity. Any resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss. Any
interest retained in the former subsidiary is measured at fair value when control is lost.

_Goodwill_
Goodwill is initially measured as the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred and of the non-controlling interest
over the fair value of the net of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If goodwill is negative (i.e. a shortfall
instead of an excess), it is recognised in profit or loss.

Goodwill acquired in the period represents expected synergies from combining operations of the acquiree and the Group, and
intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition.

Goodwill is tested annually for impairment and is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Gains and losses on the
disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold. Goodwill is allocated to cash generating
units for the purposes of impairment testing.

_Transactions with non-controlling interests_
Transactions with non-controlling interests that do not result in the loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions.

(bl **Investments in associates and joint ventures**

_Associates_
An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence and that is neither a subsidiary nor an interest in a joint
arrangement. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but
is not control nor joint control over those policies.

The results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in the consolidated financial statements as a single line in each
of the statement of financial position and the statement of profit or loss using the equity method of accounting. The consolidated
statement of financial position therefore includes investment in associates measured at cost as adjusted for post-acquisition
changes in the Group's economic share of the net assets of the associate, less any impairment in the value of the investment, but
the carrying amount cannot fall below zero. The consolidated income statement includes a share of the profit or loss of the
associate.

_Joint arrangements_
The Group applies IFRS 11 'Joint Arrangements' to all joint arrangements. Investments in joint arrangements are, as required by
IFRS 11, classified as either joint operations or joint ventures, depending on the contractual rights and obligations of each
investor. The Group has assessed the nature of its joint arrangements and has determined them to be joint ventures. Joint
ventures are accounted for using the equity method, in a similar manner to associates.

**(cl Intangible assets**

_Customer relationships_

Customer relationship intangible assets are recognised on a business combination because the acquirer is able to benefit from
selling future new business through existing relationships. Their fair value is calculated as the sum of the present value of
projected cash flows in excess of returns on contributory assets over the life of the relationship with the customers. These assets
are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of between 5 and 10 years, which is estimated by reference
to the history of the relationships and levels of attrition.

_Distribution network_
Distribution network intangible assets are recognised on a business combination because the acquirer is able to benefit from
already established distribution channels. Their fair value is calculated as the sum of the present value of projected future cash
flows generated by existing distribution channels. These assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful
lives of 10 years, which is estimated by reference to the history of the relationships and levels of attrition.

_Brond_
Brand intangible assets are recognised on a business combination because they are separable or arise from contractual or other
legal rights. Their fair value is calculated as the sum of the present value of projected royalty payments that would be paid to
licence the right to use the brand. These assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over. their estimated useful lives of between
1 and 10 years, which considers the Group's track record of retaining brands and experience of the insurance broking market.

_Computer software_
Computer software is recognised when purchased separately, when acquired as part of a business combination, or when
internally-generated. The fair value of computer software that is purchased separately is calculated by reference to the amount
paid. The fair value of computer software that is acquired as part of a business combination is calculated using the depreciated
replacement cost or relief from royalty approach. The fair value of internally-generated computer software is calculated as
described below. These assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life of 4 years.

_lnternally-qeneroted computer software and assets under construction (unless acquired on a business combination/_
Expenditure on research activities is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.

An internally-generated intangible asset arising from the development of computer software is recognised if, and only if, all the
following conditions have been demonstrated:

  - the technical feasibility of completing the asset so that it will be available for use or sale;

  - the intention to complete the asset and to use or sell it;

  - the ability to use or sell the asset;

  - how the asset will generate future economic benefits;

  - the availability of adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the
asset; and

  - the ability to measure reliably the expenditure attributable to the asset during its development.

The amount initially recognised is the sum of the expenditure incurred from the date when the intangible asset first meets the
recognition criteria listed above and is classified as an asset under construction. Where no internally-generated intangible asset
can be recognised, development expenditure is recognised in profit or loss in the period in which it is incurred.

Internally-generated intangible assets are not amortised in the period subsequent to initial recognition but before they are ready
for use. Amortisation commences when they are ready for use as intended by management. They are then reported at cost less
accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, on the same basis as intangible assets that are acquired
separately. Internally-generated intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life of 4 years.

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**3** **Accounting policies (continued)**

_Intellectual property_
Intellectual property assets include a bespoke database and online platform. These assets are amortised on a straight-line basis
over their estimated useful life of 4 years.

_Derecoqnition ofintanqible assets_
An intangible asset is derecognised on disposal, or when no future economic benefits are expected from use or disposal. Gains
or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset, measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and
the carrying amount of the asset, are recognised in profit or loss when the asset is derecognised.

_Impairment of assets_
Intangible assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment. Assets
that are subject to amortisation or depreciation are reviewed for impairment at each statement of financial position date or
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is
recognised for the amount by which the asset's carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the
higher of an asset's fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. If it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of
an individual asset, the recoverable amount of the 'cash generating unit' to which the asset belongs is determined, being the
lowest level for which there are separately identifiable cash flows.

Any impairment charges arising from the review of the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets are, where material,
disclosed separately on the face of the consolidated income statement.

**Id) Depreciation**

Assets are stated at their net book value (historical cost less accumulated depreciation). Depreciation is calculated to write off
the cost of such assets on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. At the reporting date, the Group's principal rates
of depreciation were as follows:
Freehold buildings - over 50 years (except integral features which are over 20 years)
Leasehold improvements - over the remaining life of the lease
Furniture and equipment - over 4 years
Computer equipment - over 4 years
Fixtures and fittings - over 4 years
Motor vehicles - over 4 years

The assets' residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each reporting period.
Property, plant and equipment is derecognised on disposal, or when no future economic benefits are expected from use or
disposal. Gains or losses arising from derecognition of property, plant and equipment, measured as the difference between the
net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset, are recognised in profit or loss when the asset is derecognised.

###### FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**3** **Accounting policies (continued)**

**(el Leases**

The Group accounts for lease and non-lease components in a contract as a single lease component.

Right-of-use assets
The Group recognises right-of-use assets at the commencement date of the lease (i.e. the date the underlying asset is available
for use). Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and are adjusted
for certain remeasurement_s of the lease liabilities. The cost of right-of-use assets includes the amount of lease liabilities
recognised, initial direct costs incurred, lease payments made at or before the commencement date of the lease less any lease
incentives received, plus the estimated costs of restoring the underlying asset to the condition required by the terms of the lease.
Unless the Group is reasonably certain to obtain ownership of the leased asset at the end of the lease term, the recognised right­
of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the estimated useful life and the lease term. Right-of­
use assets are subject to impairment.

Lease liabilities·
At the commencement date of the lease, the Group recognises lease liabilities measured at the present value of lease payments
to be made over the lease term. The lease payments include fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments) less any
lease incentives receivable, variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, and amounts expected to be paid under
residual value guarantees. The lease payments also include the exercise price of a purchase option reasonably certain to be
exercised by the Group and payments of penalties for terminating a lease if the lease term reflects the Group exercising the
option to terminate. The variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognised as an expense in the
period on which the event or condition that triggers the payment occurs.

In calculating the present value of lease payments, the Group uses the incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement
date if the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable, which is generally the case. After the commencement
date, the amount of lease liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of interest and it is reduced for the lease payments made.
In addition, the carrying amount of lease liabilities is remeasured if there is a modification, a change in the lease term, a change
in the in-substance fixed lease payments or a change in the assessment to purchase the underlying asset.

Leases of low value assets
The Group elects on a lease-by-lease basis whether to apply the lease of low-value assets exemption to non-property leases that
are considered to be of low value (i.e. below £5,000). Where the exemption is applied, lease payments on leases of low-value
assets are recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

Subleases
The Group does not undertake arrangements as a lessor other than as a sublessor. When the Group is a sublessor, it classifies
the sublease as a finance lease if the sublease transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the asset
that is the subject of the sublease, namely the right-of-use asset arising from the head lease. The sublease is otherwise classified
as an operating lease.

###### FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**3** **Accounting policies (continued)**

**(fl Financial instruments**

Recognition and initial measurement
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the
financial instrument, and they are measured initially at fair value. Transaction costs arising on the issue of a financial asset or
financial liability are accounted for as follows:

  - Transaction costs are added to or deducted from the fair value of the financial asset or financial liability if they are directly
attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset or financial liability, respectively, and if the financial asset is measured
at fair value through other comprehensive income or if the financial asset or financial liability, respectively, is measured
at amortised cost.

  - Transaction costs are recognised immediately in profit or loss if they are directly attributable to the issue of a financial
asset or financial liability at fair value through profit or loss, or if they are not directly attributable to the issue of a financial
asset or financial liability.

Derecognition
Financial assets are derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire, or the Group
transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which substantially all of the risks and rewards of
ownership of the financial asset are transferred.

On derecognition of a financial asset measured at amortised cost, the difference between the asset's carrying amount and the
sum of the consideration received and receivable is recognised in profit or loss. On derecognition of an investment in an equity
instrument which the Group has elected on initial recognition to measure at fair value through other comprehensive income, the
cumulative gain or loss previously accumulated in equity is not reclassified to profit or loss but is included in retained earnings.

A financial liability is derecognised when it is extinguished, discharged, cancelled or expires. The difference between the carrying
value of the financial liability and the consideration paid and payable, including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities
assumed, is recognised in profit or loss. Where an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on
substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is
treated as a derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability.

Offsetting
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset, and the net amount presented in the statement of financial position when, and
only when, the Group currently has a legally enforceable right to set off the amounts and it intends either to settle them on a
net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

Classification and subsequent measurement of financial assets
The Group classifies its financial assets in the following measurement categories:

  - Amortised cost;

  - Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI); or

  - Fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL).
All recognised financial assets are subsequently measured in their entirety at either amortised cost or fair value, depending on
their classification.


-----

###### FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**3** **Accounting policies (continued)**

_Financial assets classified as amortised cost_
Financial assets that meet the following conditions are classified and subsequently measured at amortised cost:

  - the financial asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual
cash flows; and
o the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal
and interest on the principal amount outstanding.

The amortised cost of a financial asset is the amount at which the financial asset is measured at initial recognition minus the
principal repayments, plus the cumulative amortisation using the effective interest method of any difference between that initial
amount and the maturity amount, adjusted for any loss allowance.

The Group's financial assets measured at amortised cost include trade and other receivables (except for certain other receivables
measured at FVTPL, see below), advances to related parties, cash and cash equivalents and certain other financial assets.

The Group's trade receivables do not generally have a significant financing component, so their transaction (invoiced) price is
considered to be their amortised cost.

Insurance brokers act as agents in placing the insurable risks of their clients with insurers and, as such, are not usually liable as
principal for amounts arising from such transactions. In recognition of this relationship, debtors from insurance broking
transactions are not, in general, included as an asset of the Group. Other than the receivable for fees and commissions earned
on a transaction, recognition of the insurance transaction does not, in general, occur until the Group receives cash in respect of
premiums or claims, at which time a corresponding liability is established in favour of the insurer or the client. An exception
exists in relation to funded premium and claim items whereby the Group has a legal obligation to make good any shortfall to
client monies in the event of default.

In certain circumstances, the Group advances premiums, refunds or claims to insurers or clients prior to collection. These
advances are reflected in the consolidated statement of financial position as part of trade receivables.

_Financial assets classified as FVTOCI_
Financial assets are classified and subsequently measured at FVTOCI if they meet the criteria to be classified at amortised cost
except that the business model is to sell financial assets as well as to hold financial assets to collect contractual cash flows.

The Group may also irrevocably elect to classify and subsequently measure equity investments at FVTOCI. Gains and losses on
these equity instruments are never recycled to profit or loss. Dividend income from equity instruments measured at FVTOCI is
recognised in profit or loss as part of investment income when the right to payment has been established (provided that it is
probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and that the amount of income can be measured reliably), except
when the Group benefits from such proceeds as a recovery of part of the cost of the instrument, in which case, such gains are
recorded in other comprehensive income. The right to payment is established on the ex-dividend date for listed equity securities,
and usually on the date when shareholders approve the dividend for unlisted equity securities. Equity instruments at FVTOCI are
not subject to an impairment assessment.

The Group has designated all of its unlisted equity investments as at FVTOCI, because these investments were on initial
recognition held as long-term strategic investments that are not expected to be sold in the short to medium term.


-----

###### FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**3** **Accounting policies (continued)**

_Financial assets classified as FVTPL_
Financial assets that do not meet the criteria for being measured at amortised cost or FVTOCI are measured at FVTPL. Specifically:

  - Investments in equity instruments are classified as FVTPL, unless the Group designates an equity investment as FVTOCI
on initial recognition.

  - Debt instruments (including receivables) that do not meet the amortised cost criteria or the FVTOCI criteria are classified
as FVTPL.

Financial assets classified as FVTPL are recorded in the statement of financial position at fair value. Changes in fair value are
recorded in profit and loss to the extent they are not part of a designated hedging relationship.

The Group's Unregulated Collective Investment Scheme (UCIS) assets are classified as FVTPL. These assets do not meet the IFRS
9 'Financial Instruments' criteria for classification as amortised cost or FVTOCI, because their cashflows do not represent solely
payments of principal and interest. The Group has not designated any debt investments that meet the amortised cost or FVTOCI
criteria as being measured at FVTPL.

Other financial assets measured at FVTPL include convertible loan receivables, and receivables recognised on a business
combination in relation to the Group's right to variable consideration on rolling contracts with customers for which the
performance obligation was satisfied prior to the acquisition. These financial assets are not classified as amortised cost or FVTOCI
because their cash flows do not represent solely payments of principal and interest.

Foreign exchange gains and losses
The carrying amount of financial assets that are denominated in a foreign currency is determined in that foreign currency and
translated at the spot rate at the end of each reporting period. Specifically:

  - for equity instruments measured at FVTOCI, exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income; and

  - for all other financial assets that are not part of a designated hedging relationship, exchange differences are recognised
in profit or loss in the other operating costs line item.

Reclassifications
Financial assets are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition. They would only be reclassified if the Group were to
change its business model for managing its financial assets, in which case the affected financial assets would be reclassified
following that change.

Impairment of financial assets
The Group assesses, on a forward-looking basis, the expected credit losses ("ECL") associated with its financial assets carried at
amortised cost. The Group recognises a loss allowance for such losses at each reporting date.

The Group recognises lifetime ECL for trade and other receivables. The expected credit losses on these financial assets are
estimated using a provision matrix based on the Group's historical credit loss experience, adjusted for factors that are specific to
the debtors and by scalar factors to reflect differences between economic conditions during the period over which the historical
data was collected versus current conditions and the Group's view of economic conditions over the expected lives of the
receivables, including the time value of money where appropriate. Scalar factors are typically based on GDP and unemployment
rate forecasts.

For all other financial instruments, the Group recognises lifetime ECL when there has been a significant increase in credit risk
since initial recognition. If, on the other hand, the credit risk on the financial instrument has not increased significantly since
initial recognition, the Group measures the loss allowance for that financial instrument at an amount equal to 12 months ECL.

The Group assumes that the credit risk on a financial instrument has not increased significantly since initial recognition if the
financial instrument is determined to have low credit risk at the reporting date. A financial instrument is determined to have low
credit risk if (i) the financial instrument has a low risk of default, (ii) the borrower has a strong capacity to meet its contractual
cash flow obligations in the near term, and (iii) adverse changes in economic and business conditions in the longer term may, but
will not necessarily, reduce the ability of the borrower to fulfil its contractual cash flow obligations.

All cash and cash equivalents are assessed to have low credit risk at each reporting date as they are held with reputable banks
and financial institution counterparties with, wherever possible, a minimum single A credit rating from both Moody's and S&P.
The Group measures the loss allowance for such assets at an amount equal to 12 months ECL.

ECL is estimated as the difference between all contractual cash flows that are due to the Group in accordance with the contract
and all the cash flows that the Group expects to receive, discounted at the original effective interest rate.

Lifetime ECL represents the expected credit losses that will result from all possible default events over the expected life of a
financial instrument. 12 months ECL represents the portion of lifetime ECL that is expected to result from default events on a
financial instrument that are possible within 12 months after the reporting date.

Lifetime ECL is measured on a collective basis to cater for cases where evidence of significant increases in credit risk at the
individual instrument level may not yet be available.

Definition of default
The Group considers the following as constituting an event of default for internal credit risk management purposes as historical
experience indicates that receivables that meet either of the following criteria are generally not recoverable:

   - when there is a breach of financial covenants by the counterparty; or

   - information developed internally or obtained from external sources indicates that the debtor is unlikely to pay its
creditors, including the Group, in full.

Irrespective of the above analysis, the Group considers that default has occurred when a financial asset is more than 90 days past
due unless the Group has reasonable and supportable information to demonstrate that a longer or shorter default criterion is
more appropriate.

Credit-impaired financial assets
A financial asset is credit-impaired when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows
of that financial asset have occurred. Evidence that a financial asset is credit-impaired includes observable data about the
following events:

   - significant financial difficulty of the counterparty;

   - a breach of contract, such as a default or past due event;

   - the lender(s) of the counterparty, for economic or contractual reasons relating to the counterparty's financial difficulty,
having granted to the counterparty a concession that the lender(s) would not otherwise consider;

   - it is becoming probable that the counterparty will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation; or

   - the disappearance of an active market for that financial asset because of the financial difficulties.

Write-off policy
The Group writes off a trade receivable when there is information indicating that the debtor is in severe financial difficulty and
there is no realistic prospect of recovery, e.g. when the debtor has been placed under liquidation or has entered into bankruptcy
proceedings, or when the trade receivables are over two years past due, whichever occurs earlier. A write-off constitutes a
derecognition event. Financial assets written **_off may still be subject to enforcement activities under the Group's recovery_**
procedures, taking into account legal advice where appropriate. Any recoveries made are recognised in profit or loss.

Classification and subsequent measurement of financial liabilities
All financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method or at FVTPL.

Financial liabilities are classified and measured as FVTPL when (i) the financial liability is deferred consideration, contingent
consideration or a share buyout balance relating to a business combination to which IFRS 3 applies, or (ii) it is a derivative.

Financial liabilities at FVTPL are stated at fair value with any gains or losses arising on changes in fair value recognised in profit
or loss to the extent that they are not part of a designated hedging relationship. The net gain or loss recognised in profit or loss
incorporates any interest paid on the financial liabilities.

For financial liabilities that are denominated in a foreign currency that are not part of a designated hedging relationship, the
foreign exchange gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss.

The Group's financial liabilities include borrowings, trade and other payables, derivatives, deferred consideration, contingent
consideration and a share buyout balance.

_Borrowings_
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for
at least 12 months after the statement of financial position date. Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of
transaction costs incurred. They are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.

_Trade payables_
Trade payables are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost.

Derivative financial instruments
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value at each
reporting date. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss immediately unless the derivative is designated and
effective as a hedging instrument, in which case the timing of the recognition in profit or loss depends on the nature of the hedge
relationship.

The fair values of various derivative financial instruments used for hedging purposes are disclosed in note 26 hedge accounting.
Movements in the cash flow hedging reserve in shareholders' equity are included in the consolidated statement of changes in
equity.

Deferred .consideration contingent consideration and share buyout balance
The Group is party to consideration arrangements in the form of deferred consideration, contingent consideration and a share
buyout balance. Deferred consideration represents fixed or determinable amounts payable at a specified date in the future.
Contingent consideration is consideration that is contingent on a future event, usually the future performance of the acquired
business. Share buyout arises as a result of put options held by minority shareholders of acquired businesses. These liabilities are
recognised initially at their discounted present value and are remeasured at each reporting date. The discount unwind and the
remeasurement of these liabilities are recognised in profit or loss as finance cost.

Cash flow hedges
The Group enters into forward contracts to manage its exposure to foreign exchange rate risks. The Group also enters into
interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate risks. The Group designates these derivatives as cash flow hedges,
being hedges of a particular risk associated with the cash flows of recognised liabilities and highly probable forecast transactions.

At the inception of such hedging transactions the Group documents whether the hedging instrument is effective in offsetting
changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, which is when the hedging relationships
meet all of the following hedge effectiveness requirements:

   - there is an economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument;

   - the effect of credit risk does not dominate the value changes that result from that economic relationship; and

   - the hedge ratio of the hedging relationship is the same as that resulting from the quantity of the hedged item that the
Group actually hedges and the quantity of the hedging instrument that the entity actually uses to hedge that quantity of
hedged item.

If a hedging relationship ceases to meet the hedge effectiveness requirement relating to the hedge ratio but the risk
management objective for that designated hedging relationship remains the same, the Group adjusts the hedge ratio of the
hedging relationship (i.e. rebalances the hedge) so that it meets the qualifying criteria again.

When a derivative is designated as a cash flow hedging instrument, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivative
instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated
under the heading of cash flow hedging reserve. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative that is
recognised in other comprehensive income is limited to the cumulative change in fair value of the hedged item, determined on
a present value basis, from inception of the hedge. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately
in profit or loss and is included in finance costs for the derivatives that hedge borrowings and in other operating costs for the
derivatives that hedge revenue.

Amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity are reclassified to profit or loss in the
periods when the hedged item affects profit or loss, included in the same line as that which the hedged item affects.

Furthermore, if the Group expects that some or all of the loss accumulated in other comprehensive income will not be recovered
in the future, that amount is immediately reclassified to profit or loss.

The Group discontinues hedge accounting only when the hedging relationship (or a part thereof) ceases to meet the qualifying
criteria (after rebalancing, if applicable). This includes instances when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or
exercised. The discontinuation is accounted for prospectively. Any gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income and
accumulated in equity at that time remains in equity and is reclassified to profit or loss when the forecast transaction is ultimately
recognised in profit or loss. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the gain or loss accumulated in equity is
recognised immediately in profit or loss.

###### FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**3** **Accounting policies (continued)**

_Derivatives hedging borrowings_
The Group's risk management policy is to hedge its foreign currency exposure to its USO denominated borrowings, where there
is no offsetting foreign currency exposure from its investments funded by those borrowings.

For the cross currency swaps (before they were all settled in 2020) and the forward contracts hedging borrowings, the Group
separates the foreign currency basis spread and forward points from the derivative and excludes it from the designation of that
financial instrument as the hedging instrument. The fair value changes in the currency basis spread and forward points are
separately accounted for as a cost of hedging in other comprehensive income and recognised in the costs of hedging reserve
within equity. Such costs of hedging are amortised (i.e. reclassified to profit or loss) over the life of the hedged borrowings (or
when the hedge is de-designated). The treatment for the currency basis element and forward points is optional and the option
is applied on a hedge by hedge basis.

The Group uses the hypothetical derivative method to determine the changes in fair value of the hedged item. The Group
assesses hedge effectiveness by comparing the changes in fair value of a hypothetical derivative reflecting the terms of the
foreign currency debt security issued due to movements in the foreign currency rate with the changes in fair value of the
derivatives used to hedge the exposure.

The Group determines the hedge ratio by comparing the notional of the derivatives with the principal of the debt securities
issued. The Group has identified the following possible sources of ineffectiveness in these cash flow hedge relationships:

  - The use of cross currency derivatives and forward contracts as a protection against currency risk creates an exposure to
the derivative counterparty's credit risk which is not offset by the hedged item. This risk is minimised by entering into
contracts with high credit quality counterparties;

  - The use of different discounting curves for the hedged item and the hedging instrument, because for the derivatives the
discounting curve used depends on collateralisation and the type of collateral used; and

  - Designation of off-market hedging instruments.

No other sources of ineffectiveness affected these hedge relationships. The Group has not designated any net positions as
hedged items on cash flow hedges of foreign currency risk.

_Derivatives hedging revenue_
The Group's risk management policy is to hedge 80%, 65% and 50% of its estimated foreign currency exposure in respect of
forecast revenue (except where offset by foreign currency costs) over the following 12, 24 and 36 months respectively. Hedges
mature monthly and new hedges are added on a rolling quarterly basis.

The Group's policy is for the critical terms of the forward contracts to align with the hedged item. The Group determines the
existence of an economic relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item based on the currency, amount and
timing of their respective cash flows. The Group assesses whether the derivative designated in each hedging relationship is
expected to be and has been effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged item using the hypothetical derivative
method.

In these hedge relationships, the main sources of ineffectiveness are:

  - The effect of the counterparty and the Group's own credit risk on the fair value of the forward contracts, which is not
reflected in the change in the fair value of the hedged cash flows attributable to the change in exchange rates;

  - The use of different discounting curves for the hedged item and the hedging instrument, because for the derivatives the
discounting curve used depends on collateralisation and the type of collateral used; and

  - Changes in the timing of the hedged transactions.

For the forward contracts hedging revenue, the Group designates the entire hedging instrument (i.e. the currency forward
inclusive of the forward element). Given the size of the notional, tenure and currency pairs involved in the currency forwards,
the forward points are not considered to be significant enough to warrant separation as costs of hedging and so are included in
the measurement of the hedged item.

###### FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**3** **Accounting policies (continued)**

Finance income and finance costs
The Group's finance income and finance costs include:

  - Interest income

  - Interest expense
e Interest on defined benefit pension schemes

  - Unwind of discount on provisions

  - Unwind of discount on financial assets or liabilities, including on lease liabilities and lease receivables

  - Unwind of discount and fair value remeasurement of deferred consideration, contingent consideration and the share
buyout balance

  - The net gain or loss reclassified from other comprehensive income to profit or loss in relation to derivatives hedging
borrowings

  - Gains and losses on convertible loan receivables

Interest income and expense are recognised using the effective interest method for debt instruments classified as amortised cost
and as FVTOCI.

**lgl Provisions for liabilities and charges**

A provision is recognised where there is a present obligation, whether legal or constructive, as a result of a past event for which
it is probable that a transfer of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reasonable estimate can be made
of the amount of the obligation.

The amount recognised ·as a provision is management's best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present
obligation at the statement of financial position date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation.

Where appropriate the Group discounts provisions to their present value. The unwinding of the provision discounting is included
as an interest charge within finance costs in the income statement.

**lhl Share capital**

Ordinary shares are classified as equity, as are preference shares if the holder does not have a put option and if any dividends or
redemption date can be deferred indefinitely. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are
shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.

**Iii Revenue**

Revenue is measured based on the consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled in a contract with a customer (net of
refunds) and excludes amounts collected on behalf of third parties. The Group recognises revenue when it transfers control of a
service to a customer.

_Commission and fees_
Revenue includes commission and fees receivable by the Group. Commission and fees relate mainly to placement or underwriting
of policies on behalf of insurers or policyholders and are recognised at the later of policy inception date and when the policy
placement has been completed and confirmed.

The Group charges fees and retains a portion of the policy premiums as commission. Premiums are typically collected on an
annual basis, at or near contract inception (which could be up to 60 days from contract inception). In some cases, customers are
offered the option to pay in instalments or are directed to a third-party premium credit provider for which the Group is entitled
to additional consideration that is recognised at policy inception. Some of the policies are rolling until the customer cancels the
policy.

###### FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**3** **Accounting policies (continued)**

_Post-placement performance obligations_
The Group may also have post-placement obligations in contracts with customers, which mainly consist of claims services
associated with the claims life cycle, e.g. first notification, claims investigation, decision and settlement, supply chain
management, fraud investigation, field/loss adjusting services and management information, but which may also include other
performance obligations such as the provision of mid-term adjustments.

To the extent that commission and fees received (or receivable) relate to both placement and post-placement performance
obligations, a suitable proportion of income related to post-placement obligations is deferred based on the estimated standalone
selling prices of the performance obligations in the contract and is presented as a contract liability. Revenue for post-placement
obligations is recognised over the period of providing the services.

_Variable consideration_
The Group is a party to the following material arrangements where the consideration receivable by the Group is variable:

  - _Trading deals -_ _profit share arrangements and loss corridor arrangements:_
Trading deals are arrangements with insurers which include incentives and penalties based on the performance of the
book of business. Revenue related to these arrangements is recognised on a best estimate basis, only to the extent that
it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognised will not occur (a
constraint).

Under some of these arrangements (e.g. profit share arrangements), an additional commission is earned from the insurer
based on the profit from the underlying book of business or the volume of policies placed. The estimated additional
commission is recognised as a contract asset and is reclassified to trade and other receivables when the underlying results
are determined. Some of the additional commissions may be provided in advance, in which case they can be subject to a
clawback. Advanced commission is recognised as a contract liability until the Group satisfies the underlying performance
obligations.

Under loss corridor arrangements, the commission received by the Group is subject to a clawback if a set loss ratio
exceeds an agreed threshold. When the threshold is exceeded, a payment calculated as a percentage of the loss (between
1% and 4% of the loss) is due to the insurer up to a maximum. Expected clawbacks under loss corridor arrangements are
recognised in trade and other payables.

Payment terms of the above arrangements vary across the Group and depend on the specific agreement with the insurer.
Because of the time required for policies to earn out and for claims to mature, final settlement of profit share and loss
corridor arrangements may take up to 2-3 years from the point at which the Group places a policy (i.e. satisfies its
performance obligation).

  - _Cancellation rights:_
Some contracts with customers include cancellation rights, whereby the consideration receivable by the Group is subject
to a clawback. If no claims are made under the policy, then cancellations usually entitle the policyholder to a proportional
refund of the consideration. When the effect is material, the Group adjusts the estimated consideration for the expected
clawback based on historical experience of average cancellations and recognises revenue only on the amount that is not
expected to be refunded. The Group reassesses at the end of the reporting period whether the estimated claw back needs
to be revisited. Amounts that are expected to be refunded for consideration that has been received or invoiced are
recognised in trade and other payables.

  - _Rolling contracts:_
Some policies placed by the Group are rolling until the customer cancels the policy. Revenue recognised on rolling
contracts (based on the expected consideration net of cancellations) is presented in contract assets until the
consideration is invoiced (except where acquired as part of a business combination, in which case it is presented in trade
and other receivables as a financial asset measured at fair value).


-----

###### FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**3** **Accounting policies (continued)**

_Other income_
Other income includes;

   - Fair value gains and losses on financial assets at FVTPL that are recognised on a business combination in relation to the
Group's right to variable consideration on rolling contracts with customers for which the performance obligation was
satisfied prior to the acquisition.

   - Rent receivable and service charges receivable in respect of sub-let properties.

   - Profit on termination of leases.

**(jl Contract costs**

Contract costs give rise to assets recognised in accordance with IFRS 15 which consist of:

  - Costs to fulfil - salary and other costs of customer-facing employees who undertake activities necessary to satisfy
anticipated contracts with the customer. The Group estimates the proportion of costs that are eligible to be capitalised
based on the time spent by customer-facing employees on relevant inception/renewal activities. Capitalised costs are
released to profit or loss on inception or renewal of the contract with the customer, which normally takes place within
one to three months of the reporting period.

  - Costs to obtain - incremental fees paid to distributors (usually aggregator websites) for obtaining new business. These
costs are amortised, on a systematic basis that is consistent with the transfer to the customer of the goods cir services to
which the asset relates, over the average life of the relationship with the customer.

The Group utilises the practical expedient to recognise the incremental costs of obtaining a contract as an expense when incurred
if the amortisation period of the asset that the entity otherwise would have recognised is one year or less.

Contract costs are presented within 'other assets' when recognised in the statement of financial position.

**(kl Operating segments**

Under IFRS 8 'Operating Segments', the Group determines and presents operating segments based on the information that is
reviewed by the Group Executive Committee, which is the Group's chief operating decision maker. The operating segments
reflect the Group's operational structure. Segments are reviewed and revised as necessary following structural changes within
the Group or acquisitions of new companies.

**(I) Employee benefits**

_Pension costs_
The Group operates a number of defined contribution pension schemes. A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under
which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity.

The Group has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions.

The costs of the Group's defined contribution pension schemes are charged to the income statement in the period in which they
fall due.


-----

###### FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**3** **Accounting policies (continued)**

_Long-Term Incentive Plans_
The Group operates a number of Long-Term Incentive Plans (LTIPs), under which the Group receives services from employees as
consideration for cash settled incentives which vest over a number of years based on achievement against certain performance
measures and/or service conditions. The incentives are earned by participants in the relevant performance and/or service period
(the performance period) and they must remain in employment in order to be entitled to payment.

The Group recognises an expense in respect of LTIPs over the vesting period, which is deemed to commence when the Group
makes participants aware of their right to participate in the LTIP and ends on conclusion of the performance period.

Where an L TIP is payable in instalments the Group recognises an expense based on either (i) the staged vesting approach, or (ii)
the plan's benefit formula, depending on the specific facts and circumstances of the relevant award. Where benefits are
materially higher in later years the expense is recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.

At the end of each reporting period the Group revises its estimate of the expected pay-out, and it recognises the impact of the
revision to the original estimate, if any, in the income statement with a corresponding adjustment to the related accrual or
prepayment (there can be a prepayment if an interim payment has been made subject to a clawback period) as relevant.

_Defined benefit pension arrangements_
The Group has some defined benefit arrangements as a result of an acquisition made in 2021. The cost of providing benefits for
these schemes is determined using the projected unit credit method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at the end of
each annual reporting period.

Remeasurements comprising actuarial gains and losses, and the return on plan assets (excluding interest income), including the
tax thereon, are recognised immediately in the statement of financial position with a charge or credit to other comprehensive
income in the period in which they occur. Remeasurements recognised in other comprehensive income are not reclassified.
Current service costs are recognised in profit or loss within salaries and associated expenses, as are any past service costs such
as those arising from curtailments or settlements. Gains or losses on settlement of a defined benefit plan are recognised when
the settlement occurs. Interest is calculated by applying a discount rate to the net defined benefit liability or asset and is
recognised within finance costs (note 8). Defined benefit costs are split into three categories:

  - Service costs, which includes current service cost and past service cost; and

  - Interest on the pension obligation; and

  - Remeasurement of net pension obligation, which includes:

     - The impact on the liabilities of changes in financial assumptions, which are based on market conditions at the
reporting date, and demographic assumptions, such as life expectancy, compared with those adopted at the start of
the year; and

     - The impact on the liabilities of actual experience being different to assumptions made at the start of the year; and

     - The return on plan assets above or below the interest income on those plan assets.

The net pension obligation (or pension surplus) recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position represents the
deficit (or surplus) in a defined benefit plan. Any surplus is limited to the present value of any economic benefits available in the
form of refunds from the plans or reductions in future contributions to the plans.

###### FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**3** **Accounting policies (continued}**

_Share-based payments_
The Group operates equity-settled and cash-settled share-based payment schemes. For equity-settled share-based payment
schemes, the fair value of the services received in exchange for the grant of the shares is recognised as an expense, measured
based on the grant date fair value of the shares and recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, which generally
depends on service and performance conditions being met. For cash-settled share-based payment schemes, the Group
recognises an expense and a corresponding liability over the vesting period based on the fair value of the shares at the reporting
date.

The shares issued under the schemes generally have no dividend or voting rights and cannot be sold. The shares of an equity­
settled share-based payment scheme are normally convertible to ordinary shares of the Group on the occurrence of a
crystallisation event, being the earlier of a liquidity event, an Initial Public Offering (IPO) and a winding-up. The Group has the
option to repurchase the shares if an employee leaves the Group prior to the occurrence of a crystallisation event.

**{ml Foreign currencies**

The Group's consolidated financial statements are presented in GBP, the Group's presentation currency.

_Foreign currency transactions and balances_
Foreign currency transactions are converted into the functional currency of the respective Group entity, using the exchange rate
at the date of the transaction.

Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are converted into GBP using the exchange rate at the reporting
date, with differences recognised in profit or loss.

Non-monetary items are not retranslated at the reporting date and are measured at the historical rate (translated using the
exchange rates at the transaction date), except for non-monetary items measured at fair value which are translated using the
exchange rates at the date when fair value was determined.

Profits or losses arising from derivatives taken out to hedge foreign currency exposure are recognised in the income statement
unless such contracts are designated as cash flow hedges, in which case they are accounted for as described above in (f) Cash
flow hedges.

_Foreign operations_
On consolidation, the results and financial position of foreign subsidiaries and branches are translated into the presentation
currency of the Group from their functional currencies, i.e. the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity
operates. Assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries and branches are translated into GBP at the exchange rate at the reporting
date. Income and expenses are translated into GBP at average exchange rates. The impact of these currency translations is
recorded in other comprehensive income and recognised in the foreign currency translation reserve in equity.

**(nl Taxation**

_Current tax_
Current tax is recognised for the amount of tax payable in respect of the taxable profit for the current or past reporting periods
using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.

_Deferred tax_
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of taxable temporary differences at the reporting date (except in relation to goodwill or a
transaction which is not a business combination and does not affect profit nor taxable profit). Deferred tax assets are only
recognised to the extent that it is probable they will be recovered against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or against future
taxable profits. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are only offset if there is a legally enforceable right to set off
current tax assets against current tax liabilities, and if they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on the
same taxable entity or on different taxable entities which intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or to
realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.

The tax expense for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in profit or loss, except that a change
attributable to an item of income or expense recognised as other comprehensive income is ·also recognised directly in other
comprehensive income. Similarly, income tax is recognised directly to equity if it relates to items that are recognised directly to
equity.

**fol Dividend distribution**

Dividends proposed or declared after the statement of financial position date are not recognised as a liability at the reporting

- date. Final dividends are recognised as a charge to equity once approved, and interim dividends are recognised once paid.

**Ip} Discontinued operations**

A disposal group qualifies as a discontinued operation if it is a component of an entity (which will have been a cash-generating
unit or group of cash-generating units) that either has been disposed of, or it is classified as held for sale, and:

   - it represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations; or

   - it is part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations;
or

   - it is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale.

Discontinued operations, if there are any, are excluded from the results of continuing operations and are presented as a single
amount in 'total comprehensive profit or loss for the period attributable to discontinued operations' in the income statement.

**lg) Held for sale**

Non-current assets, or disposal groups comprising assets and liabilities, are classified as held for sale if it is highly probable that
they will be recovered primarily through sale rather than through continuing use.

Such assets, or disposal groups, are generally measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Any
impairment loss on a disposal group is allocated first to goodwill, and then to the remaining assets and liabilities on a pro rata
basis, except that no loss is allocated to financial assets, deferred tax assets or employee benefit assets, which continu.e to be
measured in accordance with the Group's other accounting policies. Impairment losses on initial classification as held for sale and
subsequent gains and losses on remeasurement are recognised in profit or loss.

Once classified as held for sale, intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and right-of-use assets are no longer amortised
or depreciated, and any equity-accounted investee is no longer equity accounted.

**Ir) Application of new and revised International Financial Reporting Standards IIFRS)**

The Group adopted the 'Amendments to IFRS 9, and IFRS 7 Interest Rate Benchmark Reform' issued in September 2019 and
effective from 1 January 2020. The amendments provide temporary relief from some of the conditions for applying hedge
accounting requirements to hedging relationships directly affected by IBOR reform.

The reliefs have the effect that IBOR reform should not generally cause hedge accounting to terminate. However, any hedge
ineffectiveness is to be recorded in the income statement. The amendments set out triggers for when the reliefs will end, which
include the uncertainty arising from interest rate benchmark reform no longer being present.

The Group also adopted the 'Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16 - Interest Rate Benchmark Reform-Phase
2, issued in August 2020 and effective from 1 January 2021'. The phase 2 amendments address issues arising during interest rate
benchmark reform, including specifying when the 'phase 1' amendments will cease to apply, when hedge designations and
documentation should be updated, and when hedges of the alternative benchmark rate as the hedged risk are permitted.

The impact on the Group's financial statements of other amendments to accounting standards that have become effective in the
year beginning 1 January 2021 is not material.

**Other standards, amendments to standards and interpretations**
Several amendments to standards are mandatorily effective for annual periods beginning on 1 January 2021. None of these had
a material effect on the Group's financial statements.

There are no standards, amendments to standards or interpretations which are not yet effective and that are expected to
materially impact the Group's financial statements.

The Company issued 350,000 E preference shares ('E shares') of nominal value £0.01 each to a shareholder on 3 September, for
a subscription amount of £343.0m. The E shares accumulate dividends semi-annually in arrears on 30 June and 31 December,
which are deferred and not declared unless the Company, the issuer, elects to pay them in cash. The dividends accumulate based
on a 360-day year at a rate of 12.5% per annum, or at a rate of 11.5% per annum for the relevant accumulation period if the
Company elects to declare and pay the dividend rather than to defer and thus not declare nor pay it. The E shares have no
maturity date, but they are redeemable at any time at the option of the Company. The E shares are classified as equity as there
is no contractual obligation to pay a dividend or interest, there is no contractual obligation to redeem them, and the holder of
the E shares does not have a put option over them. The declaration and payment of dividends and the redemption of the E shares
are all at the option of the Company.

**Key sources of estimation uncertainty**

**Deferred tax assets**
Significant estimation is required in determining the asset recognised in respect of deferred tax. A deferred tax asset is recognised
for temporary timing differences, but management's best estimate is used to determine the extent to which it is probable that
taxable profits will be available in the future. against which the temporary differences can be utilised and to determine the
amount of this taxable profit. Deferred tax assets are measured at the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively
enacted by the end of the reporting period.

The deferred tax asset as at 31 December 2021 is £95.3m (2020: £60.6m).

**Revenue recognition - variable consideration**
The Group is a party to trading deals, such as profit sharing and loss corridor arrangements. These arrangements adjust the
consideration that the Group is entitled to for satisfying its performance obligations, and the amount and timing of revenue
subject to these arrangements is inherently uncertain.

The Group applies judgement in estimating the related variable consideration, which is measured on a best estimate basis using
either the 'expected value' method or the 'most likely amount' method, and which is recognised to the extent that a significant
reversal will not occur (a constraint).

In making the estimate, the Group uses historical, current and forecast information that is reasonably available to it. A higher
constraint (in some cases, full constraint) is applied when the results underlying these arrangements are highly susceptible to
factors outside the Group's influence or when the Group's experience has limited predictive value.

Estimates of the variable consideration are assessed at the end of each reporting period to determine whether they need to be
revised. The underwriting results are reviewed by the Group and the insurer on a regular basis, and information provided by the
insurer is used to refine the estimated amount of consideration. As the underwriting results become more certain, the constraint
is relaxed.

As at 31 December 2021, a loss corridor liability of £4.2m (2020: £5.0m) is included within trade and other payables and a variable
profit commission of £18.Sm (2020: £6.Bm) is included within contract assets.

Fair value gains and losses on financial assets at FVTPL are recognised on a business combination in relation to the Group's right
to variable consideration on rolling contracts with customers for which the performance obligation was satisfied prior to the
acquisition. The fair value of the Swinton rolling contract (a closed book of business) is a level 3 valuation, in accordance with
IFRS 13 'Fair Value Measurement', the key assumptions of which are (a) the product lifetime restrictions of 12, 24 and 36 months
for the Home Emergency Cover, Swinton Breakdown Insurance, and Personal Accident products, (b) the discount rate, which is
based on the Ardonagh weighted average cost of capital (WACC), and (c) the lapse rate curves, which are estimated based on
historical experience. A one-year increase in the product lifetime restrictions across all three products would give rise to a £0.2m
increase in other income in 2021. A 1% increase in the discount rate would give rise to a £5.9m decrease in other income in 2021.
The financial asset corresponding to the Swinton rolling contract is £26.0m as at 31 December 2021 (2020: £24.Bm).

**Impairment of assets**

The Group tests annually whether goodwill and other assets that have indefinite useful lives have suffered any impairment. Other
assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset
may exceed its recoverable amount. The last annual impairment test was performed as at 1 October 2021.

An impairment test of an asset or cash-generating unit (or group of cash-generating units) is performed by comparing its carrying
amount with its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value in
use, where its value in use is the present value of its future cash flows. An impairment test requires the application of significant
judgement because it relies on key assumptions, including forecast cash flows, a discount rate, a terminal growth rate and an
Adjusted EBITDA multiple.

Goodwill arising from a new business combination is, for the purposes of impairment testing, allocated to those cash-generating
units that are expected to benefit from the goodwill that was acquired. Impairment testing is performed at the level of the
smallest groups of cash-generating units at which goodwill is monitored, known as the "divisions".

Forecast cash flows used in the value in use calculation were determined by considering historic business performance, by
overlaying it with assumptions to reflect areas where growth or income improvement was expected, and by taking into account
the expected results of cost management programmes to which the Group was committed. These forecasts were extrapolated
to subsequent years using a steady growth rate being the CPI inflation rate of 1.9% (2020: 1.7%), and a terminal value was
calculated using the perpetual growth model. The discount rate of 9.67% (2020: 9.84%) that was applied to the forecasts was a
market participant weighted average cost of capital calculated by reference to the Capital Asset Pricing Model.

The fair value of the Group was calculated based on multiples of forecast 2021 Adjusted EBITDA and on information provided by
external advisors, where that information is based on recent transactions in the insurance broking industry. The fair value of a
division was estimated by apportioning the fair value of the Group between the divisions based on the value in use of each
division. The estimated costs of disposal are assumed, based on market experience, to be 1.5% of the fair value of the division.

**5** **Segmental analysis**

Descriptions of the Group's operating segments can be found in Section 1- Our businesses.

Under IFRS 8 'Operating Segments', the Group determines and presents operating segments based on the information that is
provided to the Group Executive Committee, which is the Group's chief operating decision maker.

Segments are reviewed and revised as necessary following structural changes within the Group or acquisitions of new companies.

The Group Executive Committee assesses the performance of the operating segments based on an Adjusted EB.ITDA measure.
The presentation of the segment information reflects that. The Group Executive Committee assesses the financial position of the
Group on a consolidated Group basis and therefore does not regularly receive measures of total assets or total liabilities on an
operating segment basis. Accordingly, no financial position measures are reported within the Group's segmental analysis.

The results include items directly attributable to an operating segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable
basis.

Commission and fees represent the ·Group's revenue from contracts with customers, which is recognised in accordance with IFRS
15. The Group's operating segments reflect its disaggregation of revenue.

**8** **Finance income and finance costs (continued)**

During the year, the coupon interest expense on the Group's debt totalled £211.6m (31 December 2020: £135. 7m). A further
£19.lm, (31 December 2020: £10.lm) of interest expense was recognised during the year relating to the unwind of the
discount on these instruments as part of accounting for them at ·amortised cost using the effective interest rate.

There was an amendment to the terms of the term facilities due 2026 debt arrangements on 19 August 2021, reducing the
margin on the term facilities due 2026 by 0.25% to the nominal interest rates set out in note 29 and removing the PIK option
from these facilities. This was accounted for as a modification as the cash flows of the amended debt compared to the
remaining cash flows of the original debt were, when both were discounted using the original effective interest rate, less
than 10% different, such that it was concluded that the amendment did not constitute a substantial change to the debt
arrangements. A £20.7m modification gain has been recognised in the income statement, within finance costs, and the
carrying amount of the debt has been adjusted accordingly.

On 18 November 2021, the margins on the term facility due 2026 were further reduced by 0.50% due to change to the
consolidated senior net leverage ratio. This reduction is not a change in market interest rates (it is specific to the Group) and
thus has been accounted for by adjusting the carrying amount of the debt to reflect the revised estimated cash flows using
the original effective interest rate. A £23.4m gain has been recognised in the income statement, within finance costs.

**Disposals**

On 17 June 2020 the Group disposed of its controlling interest in its subsidiary Solis Re Agency Inc (Solis Re), which forms
part of the Ardonagh Specialty operating segment, reducing its stake from 50.1% to 35.0%. Post disposal the Group holds
significant influence over Solis Re and accounts for its investment under the equity method of accounting. As part of the
disposal, the Group also exchanged its loans to Solis Re for redeemable preference shares that do not hold any voting rights.
The retained investments were recognised at fair value on the date of partial disposal.

On 1 November 2020, the Group sold its Milburn Insurance Brokers business and assets, which was part of the Ardonagh
Advisory segment. The consideration received was cash of £0.lm, deferred consideration of £0.3m and contingent
consideration with a fair value of £1.8m.

lnterdivision reclassifications arise from the reclassification of goodwill (and results) across divisions. 'Foreign exchange' arises
from the retranslation, using the exchange rate at the reporting date, of goodwill that resulted from the acquisition of a
foreign operation.

Goodwill is tested for impairment annually, and whenever there is an indication that it may be impaired. The annual
impairment test is performed as at 1 October each year. An impairment, if any, that results from that annual impairment test
would be reflected in the 31 December financial statements.

Goodwill is, for the purposes of impairment testing, allocated to CGUs or groups of CGUs expected to benefit from the
business combination associated with that goodwill, where a CGU is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generate
independent cash inflows. Management reviewed business performance, as at 1 October 2021 (and 1 October 2020), based
on the CGUs or groups of CGUs that are divisions. The divisions represented the lowest level within the Group at which
goodwill was monitored for internal management purposes, so the annual impairment test was performed by reference to
the divisions.


-----

###### FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**13** **Intangible assets (continued)**

An impairment test of goodwill is performed by comparing the carrying amount of each division (i.e. CGU or group of CG Us),
including the goodwill, with the recoverable amount of the division. The recoverable amount of a division is the higher of its
fair value less costs of disposal ('FVLCD') and its value in use ('VIU'), where the VIU of the division is the present value of its
future cash flows. If the recoverable amount of a division is lower than its carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised.

The impairment test of the divisions as at 1 October 2021 (and 1 October 2020) did not result in an impairment charge to
goodwill. The key data is summarised in the following tables:

###### FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**13** **Intangible assets (continued)**

Further information is provided below about the amounts in the above tables:

   - **_Goodwill:_**
The 'lnterdivision reclassifications' column in table 1 reflects the impact on goodwill of the reclassification of certain
businesses between divisions during the 12 month period presented.

The 'Foreign exchange' column in table 1 reflects the retranslation, using the exchange rate at the reporting date, of
goodwill that resulted from the acquisition of a foreign operation.

The 'Acquisitions and disposals' column in table_ 1 reflects the impact on goodwill of the acquisitions by the Group
during the 12 month period to 1 October 2021:
The share capital of Marmalade Limited, the goodwill of which is included in the Retail division;
The share capital of Headley Holdings Limited, of Hera Indemnity Limited, of Drayton Ins. Limited and of Usay
Group Limited, the goodwill of which is included in the Advisory division;
The share capital of Brian J Pierce Limited, the goodwill of which is included in the Europe division;
The share capital of Resilium Bidco Pty Limited and of AccuRisk Solutions LLC, and a business and certain
assets of Helmsley Wynne Furlonge LLP, the goodwill of which is included in the Global Partners division;
The share capital of Sino Insurance Brokers Limited, the goodwill of which is included in the Specialty division;
The goodwill of various other individually immaterial businesses.

(2020: The 'Acquisitions and disposals' column in table 1 reflects the impact on goodwill of the acquisitions by the
Group during the 12 month period to 1 October 2020 of a business and certain assets of Rural Insurance, the goodwill
of which is included in the MGA division, of the share capital of Nevada 4 Midco 1 Limited, the goodwill of which is
included in the Insurance Broking division, of the share capital of Nevada 5 Topco Limited, the goodwill of which is
included in the Arachas division, of the share capital of Nevada 4 Midco 1 Limited, the parent of Bravo Investment
Holdings Limited, the goodwill of which is included in the Insurance Broking division, of the share capital of Thames
Underwriting Limited, the goodwill of which is included in the MGA division, of the share capital of Lloyd Latchford
Group Limited, the goodwill of which is included in the Retail division, and of various other individually immaterial
businesses.)

The term 'Adjusted' has been used to describe goodwill as at 1 October 2020 in table 1 because it reflects the disposal
by the Group of Milburn Insurance Brokers even though that disposal occurred after 1 October 2020. This was to
ensure that the goodwill and thus the carrying amount as at 1 October 2020 was determined in a way that was
consistent with the recoverable amount as at 1 October 2020, which was based on forecasts that reflected that
disposal as if it had already occurred.

###### FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**13** **Intangible assets (continued)**

  - _Carrying amount:_
The 'Carrying amount' column in table 3 includes the carrying amounts of the divisions. These amounts are
determined by adding back external debt and lease liabilities to the net assets of each division and the Corporate
non-operating division, by allocating the resulting adjusted net assets of the Corporate non-operating division across
the divisions pro rata to the resulting adjusted net assets of each division, and by adding these amounts to the
goodwill of the divisions after first grossing that goodwill up for the non-controlling interest.

  - _Value in use:_
The 'VIU' column in table 2 includes the present value of future cash flows of the divisions together with an allocation
of the cash flows of the Corporate non-operating division, where the cash flows are based on the most recent five­
year forecast for Adjusted EBITDA as approved by management, pro forma for completed transactions as at 1
October 2021 (2020: 1 October 2020). These forecasts were determined by considering historic business
performance, by overlaying it with assumptions to reflect areas where growth or income improvement is expected,
and by taking into account the expected results of cost management programmes to which the Group is committed.
The 2026 forecast (2020: 2025 forecast) is extrapolated to subsequent years using a steady growth rate being the
CPI inflation rate of 1.9% per annum (2020: CPI inflation rate of 1.7% per annum), and a terminal value is calculated
using the perpetual growth model. The discount rate of 9.67% (2020: 9.84%) that has been applied to the forecasts
is a market participant weighted average cost of capital calculated by reference to the Capital Asset Pricing Model.

  - _Fair value less costs of disposal:_
The 'FVLCD' column in table 2 is determined by reference to the fair value of the Group, which is calculated based
on multiples of forecast 2022 (2020: forecast 2021) Adjusted EBITDA and on information provided by external
advisors. The fair value of a CGU is estimated using a valuation technique that makes use of level 3 inputs, in
accordance with IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement, specifically by apportioning the fair value of the Group between
the divisions based on the VIU of each division. The estimated costs of disposal, which are assumed based on market
experience to be 1.5% (2020: 1.5%) of the fair value of the division, are then deducted to determine the FVLCD of
the division.

  - _Recoverable amount:_
The 'Recoverable amount' column in tables 2 and 3 is equal to the VIU for all divisions, as VIU is greater than FVLCD
in all cases.

The key assumption to which the VIU and thus the recoverable amount is most sensitive is the five-year forecast for Adjusted
EBITDA. If the five-year forecast for Adjusted EBITDA were to be decreased by 29.06% (2020: 41.91%), there would be an
impairment to the MGA division. If the five-year forecast for Adjusted EBITDA were to be decreased by 30.69% (2020:
20.16%) there would also be an impairment to the Europe division. If the five-year forecast for Adjusted EBITDA were to be
decreased by 61.47% (2020: 40.42%), there would also be an impairment to the Advisory division. No further reasonably
possible change in this assumption alone would result in an impairment to any other CGU.

###### FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**15** **Leases**

The majority of the Group's leases are for properties in the UK and these leases typically run for a period of 5-10 years. Some
of the Group's leases are being held over beyond the original end date of the lease. Rent is normally fixed but may be subject
to a review every few years. Many of the Group's long-term contracts have an option to terminate the lease prior to its end
date, but in most cases termination options are not reasonably certain to be exercised so that the lease liability reflects all
lease payments through to the ultimate end date of the lease. Service charges and other contractual payments to the lessor
are excluded from the measurement of the lease liability. VAT (including when it is irrecoverable) and business rates are also
excluded from the measurement of the lease liability as they do not constitute a lease payment under IFRS 16.

The Group does not act as a lessor other than as a sublessor. Subleases are not considered material for the Group.

leases of low value assets, for which the Group applies the practical expedient not to recognise a lease liability, are not
considered material for the Group.

The table below provides a schedule of the movements in the carrying amount of the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities
(when the Group acts as a lessee) that are held on the statement of financial position during the year ended 31 December
2021.

###### FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**16** **Business combinations (continued)**

The above table reflects the impact of measurement period adjustments made in 2021, relating to acquisitions completed in
2020. The significant measurement period adjustments are listed below:

  - Acquisition of Nevada 5 Topco Limited (Arachas) - A measurement period adjustment was recorded on 31 March 2021
to allocate the intangibles recognised on acquisition and an adjustment to off-market leases resulting in a decrease to
goodwill of £(1.2)m and an increase to customer relationships of £0.4m.

  - Acquisition of Nevada 4 Midco 1 Limited (Bravo) - A measurement period adjustment was recorded on 7 July 2021 to
allocate the intangibles recognised on acquisition. Customer relationships increased by £36.Sm, brand by £2.0m,
intellectual property by £1.Bm and deferred tax decreased by £(7.6)m. As a result, Goodwill decreased by £(32.6)m.

  - Acquisition of Robus Group Limited - A measurement period adjustment was recorded on 30 June 2021 to allocate the
intangibles recognised on acquisition. Customer relationships decreased by £(0.9)m, brand by £(0.l)m and deferred tax
increased by £0.2m. As a result, goodwill increased by £(0.4)m. There was also an adjustment booked to the acquisition
accounting resulting in a reduction to the price of the acquisition of £(0.4)m.

  - Acquisition of Lloyd Latchford - A measurement period adjustment was recorded on 30 April 2021 to reclassify the
intangible recognised on acquisition. Customer relationships decreased by £(1.3)m, brand by £(0.l)m, computer software
increased by £0.Sm and deferred tax by £0.lm. As a result, goodwill increased by £0.9m.

The acquisitions were accounted for under IFRS 3 'Business Combinations', which requires that the identifiable assets acquired,
and the liabilities assumed are measured at their acquisition date fair value. Goodwill is calculated as the difference between (a)
the acquisition consideration plus the amount of any non-controlling interest, and (b) the acquisition date fair value of the net
assets/(liabilities) acquired.

The amounts recognised in the year end consolidated financial statements are provisional and adjustments may occur during the
remainder of the measurement period.

**Associates**

On 12 September 2019, the Group acquired a 40% interest in Sino Insurance Brokers Limited (which has a wholly owned subsidiary,
Sino Reinsurance Brokers Limited), comprising 400,000 ordinary shares of HKDl each. This associate is initially recognised at cost
and subsequently via the equity method, where the cost is the consideration comprising cash of HKD14.3m and contingent
consideration with a fair value of HKD21.4m. The Group was entitled, under the terms of the acquisition of the 40% interest, to
exercise a call option during the period 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2023 to acquire a further 35% interest in Sino Insurance
Brokers Limited, comprising 350,000 ordinary shares of HKDl each.

On 1 January 2021, the Group obtained control over Sino Insurance Brokers Limited as a result of the call option becoming currently
exercisable (albeit not exercised) on and from that date. The call option, if exercised, enables the Group to increase its 40% holding
in Sino Insurance Brokers Limited to 75%. Sino Insurance Brokers Limited and its subsidiaries had previously been accounted for as
an associate, but they are consolidated from 1 January 2021 as a result of the Group obtaining control. The consideration paid on
1 January 2021 was £nil. The equity interest was remeasured on 1 January 2021 (a business combination achieved in stages) from
its carrying amount of £4.lm to its fair value of £5.5m, giving rise to a £1.4m gain in the income statement, and it was then
derecognised. A non-controlling interest of £6.5m was recognised on 1 January 2021.

Sino Insurance Brokers Limited is incorporated in Hong Kong with a registered address of: Room 2501, Singga Commercial Centre,
144-151 Connaught Road West, Hong Kong.

On 23 December 2021, the Group acquired a 49% holding in the equity of the subsidiary of a service provider, for £nil consideration.
It was also agreed that the service provider would novate to this associate £3.0m of amounts that were due to and thus receivable
by the Group, so this amount is thereafter receivable by the associate and then by the Group from the associate, which is a related
party.

The remaining investment in associate is in Solis Re Agency Inc, a company incorporated in the USA with a registered office address
of: c/o Corporation Service Company, 2711 Centerville Road, Suite 400, Wilmington, DE 19808.

Contract assets are amounts of revenue recognised by the Group that are subject to variability. Variable consideration is a key
source of estimation uncertainty (note 4). The increase to the contract assets balance during the year ending 31 December 2021
reflects a £5.lm impact of new acquisitions offset by a decrease of £(0.8)m in profit commissions. The estimated revenue relating
to profit commission that was recognised in 2021 on policies incepted prior to 2021 amounts to £3.2m (2020: £6.4m related to
policies incepted prior to 2020). This is generally due to re-estimation of amounts previously recognised and relaxation of the
constraint on revenue as amounts become more certain.

Contract liabilities represent the Group's obligation to transfer services to customers for which the Group has received the
consideration (or the amount is due) from the customer. During the year ended 31 December 2021, the Group recognised revenue
amounting to £30.9m (2020: £26.Sm) that was included in the opening balance of contract liabilities. Contract liabilities increased
during the year ending 31 December 2021 mainly due 'to a £4.2m increase in Geo Underwriting Services Limited and £10.7m
following the acquisition of the Ed Broking and Besso companies.

The Group applies the practical expedient in IFRS 15 not to disclose information about the transaction price associated with
performance obligations to be completed after the reporting date, if the performance obligation is part of a contract that has an
original expected duration of one year or less. With respect to contracts with an original expected duration of more than a year,
the aggregate amount of transaction price allocated to performance obligations that are unsatisfied (or partially satisfied) as of the
reporting date is £22.7m (2020: £8.lm). This amount is expected to be recognised as revenue as follows:

The Group's cost to fulfil balance at each reporting period reflects salaries and other costs of customer-facing employees who
undertake activities necessary to satisfy anticipated contracts with the customer. This is subsequently released to the profit or loss
when the Group recognises the related revenue from those contracts, which is usually after the reporting date {1-3 months). The
net impact on profit or loss for the year ending 31 December 2021 was a decrease in staff costs of £0.4m (2020: £0.lm).

Costs to obtain include incremental fees paid to aggregator websites for obtaining new business and are amortised, on a systematic
basis that is consistent with the transfer to the customer of the goods or services to which the asset relates, over the average life
of the relationship with the customer.

Amortisation amounting to £18.lm was recognised in the profit or loss during the year ending 31 December 2021 (2020: £21.3m).

**Fair value measurement**
Financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value in the statement of financial position are grouped into three levels of
a fair value hierarchy. The three levels are defined based on the observability of significant inputs to the measurement, as follows:

  - Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;

  - Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly
as prices, or indirectly derived from prices; and

  - Level 3: unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.

The following table shows the levels within the hierarchy of financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on an ongoing
basis:

###### FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**25** **Financial instruments (continued)**

**Fair value measurement (continued}**

The following valuation techniques are used for instruments categorised in Levels 2 and 3:

**Derivative financial instruments (Level 2)**
The Group's derivatives are categorised within level 2 of the fai_r value hierarchy. These contracts are not traded in an active market,
but the fair value is determined using valuation techniques and available market data, such as forward exchange rates
corresponding to the maturity of the contract observable at the statement of financial position date and an appropriate sector
credit spread.

**UCIS recovered assets (Level 3)**

- he UCIS recovered assets are held at their fair value and are categorised within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Where no
professional valuation is available, they are recognised at their published net asset value with an appropriate adjustment applied
to the published unit price to reflect their illiquid nature and potentially lower net realisable value.

**Trade and other receivables/contingent consideration receivable (Level 3)**
Trade and other receivables include contingent consideration receivable with a fair value of £27.4m (2020: £2.3m) of which £26.9m
is arising from the acquisition of the insurance operations of BGC Partners Inc and is subject to final agreement of the purchase
price and £0.2m arising from the disposal of a renewal rights portfolio by AccuRisk Solutions LLC in 2019. This is categorised within
level 3 of the fair value hierarchy with the valuation based on management's best estimate of the probability of the successful
completion of the requirements set out in the sale and purchase agreements.

Also included in trade and other receivables at 31 December 2021 were assets at fair value through profit or loss that were
recognised on a business combination in relation to the Group's right to variable consideration on rolling contracts with customers
for which the performance obligation was satisfied prior to the acquisition. The fair value is a level 3 valuation and is calculated as
the present value of future cash flows where those cash flows take into account expected cancellation rates and the life of the
underlying insurance product.

**Convertible loan receivable (Level 3)**

The fair value of the convertible loan receivable is determined using a valuation technique (level 3 of the fair value hierarchy). In
particular, the fair value of the convertible loan receivable is calculated as the lower of (a) the fair value of the equity into which
the loan can be converted, and (b) the fair value of an equivalent loan that is not convertible. The fair value of the equity is
determined based on a multiple of forecast EBITDA and using information provided by external advisors.

**Contingent consideration, share buyout and deferred proceeds (Level 3)**

The 31 December 2021 contingent consideration includes amounts arising from the acquisitions in 2021 of Headley Holdings
Limited, Hera Indemnity Limited, Marmalade Limited, Drayton Ins. Limited, Usay Group Limited and the business and assets of
Tandem Medical Solutions, in 2020 of Nevada 4 Midco 1 Limited and Thames Underwriting Limited, and from the acquisition in
2019 of an associate interest (now a subsidiary - note 18) in Sino Insurance Brokers Limited, as well as from other acquisitions that
are individually not material. The 31 December 2021 share buyout liability arises from the acquisitions in 2021 of the business and
assets of Hemsley Wynne Furlonge LLP, in 2020 of Lloyd Latchford Group Limited and Nevada 4 Midco 1 Limited, as well as from
other acquisitions that are individually not material.

Share buyout is the liability arising from put options granted by the Group to minority shareholders of certain consolidated
subsidiaries, giving the holders the right to sell all of their interest in those subsidiaries to the Group. The fair value of the share
buyout payments is determined based on the discounted present value of the forecast option strike price, where the discount rate
is the Group WACC if the strike price is a multiple of forecast EBITDA, less net debt.

Contingent consideration payments are generally contingent on the post-acquisition performance of the acquired business and
achievement of certain performance thresholds. The fair value of contingent consideration is determined based on actual,md
forecast business performance of the acquired business, discounted using the Group WACC as the discount rate.

###### FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**25** **Financial instruments (continued)**

**Unlisted investments at fair value through other comprehensive income (Level 3}**
Unlisted investments are categorised within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The valuation technique applied, except where
specific market price information is available, is cost less any provision for impairment.

**Fair value of financial instruments measured at amortised cost**
The Directors consider the carrying amounts for trade and other receivables, trade and other payables, and the current portion of
financial liabilities that are not measured at fair value, to approximate their fair values. The fair value of the Group's borrowings is
disclosed in note 29.

**Reconciliation of recurring fair value measurements within level 3**

Gains and losses on the above instruments that are recognised in profit or loss are classified within other income and other
operating costs respectively.

As part of the UCIS redress process the Group was able to acquire, in some cases, illiquid assets held by claimants. These assets are
classified as fair value through profit or loss and the Group intends to realise their cash value as soon as it is feasible to do so. The
Group has designated all of its unlisted equity investments as FVTOCI because these investments were initially held as long-term
strategic investments that were not expected to be sold in the short to medium term. Dividends recognised in respect of the
unlisted equity investments in the period amounted to £nil (2020: £nil).

As at 31 December 2021, trade and other receivables include a £26.0m (2020: £24.8m) asset classified at FVTPL that was recognised
on a business combination in relation to the Group's right to variable consideration on rolling contracts with customers for which
the performance obligation was satisfied prior to the acquisition date.

###### FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**25** **Financial instruments (continued)**

**Financial instruments risk**

The Group is exposed to various risks in relation to financial instruments. The main types of risks are market risk, credit risk and
liquidity risk. As part of its overall governance and control arrangements, the Group operates a risk management framework (RMF)
designed to identify, assess, manage, monitor and report on these risks.

The Group does not actively engage in the trading of financial assets for speculative purposes. The most significant financial risks
to which the Group is exposed are described below.

**Market risk analysis**

The Group is exposed to market risk through its use of financial instruments and specifically to foreign currency risk and interest
rate risk.

**Foreign currency risk**

The Group's main exposure to foreign currency risk arises from: (i) its USD borrowings, and (ii) the settlement in foreign currency,
principally USD, of brokerage and fees relating to the placement of insurance business originating overseas. The Group uses
derivatives, specifically forward contracts and previously cross-currency swaps, to mitigate its foreign currency risk.

The Group's forward contracts, and previously its cross-currency swaps, mitigate its exposure to foreign currency risk on its USD
PIK toggle notes. The Group defers payment of interest on its USD PIK toggle notes, and the forward contracts hedge the eventual
repayment of the principal and accumulated interest.

The Group has forward contracts that mitigate its exposure to foreign currency risk on certain USD revenue arising on the
placement of premiums denominated in USD, which is not the presentation nor functional currency of the Group. Based on forecast
transactions, the Group effectively sells USD revenue by reference to individual brokerage transactions. The hedged USD revenues
currently exclude the USD revenues resulting from the acquisition on 1 November 2021 of Ed Broking Group Limited. These
revenues are used to make interest payments on the USD CAR facility, but it is expected that the residual cash flows will be hedged
in accordance with existing policy.

For further information on hedge accounting please refer to note 26.

**Interest rate risk**

The Group has USD 500.0m of PIK toggle notes, but that is at fixed interest rates and thus does not give rise to interest rate risk.
The Group's main exposure to interest rate risk arises from its £1,592.8m floating rate senior secured term loan, which has exposure
to EURIBOR and SONIA (previously GBP LIBOR) benchmark interest rates. The Group uses derivatives, specifically interest rate
swaps, to mitigate this interest rate risk.

The Group is also exposed to USD LIBOR on the USD 540.0m CAR facility and as of the reporting date has not entered into derivatives
to mitigate this interest rate exposure. The USD interest payments are currently being sourced from USD revenues from Ed Broking
Group Limited, which are not currently part of a documented hedge accounting relationship.

The Group is also exposed to changes in interest rates through its secured revolving credit facility borrowings at variable interest
rates. However, these borrowings were undrawn as at 31 December 2021.

###### FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**25** **Financial instruments (continued)**

**Credit risk analysis**

Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty fails to discharge an obligation to the Group. The Group is exposed to this risk as it has a
significant amount of trade receivables due from policyholders and from insurance companies with which it places insurance.
However, most of the credit risk with policyholders is mitigated by the Group's ability to cancel the underlying policies and recoup
a portion of the amount from insurers.

The Group's maximum exposure to credit risk is limited to the carrying amount of financial assets recognised at 31 December, as
summarised below:


31 December
2020
£000

585,637
273,799

**63,833**
**27,387**


**27,387** 2,071

**2,196,219** 875,652


Counterparty balances are monitored as part of the credit control process. Significant balances are actively managed through the
Group's ongoing strategic insurer relationship programme.

The Group had certain trade receivables as at 31 December 2021 that had not been settled by the contractual due date but that
were not considered to be impaired.

The credit risk for cash and cash equivalents, money market funds and derivative financial instruments is considered negligible as
the counterparties are reputable financial institutions with high quality external credit ratings. The Group does not hold any
collateral as security.

**Expected credit losses**

The estimated ECL for the current year is calculated based on actual credit loss experience over two years by segment. Actual credit
loss experience is, where appropriate, adjusted by scalar factors to reflect differences between economic conditions during the
period over which the historical data was collected, current conditions and the Group's view of economic conditions over the
expected lives of the receivables. The scalar factors are based on GDP and unemployment rate forecasts (source: HM Treasury
'Forecasts for the UK Economy') and include the following:

  - GDP: A 26.32% decrease in the growth in GDP is expected, from 7.13% in 2021 to 5.25% in 2022, which indicates that
historical credit loss experience should be increased (2020: a 147.89% increase in the growth in GDP was expected, from
(10.65)% in 2020 to 5.1% in 2021, which indicated that historical credit loss experience should be decreased); and

  - Unemployment rate: A 7.03% decrease in unemployment rates is expected, from 4.63% in 2021 to 4.3% in 2022, which
indicates that historical credit loss experience should be decreased (2020: a 12.61% increase in unemployment rates was
expected, from 5.95% in 2020 to 6.7% in 2021, which indicated that historical credit loss experience should be increased).

ECL is measured on the basis that the counterparties are a single group and the calculation is not further distinguished between
the Group's different customer types.

The following table shows the movement in lifetime ECL that has been recognised for trade receivables in accordance with the
simplified approach set out in.lFRS 9:

**FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**25** **Financial instruments (continued)**

**Liquidity risk analysis**

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group might be unable to meet its obligations.

The Group manages its liquidity needs by monitoring scheduled debt servicing payments for long-term financial liabilities as well as forecasting cash inflows and outflows due in day-to-day
business. The Group is cash generative and has an active cash management process. The Group Treasury function undertakes short term cash flow forecasting and closely monitors and manages
the Group's cash balances. Immediate liquidity is available from the revolving credit facility (RCF) should any short-term financing be required. Drawings permissible under the RCF are limited
by the Group's credit facility arrangements, which take into account the arrangements that are in place to address ETV liabilities. The RCF facility had not been utilised as at 31 December 2021.

The following are the remaining undiscounted contractual maturities (excluding interest payments) of non-derivative financial liabilities at the reporting date, except for lease liabilities (note
15). Information about derivative financial liabilities is given in note 25.

**26** **Hedge accounting**

See the principal risks and uncertainties section in the Strategic Report with respect to the Group's exposure to foreign currency
risk and interest rate risk, and how the Group mitigates those risks. Further details are provided below.

**Derivatives**

The Group has economic hedge relationships that mitigate foreign exchange risk arising from its USD borrowings and USD revenue.
The Group also has economic hedge relationships that mitigate interest rate risk arising from its floating rate senior secured term
loan that was entered into in July 2020. The Group applies hedge accounting for those hedge relationships that meet the hedge
accounting criteria detailed in note 3. The Group manages all other risks associated with these exposures, such as credit risk, but
it does not apply hedge accounting for those risks.

Derivatives are only used for hedging purposes. The Group has the following derivative financial instruments as at the end of the
period:


**Non-current assets**

See note 25 for information on fair values and the assumptions and methods used to measure fair value.

**Derivatives hedging borrowings**

The Group has USD forward contracts to hedge the foreign currency risk on USD 677.0m payments of principal and interest relating
to USD 500.0m PIK toggle notes due 2027 that were issued in July 2020.

The Group entered into interest rate swaps that were designated as hedging instruments against the floating rate senior secured
term loan (note 29). The interest rate swaps exchange a floating interest rate with a fixed interest rate and apply to interest incurred
from 14 January 2021.

**Derivatives hedging forecast revenue**

The Group enters into forward contracts to mitigate the exposure resulting from certain USD revenue arising on the placement of
premiums denominated in USD, which is not the presentation currency nor functional currency of the Group.

Based on forecast transactions, the Group effectively sells accumulated USD revenue by reference to individual brokerage
transactions. The Group's track record in receiving USD revenue from long established clients provides a high degree of confidence
that forecast transactions are highly probable for hedge accounting purposes.

The Group is exposed to interest rates, which are determined by reference to SONIA (previously LIBOR) and EURIBOR, to which it
applies hedge accounting. The Group applied the amendments to IFRS 9 which allowed the Group to continue hedge accounting
during the period of uncertainty arising from IBOR reforms. In assessing whether the hedge is expected to be highly effective on a
forward-looking basis, the Group therefore assumed that the cash flows of the interest rate swaps and the hedged debt
instruments are not altered by IBOR reform. The original LIBOR floating rate loan and original LIBOR interest rate swaps were
modified so that the loan and swaps will reference a SONIA interest rate on each future interest reset date, and thus the Group no
longer has exposure to LIBOR as at the reporting date. The Group has amended its hedge designations and documentation to
reflect these changes.

###### FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**26** **Hedge accounting (continued)**

At the reporting date the Group hedged its USO PIK toggle notes using forward contracts. Consequently, there is no net
exposure to currency risk on the USO PIK toggle notes.

The Group does not currently use derivative contracts to hedge the currency risk on its €180.0m privately placed term facility
or its USO S40.0m CAR facility, but there is a natural currency hedge with the Euro investments and with the USO investment
in Ed Broking Group Limited. The translation differences arising on the foreign denominated borrowings are recognised

- On 11 June 2021, the Group purchased 3,262,071 Atlanta A shares in Atlanta Investment Holdings 3 Limited from minority
shareholders, the consideration for which was 10,590,693 TAGL ordinary shares with a fair value of £22.3m and £16.0m of
loan notes (which included pre-funded interest of £0.Sm) redeemable over there years to 31 July 2023, such that the gross
carrying amount of the debt on issue date is £16.Sm.

Insurance creditors include an amount of £4.2m which provides for the estimated losses recoverable by the insurer for net
premiums earned to date on those schemes with loss corridor arrangements. The estimated adjustment to revenue relating
to the loss corridor that was recognised in 2020 on policies incepted prior to 2020 amounts to £1.3m reduction. This is due
to re-estimation of amounts previously recognised.

The Directors consider the carrying amount of trade payables approximates to their fair value.

**28** **Employee benefits**

**Long-term incentive plans**
The Group has a number of long-term incentive schemes. The amounts that will ultimately vest are dependent on
achievement against various performance measures (including Group EBITDA and individual contribution targets) and/or
service conditions. The incentives are paid to participants at the end of the relevant performance and/or service period.

**Defined contribution pension schemes**
Contributions by the Company into defined contribution schemes during the year were £17.Gm (2020: £13.9m).

**Defined benefit pension schemes**
On 1 November 2021, the Group purchased the Ed Broking Group, which operates two unfunded defined benefit schemes
in Germany (the 'German schemes') and one funded defined benefit scheme in the UK, the Cooper Gay (Holdings) Limited
Retirement Benefits Scheme (the 'UK scheme'). The projected unit credit actuarial cost method has been used in determining
the present value of the defined benefit obligation, the current service cost and, where applicable, past service cost.

Responsibility for governance of the UK plan, including investment decisions and contribution schedules, lies with trustees,
who are required to consult Ed Broking Holdings (London) Limited, which is the only employer company that participates in
the UK Scheme.

The Group cash contributions to the pension schemes are determined by reference to actuarial valuations undertaken by
the schemes' actuaries at intervals not exceeding three years, and not by the provisions of IAS 19. These funding valuations
can differ materially from the requirements of IAS 19. In particular the discount rate used to determine the value of liabilities
under IAS 19 is determined by reference to the yield on high grade corporate bonds of comparable duration to the liabilities.
In contrast, the discount rate used in the funding valuation is determined by reference to the yield on the schemes' current
and projected future investment portfolio. The UK scheme operates under the terms of funding proposals that are reviewed
by the relevant pension authority.

Full actuarial valuations were carried out as at December 2021 for the German Schemes and as at 31 December 2018 for
the UK Scheme. In general, actuarial valuations are not available for public inspection, but the results of valuations are
advised to the members of the scheme.

**Description of Funding Arrangements and Funding Policy That Affect Future Contributions**

All schemes are closed to new entrants.

The German Schemes are unfunded and as such no funding arrangements apply. One German scheme is closed whilst the
other is open to future accrual.

The UK defined benefit scheme is open to future accrual. Where a funding valuation reveals a deficit in a scheme, the Group
will generally agree a schedule of contributions with the Trustees designed to address the deficit over an agreed future time
horizon. The triennial actuarial valuation of the UK Scheme was last carried out as at 31 December 2018, and a recovery plan
of £1.92m per annum was agreed with the previous owners of the company, which runs to 31 July 2025. Pursuant to the sale
and purchase agreement between the Group and the sellers, the sellers will continue to contribute towards this actuarial
deficit until July 2025, or when the scheme is no longer in actuarial deficit. The Group has recognised a contingent
consideration receivable on the balance sheet for the payments due from the seller. Expected employer contributions for
the next financial year are £2. 7m.

###### FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**28** **Employee benefits (continued)**

**Employee benefit plan risks**
The employee benefit plans expose the Group to a number of risks, the most significant of which are:

**Asset volatility: The plan liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set by reference to corporate bond yields. If assets**
underperform this yield this will create a deficit. The plans hold equities and other growth assets which, though expected to
outperform corporate bonds in the long term, create volatility and risk in the short term. The allocation to growth assets is
monitored to ensure that it remains appropriate given the plans' long-term objectives.

**Discount rates: The discount rates employed in determining the present value of the schemes' liabilities are determined by**
reference to market yields at the balance sheet date on high-quality corporate bonds of a currency and term consistent with
the currency and term of the associated post-employment benefit obligations. Changes in discount rates impact the quantum
of the liabilities.

**Inflation risk: Some of the Group pension obligations have an inflation linkage; higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities**
(although in most cases, caps on the level of inflationary increases are in place to protect the plan against extreme inflation).
The rate of inflation is derived from the retail price index in the UK. The breakeven rate in the Eurozone is used for the basis
for the German inflation assumption.

**Longevity risk: In the majority of cases, the Group defined benefit schemes provide benefits for the life of the member, so**
increases in life expectancy will therefore give rise to higher liabilities.

The size of the obligation is sensitive to judgemental actuarial assumptions. These include demographic assumptions
covering mortality, economic assumptions covering price inflation and benefit increases, together with the discount rate.
The expected return on plan assets is also a key judgement.

The principal actuarial assumptions are as follows:


**UK schemes**
**31 December**
**2021**

**3.50%**
**1.95%**
**3.35%**
**2.90%**


**Key assumptions used**

Inflation rate (CPI)


**German schemes**
**31 December**
**2021**

**1.75%**
**0.85%**
**n/a**
**1.75%**


Assumptions regarding future mortality experience are set based on information from published statistics and experience in
all geographic regions, and they are selected to reflect the characteristics and experience of the membership of the relevant
plans. In relation to the UK, this has been done by adjusting standard mortality tables to reflect recent research into mortality
experience in the respective regions combined with an allowance for improvement factors·. The average life expectancy, in
years, of a pensioner retiring at 65 is as follows:

Rate of mortality Members assumed to live 1 year longer (543) (2,658) (3,201)
Rate of mortality Members assumed to live 1 year less 543 2,658 3,201

The above sensitivity analyses are based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant. The
sensitivity analysis intends to provide assistance in understanding the sensitivity of the valuation of pension liabilities to market
movements in discount rates, inflation rates and mortality assumptions for scheme beneficiaries.

The UK trustees invest the funds in a range of assets with the objective of maximising the fund return with a view to containing
the cost of funding the scheme whilst at the same time maintaining an acceptable risk profile. In assessing the risk profile, the
Trustees take account of the nature and duration of the liabilities. Approximately 52% of the UK funds are invested in liability
matching investments with the UK Scheme having hedged broadly 90% of its interest and inflation risk (when measured on a gilts
basis). The trustees review investment strategy regularly.

- The nominal interest rates stated are the margins (which for the term facilities due 2026 adjust based on leverage) and exclude payment in kind (PIK) premiums on the borrowings (that are enacted
at the request of the borrower) and exclude floating rate floors of 0.75% for the GBP and USD borrowings and 1.00% for the EUR borrowings applicable to the term facilities due 2026. At the previous
year end it was the intention of Management to enact the PIK option meaning the carrying amount of borrowings has taken this into account when calculating the effective interest rate, and in January
2021 the options were exercised.

There was an amendment to the terms of the term facilities due 2026 debt arrangements on 19 August 2021, reducing the margin on the term facilities due 2026 by 0.25% to the nominal interest rates
set out in the table above and removing the PIK option from these facilities. This was accounted for as a modification as the cash flows of the amended debt compared to the remaining cash flows of
the original debt were, when both were discounted using the original effective interest rate, less than 10% different, such that it was concluded that the amendment did not constitute a substantial
change to the debt arrangements. A £20. 7m modification gain has been recognised in the income statement, within finance costs, and the carrying amount of the debt has.been adjusted accordingly.

On 18 November 2021, the margins on the term facility due 2026 were further reduced by 0.50% due to change to the consolidated senior net leverage ratio. This reduction is not a change in market
interest rates (it is specific to the Group) and thus has been accounted for by adjusting the carrying amount of the debt to reflect the revised estimated cash flows using the original effective interest
rate. A £23.4m gain has been recognised in the income statement, within finance costs.

Interest is payable on the notes in January and July of each year.

The Group hedges its foreign currency exposure from the USD SOD.Om PIK toggle notes due 2027 as described in note 26.

###### FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**30** **Current tax and deferred tax (continued)**

Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that the realisation of the related tax benefit through future taxable profits is
probable based on the profit forecasts for the Group.

In the March 2021 Budget, it was announced that the UK Corporation Tax Rate will rise from its current rate of 19% to 25% with
effect from April 2023. UK deferred tax balances as at 31 December 2021 are measured at the rate that the respective assets and
liabilities will reverse.

The Group did not recognise deferred income tax assets (with no expiry date) in respect of deductible temporary differences as
follows:
**31 December** 31 December

###### FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**31** **Provisions (continued)**

**Enhanced Transfer Values (ETV) and run off costs provision**
As reported previously, certain subsidiaries within the Group have obligations to make redress payments in respect of past pension
transfer advice. The provision at 31 December 2021 is £1.6m. The redress programme is nearing conclusion.

**General provision for litigation matters (including E&O claims)**
In the normal course of business, the Group may receive claims in respect of alleged errors and omissions and other matters.
Provisions are made in respect of such litigation matters, representing the best estimate of the liability based on legal advice where
appropriate. The outcome of the currently pending and future proceedings, in relation to errors and omissions and other matters,
cannot be predicted with certainty. Thus, an adverse decision in a current or future lawsuit could result in additional costs that are
not covered, either wholly or partially, under insurance policies and that are in excess of the presently established provisions.

**Property provision**
_Onerous lease £1.lm_
This provision provides for costs incurred on vacant properties, excluding rent costs (which are subject to lease accounting).

_Dilopidotions £10.Bm_
This provision provides for the estimated amounts payable for dilapidations on each property at the end of the lease term.

**Future renewal scheme**
The provision for the future renewal scheme was recognised as part of the acquisition of Nevada Investment Holdings 2 Limited
in 2019. It represents the estimated costs to be paid to appointed representatives that meet certain eligibility criteria under a
contract termination scheme introduced by the acquiree and is based on the amount that would be receivable by each appointed
representative in respect of their portfolio if they remain active as an appointed representative.

Amounts are paid to appointed representatives over a period of four years from when the eligibility criteria under the scheme are
met and they cease to act as an appointed representative. The amount paid is dependent on factors such as the size of the portfolio
of the appointed representative and the rate of renewal commission on the underlying policies.

When the retirement of an appointed representative is agreed, the related liability is transferred to other creditors (within trade
and other payables).

**Branch closure**
This provision relates to the cost of closing branches by The Swinton Group, excluding rent costs (which are subject to lease
accounting).

**Other provision**
The other provision balance at 31 December 2021 includes a £1.lm restructuring provisions for onerous contracts.

**33** **Share-based payments**

**Equity-settled share-based payment schemes:**

The Group operated the 'Ardonagh MIP' and 'Atlanta MIP' in 2019 and through part of 2020, which were equity-settled share­
based payment arrangements. These were replaced in 2020 by B ordinary shares of The Ardonagh Group Limited (TAGL Ordinary
B shares), which are accounted for as an equity-settled share-based payment arrangement that modifies the existing arrangements
and results in no incremental fair value at the modification date. The new Ardonagh MIP, comprising the Tier 1 arrangements and
the Employee Growth Plan (EGP) scheme, were also issued in 2020, both of which are equity-settled share-based payment schemes
with the corresponding shares being the MIP A and MIP B shares respectively.

The fair value of the services received in exchange for the grant of the shares is recognised as an expense, measured based on the
grant date fair value of the shares and recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.

The TAGL Ordinary B shares and various MIP shares have no dividend or voting rights and can only be sold in limited circumstances.
The Ardonagh and Atlanta MIP shares were granted in exchange for the nominal subscription price of £0.01 per share, whilst the
subsequent EGP and Tier 1 arrangements were granted at fair value. They are convertible to ordinary shares of the Group on the
occurrence of a crystallisation event, being the earlier of a liquidity event, an IPO and a winding-up. The Group has the option to
repurchase shares if an employee leaves the Group prior to the occurrence of a crystallisation event, for an amount that depends
on whether the employee is a 'good leaver' or 'bad leaver'.

On 25 October 2021, the TAGL Tier 1 arrangements and Employee Growth Plan ('EGP') were modified by exchanging MIP A and
MIP B shares held by employees for TAGL Ordinary B shares. In introducing the modification, the Group have acquired all of the
MIP A and MIP B shares previously held by employees in exchange for issuing a total of 39,405,713 TAGL B Ordinary shares, which
hold no voting rights and the value of which is impacted by leaver provisions that are attached to them. Also, on 26 October 2021,
55,050,994 of the TAGL Ordinary B shares that were held by employee minority shareholders and other individuals providing
services to the Group were sold by those shareholders to a majority shareholder of the Group, and those TAGL Ordinary B shares
were then exchanged for an equivalent number of ordinary shares in the TAGL.

The number of shares held by employees or third parties under equity-settled share-based payment arrangements is as follows:

**33** **Share-based payments (continued)**

The grant date fair value of the scheme is calculated using a Black Scholes model, which includes discounts for the opportunity
cost of equity and lack of control. The weighted-average fair value of shares granted during the period and the significant inputs
used in the measurement of fair value were as follows:

**Ordinary B shares** **MIPA shares** **MIP B shares**
**Shares fair value** **2021** **2020** **2021** **2020** **2021** **2020**

Volatility **n/a** **n/a** **n/a** **23%** **n/a** **23%**

The total expense recognised for share-based payments is £7.4m (2020: £3.2m), comprising £1.2m (2020: £1.4m) in relation to
equity-settled share-based payment schemes and £6.2m (2020: £1.8m) in relation to cash-settled share-based payment schemes.

**Cash-settled share-based payment schemes:**

The Group operates cash-settled share-based payment schemes under which employees hold shares in some of the Group's
subsidiaries that entitle them to put those shares back to the Group for a cash amount that is based on the value of the shares.
The shares track the value of certain businesses in the Group within the Ardonagh Specialty operating segment. The fair value of
the liability is estimated based on multiples of forecast Adjusted EBITDA of the businesses whose values the shares track.

The number of shares held by employees under these schemes are as follows:

**Number of shares**


**£2.SS** **£2.10** **£20.86** **£0.02**

**2,673** **1,8S2** **l,8S2** **1,8S2**

**Bought back during the year**

**Outstanding at 31 December 2021**


**70,000**
**(25,000)**

**45,000**


The Group recognises a liability for its obligation to settle these share-based payments in cash, where that liability is measured at
the reporting date as the accrued portion of the fair value by reference to the vesting period. The Group recognised an employee
expense of £6.2m in the year ended 31 December 2021 (2020: fl.Sm), and the liability as at 31 December 2021 was £6.9m (2020:
£4.8m). £4. 7m of this liability is considered to be fully vested as at 31 December 2021.

###### FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**35** **Related party transactions**

During the year, the Group purchased shares from non-controlling interests (note 17).

On 23 February 2021, the Group granted a loan facility on arm's length commercial terms of up to £13.0m and associated
commitments to a related party of the Group to fund a business combination to be made by that related party. In connection with
the agreement to grant the loan facility, the Group also entered into an agreement to provide indemnity coverage in respect of
certain costs and liabilities for which the related party may become liable in relation to that investment or otherwise incur in
connection with the business combination, although these are not expected to arise on the basis of due diligence and the business
plan for the relevant business.

On 20 July 2021, the Group granted a convertible loan facility on arm's length commercial terms of up to £55.2m to a related party
of the Group to fund a business combination to be made by that related party. The related party drew down £35.6m of the facility
on the same date. On various dates between September 2021 and December 2021 the related party drew down a further £10.3m
from the convertible loan facility. On 29 July 2021, the entity acquired by that related party was granted an extension on a separate
additional £15.0m loan payable to the Group. That loan was repayable to the Group in August 2021 and extended on the same
terms until November 2021. A further £0.Sm was drawn down in September 2021. £7.Sm was repaid in December 2021 and at
year end this loan is repayable on demand.

On 3 September 2021, the Group issued 350,000 preference shares of nominal amount £0.01 each to existing shareholders in
exchange for £343.0m cash, which represented a £7.0m discount on the principal amount (note 32).

On 26 October 2021, the Group sold 823,757 B ordinary shares to a related party for £2.4m.

On 26 October 2021, 55,050,994 of the TAGL Ordinary B shares that were held by a majority shareholder of the Group, were
exchanged for an equivalent number of ordinary shares in the Company.

On 22 December 2021, the Group granted a convertible loan facility on arm's length commercial terms of £15.2m to a related
party of the Group to fund investment in an associate to be made by that related party. The related party drew down the facility
on the same date.

**Directors' loans**
Loans to directors were brought into the Group as a result of the purchase of Nevada Investment Topco Limited {Nevada) on 22
June 2017. The carrying amount of the Directors' loans held on the Group's balance sheet at 31 December 2021 was £1.2m (2020:
£1.2m).

There are loans to directors because loans were advanced to employees (which included directors on the same terms) to purchase
shares under the Ardonagh Group Limited Management Incentive Plan.

**Ultimate parent company**
The Ardonagh Group Limited is the Company's ultimate parent company and the highest level at which results are consolidated.
The Ardonagh Group Limited's majority shareholder is HPS Investment Partners LLC.

###### FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**37** **Subsequent events**

On 23 December 2021, the Group entered an agreement to purchase MDS SGPS sa, which is expected to complete later in 2022.

On 25 February 2022, Resilium arranged an AUD 40m debt facility that can be drawn in tranches similar to the Group's CAR facilities
outlined in note 29 Borrowings.

Subject to customary closing conditions including regulatory approvals expected to close in the first half of 2022, Ardonagh
anticipates a significant new equity investment into the Group led by existing long-term shareholders MDP and HPS, alongside
new co-investors through accounts managed by MDP and HPS, including a wholly owned subsidiary of the Abu Dhabi Investment
Authority ('ADIA'), and several other large global institutions. Under the terms of the transaction, funds affiliated with MOP will
increase their shareholding in the Group and HPS will reinvest in the Group. Co-investors, including a wholly owned subsidiary of
ADIA and several other large global institutions, will also acquire more than USO 1 billion equity through accounts managed by
MOP and HPS as part of the transaction, which values Ardonagh at USO 7.5 billion. Subject to regulatory approvals being obtained,
the new equity investment will result in the Company merging into a newly created company Tara Topco Limited ('Tara') following
which the Ardonagh Group activities will be overseen by a newly created subsidiary of Tara called Ardonagh Group Holdings
Limited.

As a result of Russia invading Ukraine, we have seen significant new sanctions legislation from a range of legislators (including the
US, EU and UK), with newly sanctioned entities and individuals, and new (or wider in scope) sectoral sanctions targeting Russia
(and Belarus). The Ardonagh Group has no appetite for potential breaches of applicable sanctions regimes. Most of the Group's
inherent risk exposure relates to international 'London Market' insurance business within Ardonagh Specialty. Our robust
framework and sophisticated control environment, which includes enhanced due diligence on Russian-linked business (prior to
accepting the client relationships) and automated daily screening of all existing clients against relevant sanctions lists are
dynamically updated as they change. The Group has also reviewed its defences against cyber risks in the context of anticipated
increases in such threats to Western companies from Russia and has reviewed its procurement processes and supplier
relationships for Russian links. Our mandatory due diligence on potential acquisitions also includes pre-completion screening of
full client and supplier lists. We continue to actively monitor the situation as it develops and will respond accordingly as new
sanctions are enacted.
