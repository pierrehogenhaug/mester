Due to the application of the acquisition method of accounting, the Unaudited Interim Financial Statements of AGHL are not directly comparable to the Audited Financial Statements of the Parent. The key differences between the net assets in the consolidated statements of financial position of AGHL and the Parent as of September 30, 2023 relate to (i) intangible assets and (ii) assets held for sale with respect to the Retail platform. The financial information for the Parent as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 is not included in this offering memorandum. With respect to intangible assets, AGHL has higher intangible assets of £2,401.9 million compared to the Parent, due to the revaluation of assets and liabilities in accordance with IFRS 3 upon acquisition of the Parent by AGHL. To acquire the Parent, AGHL issued ordinary shares and hence increased its share capital and share premium balances. AGHL also has higher non-current liabilities, specifically deferred tax liabilities of £104.0 million. With respect to held for sale assets, AGHL has higher held for sale assets of £746.3 million compared to the Parent as the result of the revaluation of the intangible assets of the Retail platform in accordance with IFRS 3 upon acquisition of the Parent by AGHL. Similarly, AGHL also has higher held for sale liabilities of £65.6 million for associated deferred tax liabilities. Additionally, AGHL has increased borrowings of £41.5 million in non-current liabilities because capitalized transaction costs are no longer recognized as a reduction in the liability due to the application of purchase price accounting. The current assets (excluding cash) of the Parent are £3.3 million higher than those of AGHL, the current liabilities of the Parent are £7.7 million lower than AGHL’s and the non-current liabilities of the Parent are £7.9 million lower than AGHL’s as a result of transactions of the parent entities of the Parent, up to and including AGHL. Cash and cash equivalents for continuing operations are the same for both AGHL and the Parent. xi ----- The consolidated statements of profit and loss and other comprehensive income of AGHL and the Parent for the nine months ended 2023 differ in that, relative to the Parent, AGHL has (i) higher amortisation of intangibles £(32.5) million, (ii) lower finance costs due to the debt fair value adjustments £(23.0) million and (iii) higher commissions and fees (due to hedge reserves written off on the formation of AGHL) £(4.8) million. Other immaterial differences relate primarily to IFRS fair value adjustments and certain operating costs of £3.1 million. AGHL has higher Reported EBITDA of £1.7 million and Adjusted EBITDA of £3.9 million compared to the Parent, primarily due to hedge reserves written off on the formation of AGHL less costs held in the intermediary companies between AGHL and the Parent. The Retail platform is shown as a discontinued operation until completion of the disposal and its financial performance is excluded entirely from the profit from continuing operations in the financial information of both AGHL and the Parent for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

We have completed or entered into acquisition agreements for more than 150 acquisitions since our establishment in 2017. We have also completed or entered into agreements for four disposals during the periods under review. See “— _Significant Factors Affecting Results of Operations—Acquisitions and Disposals” and note 11 to the_ Unaudited Interim Financial Statements and note 14 to the 2022 Audited Financial Statements and note 16 to the 2021 Audited Financial Statements for a description of the acquisitions and disposals completed during the periods under review. As a result, our financial statements may not be fully comparable between periods. As a general matter, following an acquisition of a business or group of assets, our results of operations are impacted by the results of the newly acquired business or operations, the purchase accounting for the acquisition, any debt incurred to acquire the business or operations and expenditures made to integrate the newly acquired business or operations which also affects the comparability of our results with the previous period. In addition to increasing our income through increasing our commission and fees, we incur certain costs and expenses in connection with any potential or completed acquisition. _The Retail Transaction_ In September 2023, we announced the merger and disposal of the business carried on by Atlanta Investments Holdings 3 Limited and its subsidiaries (the “Retail Business”) with Markerstudy Group Limited (the “Retail Purchaser”), with our shareholders maintaining a minority stake in the combined business. The transaction values the Retail Business at £1.2 billion. The sale of the entire issued share capital of Atlanta Investments Holdings 3 Limited to the Retail Purchaser in consideration for cash and new shares in Venus Topco Limited (the “Retail Transaction”) is subject to the terms of the sale and purchase agreement in relation to Atlanta Investments Holdings 3 Limited among Nevada Investments Topco Limited (the “Retail Seller”), the Retail Purchaser, Ardonagh Rocket Investment Holdings Limited, Tara Topco Limited and Venus Topco Limited dated 15 September 2023 (the “Retail SPA”). The Retail Transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals. As a result of this merger and the resulting disposal of the Retail platform, in our Unaudited Interim Financial Statements, we have presented Retail as held for sale on our consolidated statement of financial position as of September 30, 2023 and as a discontinued operation on our consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income for the nine months period ended September 30, 2023 and the period ended September 30, 2022. We have not restated or represented any other financial information as of or for any other period for the impact of the Retail Transaction. See “Summary—Recent _Developments—Retail Transaction” and notes 1 and 26 to the Unaudited Interim Financial Statements._ xii ----- _The Tara Transactions_ In December 2021, we announced a significant new equity investment whereby our two anchor investors, Madison Dearborn Partners and HPS Investment Partners, agreed to invest capital through new funds as part of an equity investment of over $1 billion. These investments, made through certain co-investments by large global institutions through accounts managed by Madison Dearborn Partners and HPS Investment Partners, increased our Sponsor’s shareholdings and funded minority buy-outs. Following completion of this transaction (the “Tara Transactions”), the corporate structure of the Group changed. On May 31, 2022, The Ardonagh Group Limited, the entity at which we previously reported our results, merged into the Group’s new indirect parent company, Tara Topco Limited. Following this merger, on June 1, 2022, AGHL acquired Ardonagh New Midco 3 Limited, including the Group companies that were previously owned by The Ardonagh Group Limited, and became the reporting entity for the Group. AGHL’s first reporting period included all transactions since its incorporation on December 8, 2021 to December 31, 2022. The nine-month period ended September 30, 2022, however, only includes four months of the results of operations and cash flows of the consolidated operations of AGHL due to the timing of the Tara Transactions. Accordingly, AGHL’s results during any period ended in 2022 are not comparable to any other period presented. We have accounted for the Tara Transactions using the acquisition method of accounting under IFRS 3, Business Combinations, applying purchase accounting adjustments that resulted, among others, in the recognition of intangibles (including goodwill) and deferred tax liabilities in our financial information. Due to the application of the acquisition method of accounting, the Unaudited Interim Financial Statements of AGHL are not directly comparable to the Audited Financial Statements of the Parent.

Adjusted EBITDA-based measures are not a measurement of performance or liquidity under IFRS and you should not consider Adjusted EBITDA-based measures as an alternative to (i) profit (as determined in accordance with IFRS) as a measure of our performance, (ii) cash flow for the period as a measure of our ability to meet our cash needs or (iii) any other measure of performance or liquidity under IFRS. Total Income-based measures should not be considered as an alternate to our reported commission and fees and other income. We present Adjusted EBITDA-based measures and Total Income-based measures as we believe that they are a measure commonly used by investors and are a measure that we use in managing each of our businesses. Adjusted EBITDA-based measures and Total Income-based measures are included in this offering memorandum because we believe that they provide a useful measure of our results of operations; however, these measures do not constitute measures of financial performance under IFRS and you should not consider Adjusted EBITDA-based measures or Total Income-based measures as an alternative to profit, commission and fees or any other performance measure derived in accordance with IFRS or as a measure of our results of operations or liquidity. Other companies, including those in our xvii ----- industry, may calculate similarly titled financial measures differently from us, and therefore such financial measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. The Adjusted EBITDA-based measures and Total Income-based measures presented in this offering memorandum are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties. They do not present our reported results of operations for the twelve months ended September 30, 2023, and are not comparable to the Financial Statements or other financial information included elsewhere in this offering memorandum. In addition, the Adjusted EBITDA-based measures and Total Income-based measures do not purport to indicate our future consolidated results of operations. Our actual results may differ significantly from those reflected in these Adjusted EBITDA-based measures and Total Income-based measures. The calculations of these Adjusted EBITDA-based measures and Total Income-based measures are based on various assumptions and management estimates, are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties and may not give an accurate or complete picture of the financial condition or results of operations of any entity prior to it being acquired by us. The underlying financial information in the Adjusted EBITDA-based measures and Total Income-based measures may not be prepared on as basis comparable to our consolidated financial statements or the other financial information included in this offering memorandum. Accordingly, none of the Adjusted EBITDA-based measures and Total Income-based measures should be relied upon when making an investment decision.

Our non-IFRS measures are defined by us as set out below. We define “Adjusted EBITDA” as Reported EBITDA after adding back management reconciling items. See “Summary Historical Financial Information and Other Data—Other Consolidated Financial and _Pro Forma Data.” We also present Adjusted EBITDA by reporting segment._ We define “Adjusted EBITDA margin” as Adjusted EBITDA divided by Total Income expressed as a percentage. We define “Adjusted EBITDA Pro Forma for Q4 Growth and Transactions” as Adjusted EBITDA Pro Forma for Completed Transactions adjusted for Pro Forma for Q4 2023 Growth and Transactions.

We define “management operating cash flow” as Adjusted EBITDA less business working capital movement (including movements in net insurer balances, pre-payments, accrued income, other debtors, accruals, deferred income, accounts payable, certain other creditors and provisions, excluding any balances relating to management reconciling items, financing and corporation tax) and maintenance capital expenditure (excluding purchases of renewal rights). We define “management reconciling items” as transformational hires, business transformation costs, legacy costs, other costs, regulatory costs, acquisition and financing costs, gain on revaluation of associate and investments and profit on disposal of businesses. We define “net free cash flow” as free cash flow, including proceeds from disposals, less M&A, equity & debt purchases, plus drawings under our Revolving Credit Facility, less financing and associated costs and regulatory costs. xv ----- We define “operating cash conversion” as management operating cash flow divided by Adjusted EBITDA. We define “organic growth” as growth (expressed as a percentage) in Total Income for the period (the “current period”) on a constant perimeter basis as of the last day of the previous period (the “comparative period”) less any income contribution in the current period of the businesses acquired in the comparative period for the time that corresponds to the time in the comparative period prior to their respective acquisitions, as compared to (ii) the Total Income for the comparative period. Organic growth includes organic income growth of businesses acquired in the comparative period. The organic growth for the twelve months ended September 30, 2023 excludes any contribution of Hemsley Wynne Furlong. We define “Pro Forma for Completed Transactions” as adjustments to give pro forma effect to (i) acquisitions completed during the period and (ii) financing transactions, in each case, as if they had occurred on the first day of the period. We define “Pro Forma for Q4 2023 Growth and Transactions” as adjusted to give effect to as Total Income Pro Forma for Completed Transactions, as adjusted to give effect to (i) all material acquisitions completed between October 1, 2023 and December 31, 2023, including certain cost and procurement synergies, and the disposal of AccuRisk following its sale in the fourth quarter of 2023, in each case, as if they had occurred on October 1, 2022; (ii) organic growth for the three months for the three months ended December 31, 2023, calculated as the Adjusted EBITDA or revenue contribution, as applicable, for the three months ended December 12023, less the Adjusted EBITDA or revenue contribution, as applicable, of the three months ended December 31, 2022, in each case, on a constant perimeter as of September 30, 2023; and (iii) acquisition synergies and operational efficiencies across the Group. We define “Reported EBITDA” as total loss for the period after adding back profit after tax from discontinued operations, finance costs, tax credit, depreciation, amortisation, impairment of nonfinancial assets, profit/loss from disposal of assets, foreign exchange movements, MSA recharge and dividends. We define “Total Income” as the sum of commission and fees, other income, investment income and finance income.

For a detailed description of the adjustments made to Adjusted EBITDA and Total Income, see “Summary—Summary Historical Financial Information and Other Data—Other Consolidated _Financial and Pro Forma Data” and See “Summary—Summary Historical Financial Information and Other Data—Other As Adjusted Income Data of Ardonagh Group Holdings Limited.”_ We present these non-IFRS measures because we believe that they are widely used by securities analysts and other interested parties as supplemental measures of performance and liquidity. The non-IFRS measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and should not be considered in isolation or be used as a substitute for an analysis of our operating result as reported under IFRS. Non-IFRS measures and ratios are not measurements of our performance or liquidity under IFRS and should not be considered as alternatives to net profit/loss for the period or any other xvi ----- performance measures derived in accordance with IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting principles or as alternatives to cash flow from operating, investing or financing activities. The non-IFRS measures have limitations as analytical tools. Some of these limitations are: - they do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; - they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; - they do not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary, to service interest or principal payments, on our debts; - although amortisation and depreciation are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often need to be replaced in the future and certain of these non-IFRS measures do not reflect any cash requirements that would be required for such replacements; - they are not adjusted for all non-cash income or expense items that are reflected in our statements of cash flows; - they may differ from similarly titled measures presented by other companies; - some of the exceptional items that we eliminate in calculating Adjusted EBITDA-based measures, reflect cash payments that were made, or will in the future be made; - certain Adjusted EBITDA-based measures and Total Income-based measures include entities that were not owned by the Group during the entire period presented and are based on preliminary and unaudited information that may not be fully comparable to the information of the Group; - certain Adjusted EBITDA-based measures and Total Income-based measures include the impact of transactions that we expect to completed in the near-term but there may be some uncertainty around the occurrence or timing of completion; and - the further adjustments made in calculating Adjusted EBITDA-based measures and Total Income-based measures are those that management consider are not representative of the underlying operations of the Ardonagh Group and therefore are subjective in nature.",N/A,as_expected,2024,879

In September 2023, we announced the merger and sale of our Retail Business to Markerstudy in a transaction valuing the business at £1.2 billion. See “Summary—Recent Developments—Retail Transaction.” For the twelve months ended September 30, 2023 and excluding Retail, we generated gross written premiums (“GWP”) of £12 billion, commissions and fees of £1.2 billion, Total Pro Forma Income of £1.6 billion, organic growth of 11.6%, Total Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA of £555.8 million and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA margin of 33%. We offer a broad range of non-life insurance products in multiple geographies, ranging from higher value and lower volume bespoke corporate insurance products placed in the London Market, to SMB business insurance policies. Each aspect of our business is highly diversified with limited concentration or dependence on any single product, channel, carrier, income producer, or supplier. We combine this diversified operating model with a highly collaborative culture across the Group to provide our clients, carriers, and employees with a high-quality product and service offering. We serve a wide range of clients that include large multinational corporations (“MNCs”), small and medium enterprises (“SMEs”), individual consumers, and other third-party brokers and managing general agents (“MGAs”). We distribute our insurance products across multiple channels, including through a network of over 120 local offices in the United Kingdom and more than 150 offices worldwide, and online. Our global network provides the basis for deep, embedded local relationships and “trusted advisor” status with clients and benefits from long-standing trusted insurer partner relationships. We also maintain regional hubs to support our businesses through shared resources and expertise. Following the signing of the Retail Transaction, we have taken steps to organize our business into two main reporting segments, which we refer to as platforms, that focus on distinct but complementary aspects of the insurance brokerage and services value chain.

We have a depth of specialist and local knowledge built-up over many years, and entrenched client relationships and deep community penetration. We believe that our scale and diversified proposition provides us with the ability to effectively compete with even our largest competitors and service over four million clients as a result of our broad industry knowledge and depth of understanding of customer needs from our team of over 8,000 professionals across more than 150 offices globally. The scale of premium we place in the market also allows us to capture incremental earnings across the insurance value chain and reduce costs. As a leading global independent insurance broker, we are well positioned to continue to benefit from the resilient and growing global non-life insurance market. The global non-life insurance market has proven highly resilient across cycles and recessions, and has been continually growing. The global nonlife market has experienced growth of approximately 3% per annum over the past twenty years, and has demonstrated resilience through a long track record of stable GWP growth with limited impact from past economic or capital market downturns as demonstrated by the below chart. 3 ----- _Source: Swiss Re Institute_ As compared to other sectors, our sector benefits from low volatility and proved to be one of the most resilient sectors through the COVID-19 pandemic. The growth in the industry is supported by favorable market dynamics. Brokers can, in middle market segments, promote strong client relations as a result of this low volatility and foster recurring revenue. We were able to maintain organic growth of approximately 3% from 2017 through 2020, and increased organic growth (excluding Retail) of 10.2%, 12.5% and 11.6% in 2021, 2022 and the twelve months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.

We established Ardonagh Global Partners in 2021 to invest in strong platforms operating in attractive markets and verticals outside the UK and Europe and to partner with management teams who want to grow faster as part of a larger group while retaining operational independence. Since its inception, Ardonagh Global Partners has grown to include Resilium, one of Australia’s largest independently-owned intermediary networks and the founding business of our Australia platform, and Ethos Broking Australia, which invests in or directly acquires brokers. Ardonagh Global Partners also includes Hemsley Wynne Furlonge, a specialist M&A warranty and indemnity insurance broker and advisor, MDS Group, an insurance broker and risk management advisor across the Portuguese-speaking world and Europe, the only Portuguese Lloyd’s Broker and the largest independent broker in Brazil, and Envest, an Australian-based insurance investment and distribution group, which now houses Australian assets Resilium and Epsilon Underwriting within the Group.",N/A,as_expected,2024,879

We offer a wide-ranging product portfolio across both general and bespoke insurance products and services across the insurance value chain, including personal and commercial lines, wholesale distribution, underwriting and insurance outsourcing services to large corporations, insurers, third-party brokers, SMEs, and individual consumers at a variety of price points, without assuming any underwriting or principal risk in relation to any of the services or products that we provide. For the twelve months ended September 30, 2023, no single line of business accounted for more than 20% of GWP.

As a result of our international presence, our GWP is diversified by geography, with 66% of our premium (excluding the Retail Transaction) placed outside the UK (specifically, 30% of our premium is placed in North America and 15% is placed in Europe). We have long-standing partnerships with key carriers, and relationships more broadly with a wide range of insurance carriers in each of the markets that we serve. Our large number of carrier relationships mitigates potential carrier concentration risks and enables us to enhance and improve our product offerings for clients as well as pricing and our own 5 ----- commercial terms. For the twelve months ended September 30, 2023, no single carrier accounted for more than 7% of our total GWP, with the top five carriers in aggregate representing less than 25% of total GWP. Our gross written premiums by geographical region, class of business and carrier are shown in the chart below: (1) LTM premiums to September 2023; pro forma to exclude Retail and include Assepro. Our highly diversified offering ensures minimal reliance on any particular product, distribution channel, customer, or market, limiting our exposure to any adverse industry developments and macroeconomic factors and thereby mitigating volatility in our overall financial performance.

We have built our Specialty Broking business by investing in carefully strategic producer hires and specialisms. In the past three years, we have expanded our addressable markets through acquisitions in new synergistic geographies. In 2020, we acquired our first non-UK business, Arachas, Ireland’s largest commercial insurance broker, which kick-started our international operations. We have since established our latest standalone platform, International Advisory, under which we are consolidating our non-UK broking enterprises and related investments and under which we have launched our Ardonagh Europe and our Ardonagh Global Partners businesses. We established Ardonagh Global Partners in 2021 to invest in leading platforms operating in attractive markets and verticals outside the UK and Europe and to partner with management teams who want to grow faster as part of a larger group while retaining operational independence.

For example, we have used data and analytics to significantly improve and re-package older previous products into better terms, cover and product for our clients, including improvements on the Terrorism, Fine Art Jewellery and Specie facilities. We have also used data and analytics to introduce brand new facilities to the market, such as a Construction facility and a cross-class facility named LECTIO. The following chart shows our centralized data analytics structure, where we have centralized global premium and carrier information using our data center based in Mullingar, Ireland. As an example, in our Specialty Broking platform, we have built facilities such as the Ardonagh Portfolio Solutions (“APS”) business to use data analytics and capabilities to bring benefits to both clients, in terms of wider market placement, and our Group, in terms of increased revenues. Our technology and scale facilities have also allowed us to identify cost savings totalling approximately £15.8 million that we expect to achieve within the next 12 months. In our Global P&C: UK Advisory segment, we expect cost savings of £3.2 million, primarily as a result of a target model implementation project that has reduced headcount through efficiency gains from optimizing policy administration systems, an IT transformation from improving the office network, which is aimed at removing legacy applications and outsourcing, and an onshoring finance project expected to deliver benefits from process efficiencies and automation. In our Global P&C: International Advisory segment, we expect cost savings of £3.9 million from synergies through our hub-and-spoke model and by integrating further acquisitions into our existing platforms.

We have a growing pipeline of new specialist products that is highly complementary to our existing offerings, including high net worth, political violence, specialty terrorism facility. These products are being developed on existing systems and channels at limited upfront cost and are largely linked to new hires, who can contribute the relevant product and channel expertise. As an example, new products launched in our Specialty Broking platform contributed towards organic growth of approximately 11.6% in the twelve months ended September 30, 2023. As part of our organic growth strategy, we are also focused on cross-selling and up-selling and customer retention and expansion. We seek to improve cross-selling and up-selling across Group clients, including by leveraging data. We have rolled out of a Group-wide database in which we collate data from each of our platforms to enable a “single view of the client” (i.e., how many policies are linked to each client across personal and commercial lines) to facilitate retention, cross-selling and up-selling. This database continues to provide a more granular understanding of our clients’ needs, allowing us to offer them tailored cross-selling opportunities. We have also implemented a bespoke pricing system and leveraged our data infrastructure, fraud detection capabilities and access to third-party data sources to improve retention and increase customer lifetime value across most products. In our Specialty Broking platform, we have developed a highly sophisticated customer and broker-facing software which interfaces with several market-leading policy administrative systems and substantially improves ease of access to customer and broker data. We are also in discussions with several third-party brokers who are clients of our wholesale platform to roll-out this software in order to maximize efficiency and centralization within our platform and improve the experience of third-party brokers on our platform. We also intend to leverage our membership of the Worldwide Broker Network to increase existing business and in-flow through the establishment of new relationships and intend to capitalize on our existing global footprint to drive further growth. In the UK, our UK Advisory business launched a focused client strategy aimed at large UK corporates, which is already bearing fruit with the successful signing of several marquee clients, including a global broadcaster that has a £5 billion turnover and also the UK’s largest charity.

Our strategy is based on three key pillars of excellence, which are: - _Capacity excellence. We seek to reach capacity excellence by operating a strategic capacity model through our Ardonagh Portfolio Solutions (“APS”) business, part of our Specialty Broking platform. APS utilizes data captured from across the Group’s platforms and businesses to enhance income through a centralized placement. We expect our APS business to be a key growth driver going forward by allowing us to capitalize on a select number of strategic carrier relationships, create market leading products which offer better terms for our customers and access alternative capital providers either directly or in connection with our MGA business. We intend to engage with APS for select high-profitability lines and actively manage the portfolio to reduce exposure to underperforming lines. - _Talent excellence.

Any acquisition we pursue will be in line with our targeted and selective acquisition criteria focused on companies with attractive profitability, growth potential and complementary business operations. We utilize our network to identify suitable targets at reasonable multiples. We support acquired assets post-acquisition in order to achieve our organic growth plans going forward, utilizing our expertise and networks. We also manage the realization of identified revenue and cost synergies on an ongoing basis. We have a highly disciplined and proven acquisition program, which includes a standardized approach to integration and synergy delivery, which, together with the proven execution ability of our management team and our strong focus on value creation and financial metrics, allows us to maximize synergies and rapidly deploy economies of scale to acquired businesses. We have a robust M&A pipeline underpinned by a rigorous evaluation and assessment process driven by an experienced and dedicated team of M&A professionals, and we continue to explore larger transaction opportunities both in the UK and internationally with a strong focus on market-leading platforms in our international business. Acquisitions completed during the fourth quarter of 2023 (including the impact of the AccuRisk disposal) contributed Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA of £13.6 million for the twelve months ended September 30, 2023, and acquisitions completed between January 1, 2024 and February 1, 2024 contributed an additional £3.0 million. We have a further 36 acquisitions that are contractually committed or under signed letter of intent as of February 1, 2024, which would contribute an additional £32.2 million of Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA. Our pipeline includes targets on multiple continents. We are also actively pursuing other acquisitions in the near-term or very nearterm, including one or more potentially material acquisitions.",N/A,as_expected,2024,879
1923_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,9,SUMMARY,9.4,Recent Developments,9.4.1,Retail Transaction,"In September 2023, we announced the merger and disposal of the Retail Business with the Markerstudy Group Limited (the “Merged Business”), with our shareholders maintaining a minority stake in the Merged Business. The transaction values the Retail Business at £1.2 billion and will be funded by a new investment led by Pollen Street Capital and Bain Capital Special Situations. We expect to receive upfront cash consideration of up to £820 million (on a debt free/cash free basis, excluding transaction fees and expenses, and deferred cash consideration linked to related investments) and an approximately £400 million promissory note receivable from a related-party entity (“RP Entity”). The RP Entity is wholly owned by our shareholders and will, with Retail management, receive a 23% equity stake in the Merged Business. The promissory note receivable to be entered into in connection with the completion of the Retail Transaction will accrue interest at a fixed rate of 15% (compounding annually), which will be mandatorily prepaid on any realization of the stake in the Merged Business or a change of control of the RP Entity, and will require the RP Entity not to incur debt, grant security or make distributions 14 ----- without the consent of our Group. We expect to distribute this promissory note receivable to a parent entity of the Parent following the completion of the Retail Transactions. In addition, certain exiting managers will continue to hold shares in management incentive plans within the Group following the completion of the Retail Transactions, and we will buyback such manager’s shares upon exit or otherwise winding up such plan. The Retail Transaction is subject to the satisfaction of certain closing conditions, including customary regulatory and antitrust approvals from both the FCA and the CMA. We expect completion of the Retail Transaction to occur in the second or third quarter of 2024. The Retail Transaction is subject to customary transaction risks, including of delay due to longer than expected regulatory reviews or actions. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—The Retail Transaction may _be delayed or may not proceed to completion.”_ As a result of the Retail Transaction, in our Unaudited Interim Financial Statements, we have presented Retail as held for sale on our consolidated statement of financial position as of September 30, 2023 and as a discontinued operation on our consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income for the nine months period ended September 30, 2023 and the period ended September 30, 2022. We expect a significant portion of the cash proceeds from the Retail Transaction will be applied, subject to certain exceptions and limits, in mandatorily prepaying at par a portion of our New Senior Secured Credit Facilities. More generally, we expect the Retail Transaction to release capital to invest in our higher-growth Specialty Broking and our Global P&C Platforms. See also “Business—Retail—Retail _Transaction.”_ If the Retail Transaction does not proceed to completion, our ratio of as adjusted total net debt to Total Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA would be 5.8x, as calculated by adjusting as adjusted total net debt to remove the net proceeds from the Retail Transaction, including Retail Total EBITDA, and adding Lease Liabilities associated with the Retail Divestiture.",N/A,as_expected,2024,879

In October 2023, we increased our borrowings by drawing $130.0 million of USD Facility B6 under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement. As of December 31, 2023, we had £283 million equivalent of undrawn Facilities consisting of $182.5 million and $171.7 million respectively under USD Facilities B5 and B6 of our Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement.

For a summary of the material financing arrangements identified in the diagram, see “Description of Other _Indebtedness and Financing Arrangements” and “Description of the Notes.” _ (1) As of the date of this offering memorandum, 31.15% of the voting interests in Tara Topco Limited are owned, indirectly, by funds managed, advised and/or controlled by HPS Investment Partners, LLC (“HPS”) or its affiliates, 67.48% of the voting interests are owned by entities affiliated with MDP and the remaining 1.37% of voting interests are held by other minority shareholders. See “Shareholders” and “Management—Management Equity Interests.” (2) Following completion of the Tara Transactions on May 30, 2022, the corporate structure of the Group changed. This impacted our financial information as we previously reported our results at the level of The Ardonagh Group Limited. On May 31, 2022, The Ardonagh Group Limited merged into the Group’s new indirect parent company, Tara Topco Limited. Following this merger, AGHL acquired Ardonagh New Midco 3 Limited, including the Group companies that were previously owned by The Ardonagh Group Limited, on June 1, 2022, and has become the reporting entity for the Group. See “Presentation of Financial Information.” (3) The Parent, which will be a Guarantor of the Senior Notes, is the top entity in the restricted group under the Senior Indenture and the direct parent of the Senior Notes Issuer. Upon consummation of the Offering, the Senior Notes Issuer will on-loan the proceeds of the Senior Notes Offering to the Parent and enter into the Senior Proceeds Loan. (4) The Senior Notes Issuer is a private limited liability company incorporated under the laws of Jersey for the purpose of the Transactions and other potential transactions and is not expected to engage in any activities other than those related to its formation, the Transactions and other future transactions permitted by the Senior Indenture.

The Senior Notes Issuer’s only material assets and liabilities will be its outstanding indebtedness under the Senior Notes, the receivable under the Senior Proceeds Loan, any other future indebtedness and certain intercompany balances, and any other assets or liabilities that arise as a result of transactions not prohibited by the Senior Indenture. The Senior Notes Issuer’s rights under the Senior Proceeds Loan will be assigned to the Security Agent and form part of the Topco Collateral. 19 ----- (5) The Senior Notes Issuer is offering $1,000,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes.

Given the regulated nature of our business, we have limited ability to grant upstream credit support. As a result, the Issuers and the Guarantors will represent approximately 4.3% of our Adjusted EBITDA (including Retail) for the twelve months ended September 30, 2023. We have granted security in respect of the Senior Secured Notes from additional non-guarantor entities, which together with the Issuers and the Guarantors, represent 52.1% of our Adjusted EBITDA (including Retail) for the twelve months ended September 30, 2023.

Certain proceeds of the New EUR Term Facility and the New USD Term Facility will be on-lent to the Company. 20 ----- (10) The SFA Borrowers, among others, are expected to enter into the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement on or prior to the Escrow Release Date. The Guarantors (other than the Parent) will guarantee the Secured Credit Facilities on a pari passu basis with the Senior Secured Note Guarantees (although any liabilities in respect of obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility will have priority with respect to the application of the proceeds from the distressed disposal of, or enforcement of, the Collateral) and on a senior basis to the Senior Note Guarantees. The Secured Credit Facilities and certain hedging obligations will be secured on a first-priority basis by the Shared Collateral. See “Description of Other Indebtedness and Financing Arrangements—Senior _Secured Credit Facilities Agreement.”_ (11) As of the date of this offering memorandum, we had a 100% interest in our subsidiaries other than as specified under “Business— _Our Subsidiaries.” See also “Management.” The minority shareholders in our subsidiaries may receive certain distributions ahead_ of distributions made to holders of the Notes.

As a result of the limited comparability between the consolidated statement of profit and loss of AGHL for the period ended September 30, 2022 and the nine months ended 2023, we have not presented the consolidated statement of profit and loss of AGHL for the period ended September 30, 2022 in this table. See “Presentation of Financial Information” and notes 1 and 26 to the Unaudited Interim Financial Statements. (3) As a result of the Retail Transaction, Retail is presented as a discontinued operation in the consolidated statement of loss and other comprehensive income in the financial information of AGHL for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and the twelve months ended September 30, 2023, and therefore excluded from the results presented in the above table. See “Presentation of Financial _Information” and note 26 to the Unaudited Interim Financial Statements._ 40 ----- (4) In the 2022 Audited Financial Statements, the Parent changed the presentation of investment income and it is now presented as part of finance income. This change in presentation was reflected also in the comparative period. As such, the line items investment income, operating profit and finance income for the year ended 31 December 2021 included in this offering memorandum and derived from the 2021 Audited Financial Statements differ from the same line items in the 2021 comparative column in the 2022 Audited Financial Statements. The information for the year ended December 31, 2020 also does not reflect this change in presentation. 41 -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,879

(4) We define profit from disposal of assets as the disposal of property, plant and equipment, right-of-use assets and intangible assets. (5) We define foreign exchange movements as gains/losses arising on the revaluation of monetary items (debtors, creditors, cash, etc.) and on derivatives to which hedge accounting has not been applied. (6) We define MSA recharge as group management services charges which cover the transaction costs associated with previous refinancing or capital structuring projects. (7) The adjustment for transformational hires includes the removal of costs for hiring new teams or individual employees with experience from industries or product lines in which the Group does not have existing operations. It includes costs associated with buying out new hires of existing contracts, bonus schemes, sign-on deals and any net losses associated with new joiners who have annual salaries of at least £80,000 (or the equivalent in jurisdictions outside the United Kingdom) up to the first year after any capacity or covenant restriction. (8) The adjustment for business transformation costs includes the removal of certain costs incurred in achieving synergies from enhancing existing business processes, such as restructuring and investing in new systems, cost savings and process improvements. (9) The adjustment for legacy costs includes the removal of the costs associated with resolving legacy issues within the Group that are not related to the Group’s current trading activity and have been corrected over time. The amount of adjustments related to legacy costs has reduced period-on-period during the periods presented. (10) We define other costs as costs that are outside of the normal course of business, including (i) costs incurred in 2020 and 2021 that are directly attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic that would not have been incurred otherwise, (ii) professional fee relating to a transaction involving an equity investment into The Ardonagh Group Limited, including post-deal advice to the Group’s investors in relation to non-cash MIPs; and (iii) non-cash MIP and share based payment charged in the Ireland P&C segment of the Global P&C platform relating to Arachas.

(12) We define acquisition and financing costs as costs associated with acquiring businesses, with disposing of parts of the business, with raising additional financing (legal and accounting advisors, rating agencies, etc.), and with a change in the value of contingent consideration (after the measurement period has ended). (13) Pro Forma for Completed Transactions are adjustments to give pro forma effect to (i) all acquisitions completed during the period, and (ii) financing transactions, in each case, as if they had occurred on the first day of the period.

(18) Pro Forma Transactions under LOI are adjustments that give pro forma effect to 36 acquisitions across Europe, Australia, Brazil, the United Kingdom and Ireland that are contractually committed or subject to a signed letter of intent and at an advanced stage of negotiations as of February 1, 2024, expected to complete by the end of the second quarter of 2024, including expected cost and procurement synergies, as if they had occurred on the first day of the period. (19) This adjustment reflects the EBITDA contribution of producer hires, who have not yet reached maturity, assuming their production at 100% maturity, net of assumed bonuses. We estimate the expected contribution of transformational hires at maturity based on the investment case with a 25% haircut at the time of the respective addition to the business and adjusted following regular subsequent sensitivity assessments on a team-by-team basis based on performance and market conditions.

Following this merger, on June 1, 2022, AGHL acquired Ardonagh New Midco 3 Limited, including the Group companies that were previously owned by The Ardonagh Group Limited, and became the reporting entity for the Group. AGHL’s first reporting period included all transactions since its incorporation on December 8, 2021 to December 31, 2022. The nine-month period ended September 30, 2022, however, only includes four months of the results of operations and cash flows of the consolidated operations of AGHL due to the timing of the Tara Transactions. Accordingly, AGHL’s results during any period ended in 2022 are not comparable to any other period presented. We have accounted for the Tara Transactions using the acquisition method of accounting under IFRS 3, Business Combinations, applying purchase accounting adjustments that resulted, among others, in the recognition of intangibles (including goodwill) and deferred tax liabilities in our financial information. Due to the application of the acquisition method of accounting, the Unaudited Interim Financial Statements of AGHL are not directly comparable to the Audited Financial Statements of the Parent. See “Presentation of Financial Information—Differences in the Financial Statements of AGHL and the Parent.” To aid comparability between periods, the_ _following summary historical (i) consolidated statement of financial position as of December 31, 2022 and the consolidated statement of profit or loss and consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2022 have been derived from the 2022 Audited Financial Statements of the Parent which have been prepared in accordance with IFRS and are included elsewhere in this offering memorandum, (ii) consolidated statement of profit or loss and consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2021 have been derived from the 2021 Audited Financial Statements of the Parent which have been prepared in accordance with IFRS and are included elsewhere in this offering memorandum, (iii) consolidated statement of financial position as of December 31, 2021 have been derived from the comparative column in the 2022 Audited Financial Statements of the Parent, due to the restatement of trade and other receivables and retained losses, (iv) consolidated statement of financial position as of December 31, 2020 and the consolidated statement of profit or loss and consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended December 30, 2020 have been derived from the comparative column in the 2021 Audited Financial Statements of the Parent and (v) consolidated statement of profit or loss, consolidated statement of financial position, and consolidated statement of cash flows as of and for the period ended September 30, 2022 and the nine months ended September 30, 2023 have been derived from the Unaudited Interim Financial Statements of AGHL which have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 and are included elsewhere in this offering memorandum. In addition, in September 2023, we announced the Retail Transaction. As a result of this merger and the resulting disposal of the Retail platform, in our Unaudited Interim Financial Statements, we have presented Retail as held for sale on our consolidated statement of financial position as of September 30, 2023 and as a discontinued operation on our consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income for the nine months period ended September 30, 2023 and the period ended September 30, 2022. We have not restated or represented any other financial information as of or for any other period for the impact of the Retail Transaction.

1923_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Business and Industry,13.1.1,Our business may be adversely affected by a decline in economic conditions in the United Kingdom or globally and by other market risks.,"We generate a significant portion of our revenues in the United Kingdom. As a result, we are particularly affected by economic developments and regulatory and political changes in the United Kingdom and are also affected by any similar developments across Europe or markets globally that may impact economic conditions in the United Kingdom or in other markets in which we operate. Economic difficulties, increased competition between insurers due to economic downturns and other factors may cause the premium rates on which our commissions are based to decline. In addition, any significant reduction or delay by customers in purchasing insurance or making payment of premiums could have a negative impact on our business. Factors such as declining business and consumer confidence, lower household income and consumer spending, inflation, downturns in the property market and other economic challenges could have a significant negative impact on the buying behavior of our commercial and individual customers. Insolvencies associated with continuing economic uncertainty could adversely affect our business through the loss of customers or by hindering our ability to place insurance. Due to their size, our SME business customers may be more vulnerable to any economic downturn and may be more prone to insolvency than larger commercial customers. Despite an improvement in global economic conditions in 2021 and 2022 following the sharp global economic downturn in 2020 resulting from the first waves of the COVID-19 pandemic, as of the date of this offering memorandum, the outlook for the global economy remains highly uncertain, and certain markets, including Europe, may not achieve the growth rates that they have forecasted or historically observed. Such uncertainty has been exacerbated by rising global turmoil resulting from the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine. In particular, the Russia-Ukraine conflict has resulted in severe political, social and economic consequences in the countries directly involved in the conflict as well as more broadly on the European continent, as tensions between Russia, the European Union, the United States, the United Kingdom and other countries continue to increase. The ongoing war in Ukraine has also been a driver behind a surge in energy and transportation prices in 2022, which has been, and may continue to be, a key factor in driving inflationary pressures and may ultimately adversely affect general economic conditions and in turn our results of operations. Separately, in early October 2023, Hamas and Israel began an armed conflict which may potentially spread to surrounding Middle Eastern countries. The length, outcome and consequences of the Hamas-Israel military conflict remain highly unpredictable. We are unable to predict the short- or long-term implications of these conflicts, which could include but are not limited to further sanctions, uncertainty about economic and political stability, increases in inflation rates and energy prices, supply chain challenges and adverse effects on currency exchange rates and financial markets. The tensions arising from the Russian invasion of Ukraine and a potential escalation of the ongoing military confrontation between Israel and Hamas could also further increase other political tensions and hamper international trade. A new economic recession, energy and logistics issues, further political and economic instability and escalating geopolitical tensions in Europe or globally could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products, our business and our results of operations. Supply and labor market disruptions caused by various factors, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, accommodative monetary and fiscal policy, have contributed to significant inflation in many of the 51 ----- markets in which we operate. In addition to inflation contributing to reductions or delays by customers in purchasing insurance or making payment of premiums, inflation impacts the costs to attract and retain employees and other costs to run and invest in our business. If our costs grow significantly in excess of our ability to raise revenues, our margins and results of operations may be materially and adversely impacted and we may not be able to achieve our strategic and financial objectives. Furthermore, while our fees are generally calculated as a percentage of transactions, and as such increase proportionally with inflation, inflation could cause clients to request flat fees. Any future developments in respect of the COVID-19 pandemic or any other future outbreak of another virus or other contagious disease are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope and duration of an outbreak and actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response thereto, including further quarantine measures. A resurgence in COVID-19 or any future outbreak of another virus or other contagious disease may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. Any of the aforementioned factors, individually or in the aggregate, that negatively impact the UK insurance market, the UK economy more generally, or European or global economic growth and stability more generally could increase our operating costs and impose additional regulatory burdens and could also have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. If a significant insurer fails or withdraws from writing certain insurance coverage that we offer our clients, overall underwriting capacity in the industry could be negatively affected, which could reduce our placement of certain lines and types of insurance. An insurer with whom we place business ceasing to operate could also result in errors and omissions claims by our clients. This or any other negative economic developments in the United Kingdom could reduce customer confidence or limit the demand for our insurance products and as a result could negatively affect earnings and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2024,879

Our commissions are generally based on insurance premiums, which are cyclical in nature and may vary widely based on market conditions. Competition, economic difficulties, changes in the insurance premium tax or other factors may change the underlying cost bases of insurance providers and as a result may cause premium rates to decline. As we cannot determine the timing and extent of premium rate changes, we may not be able to accurately forecast our commission income, including whether it will significantly decline. As insurance companies continue to outsource the issuance of insurance policies to non-affiliated agents and brokers such as ourselves, they may seek to further bring down their expenses by reducing commission rates payable to such organizations. Additionally, changes in the manner in which discount rates or other rates related to claims costs are calculated could result in the rates rising or falling and could lead insurers to adjust commission rates. A significant reduction in commissions, along with general volatility or declines in premiums, could have a significant adverse effect on our business, our generation of revenue and our financial condition. Profit commissions are less predictable than traditional commission and we are consequently less able to forecast the amount of profit commissions that we will receive. On a longer time horizon, the insurance markets might be disrupted by new technologies, “open finance” or new distribution structures, which may give rise to both risks and opportunities for us. We derive a small portion of our income from profit commissions from insurance companies. Profit commissions are typically dependent upon the profitability of the business placed with the insurer. We are less able to forecast profit commissions than premium-based commissions due to the link with variable insurance events and the inherent volatility this brings. As the profitability of our MGA division is in part dependent upon the ratio of claims made to total underwriting business placed, and as a significant amount of the underwriting business that we place insures risk in the United Kingdom, 52 ----- catastrophic events, whether natural or otherwise, may affect the amount of claims being made and therefore the profitability of the business which we placed. Insurance companies may also seek to negotiate profit sharing agreements with less favorable terms to us as a result of a decrease in the profitability of the business we place with them. Furthermore, we have a significant amount of trade accounts receivable from some of the insurance companies with which we place insurance. If those third-parties experience liquidity problems or other financial difficulties, there is a risk we could encounter delays or defaults in payments owed to us. If we are unable to correctly forecast the amount of profit commissions that we will receive for the above or any other reasons, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be negatively impacted.",N/A,as_expected,2024,879

Achieving operational efficiencies across our portfolio may involve unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of our management’s attention or of our financial and other resources. While we have generated certain operational efficiencies in the past and believe we can continue to generate such efficiencies, we can provide no assurance that we will realize our goals in a timely manner or at all. Furthermore, while we believe that expected operational efficiencies from recent and planned acquisitions are based on reasonable assumptions and diligence, actual developments may differ significantly from our expectations. The failure to achieve our vision in terms of collaboration across the businesses could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. As part of our business strategy, we have identified and continue to identify opportunities to improve profitability by reducing costs and enhancing productivity. Some of our ongoing initiatives focus on streamlining and automating back-office processes, capitalizing on ongoing synergies and identifying cost-savings while integrating new businesses. We have, for example, retained specialist IT services provider Mphasis to deliver tailored infrastructure services across various parts of The Ardonagh Group, and are in the process of transitioning to cloud-based data centers and a cloud-based core finance platform, which we believe will contribute to ongoing operating efficiencies across our businesses. Any operational efficiencies, cost-savings or optimization of middle- and back-office functions that we expect to realize from such efforts may differ materially from our estimates. In addition, any synergies, cost-savings or productivity enhancements that we realize may be offset, in whole or in part, by reductions in income or through increases in other expenses. We can provide no assurance that these initiatives will be completed as anticipated or that the benefits we expect will be achieved on a timely basis or at all. Our calculation of Total Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA includes adjustments for cost savings expected to be realized from these initiatives and cost savings in respect of companies that we have acquired or have committed to acquire. Although we believe these estimates and assumptions are reasonable, investors should not place undue reliance upon the calculation of Total Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA given how it is calculated and the possibility that the underlying estimates and assumptions may ultimately not reflect actual results.

We may also acquire noncontrolling stakes or enter into joint ventures with other players if we believe such transactions to be conducive to the achievement of our strategy. The success of our strategy is dependent upon our ability 53 ----- to identify suitable acquisition and disposal targets, conduct appropriate due diligence, negotiate transactions on favorable terms, obtain required authorizations and ultimately complete such transactions and integrate the acquired businesses into The Ardonagh Group or reorganize operations following a disposal. We cannot ensure that we will be able to identify attractive acquisition or disposal candidates or complete the acquisition or disposal of any identified candidates at favorable prices and upon advantageous terms. In order to pursue our acquisition strategy, we require financing and we may not have the financial resources necessary to consummate acquisitions or make the necessary investments in acquired businesses or have the ability to obtain the necessary funds on satisfactory terms. In addition to the initial cost of acquisitions, acquisition targets may require substantial capital expenditures to bring them up to our standards. General economic conditions or unfavorable global capital and credit markets could limit the number of financial institutions that are willing to provide financing to companies in our industry or affect the cost of such financing, which could affect the timing and extent to which we successfully acquire or dispose of such targets. Even if we are successful in acquiring target businesses, we may experience difficulties in integrating targets into our business, incur higher than expected costs or fail to realize the anticipated benefits or synergies. Attempting to integrate acquired companies may involve unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of our management’s attention or of our financial and other resources. In addition, the process of integrating acquisitions may also be disruptive to our operations, as a result of, among other things, unforeseen legal, regulatory, contractual (including, for instance, representations and warranties, indemnities, put and call options) and other issues, difficulties in realizing operating synergies, difficulties in integrating diverse business cultures which may be incompatible, problems in integrating IT or other systems between the businesses, disagreements with joint venture partners or minority shareholders or a failure to maintain the quality of services that we have historically provided. Such transactions may also disrupt our relationships with current and new employees, customers, capacity partners and industry colleagues. Our acquisitions may also subject us to more expansive or new regulatory frameworks, new customer segments with different habits than we have catered to and/or new competitive dynamics which could hinder our growth and frustrate the realization of our acquisition objectives. Although we always conduct due diligence investigations prior to each acquisition, we can provide no assurance that we will discover all operational deficiencies or material liabilities of an acquired business for which we may be responsible as a successor owner or operator and actual performance and developments may differ significantly from our expectations or forecasts. Our assessments of acquisition targets may prove to be incorrect, particularly our expectations with respect to growth, financial margins, cash flows and cost and revenue synergies. Additionally, acquisitions may require the approval of governmental or regulatory authorities which can block, impose conditions on or delay the acquisition process, resulting in a failure on our part to proceed with announced transactions on a timely basis or at all, thus hampering our opportunities for growth. We believe that our corporate culture, including our management philosophy, has been a critical component to our success and that our culture creates an environment that drives and perpetuates our overall business strategy. We have invested substantial time and resources in building our team and we expect to continue to hire as we expand in both the United Kingdom and internationally. As we grow and mature and grow internationally, we may find it difficult to maintain our corporate culture. Any failure to preserve our culture could negatively affect our future success, including our ability to recruit and retain personnel and effectively focus on and pursue our business strategy. Any acquisition or other strategic transaction we may undertake in the future could result in the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities, an increase in interest expenses and amortisation expenses related to goodwill or other intangible assets or in the use by us of available cash on hand to finance any such acquisitions. In identifying acquisition targets we may incorrectly assess the market position, 54 ----- growth prospects or underwriting performance of the target business, or whether the business’ geographic, distribution channel or product mix fits within our existing operations. We may incorrectly assess the commission and fee income streams of the target business, as well as the potential to increase such streams following the acquisition, upon which the price paid for acquisitions is primarily based. Although we conduct due diligence with respect to the business and operations of acquired businesses, we may fail to identify all material facts concerning these businesses. Unanticipated events or liabilities relating to these businesses could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow. Such failures to achieve our acquisition target performance goals and could in turn have material adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

While the parties to the Retail SPA have obligations in relation to the satisfaction of the conditions under the Retail SPA, there can be no assurance that all of the conditions will be satisfied or waived (as applicable) by the Retail SPA Long Stop Date unless extended. The Retail SPA contains covenants and agreements applicable to the Retail Group prior to completion of the Retail Transaction. Any failure on the part of the Retail Seller to comply with any of its obligations under the Retail SPA could result in the completion of the Retail Transaction being delayed or not taking place at all. Moreover, while the Retail Purchaser has demonstrated it has funds available to finance the cash consideration under the Retail SPA, in the event that the Retail Purchaser does not have sufficient funding to satisfy the cash consideration at completion, completion of the Retail Transaction may not proceed even if all conditions under the Retail SPA have been satisfied or waived and there can be no assurance that we would be able to recover any losses as a result thereof. Therefore, Retail Transaction may be delayed or may not complete at all. If the Retail Transaction does not proceed to completion, we will not receive the expected proceeds from the Retail Transaction and there is no guarantee that we would be able to enter into any other transaction on favorable terms or at all.

1923_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Business and Industry,13.1.6,The entry into new geographies and markets exposes us to risks.,"Our expansion and growth may, from time to time, lead us to start operating in geographies or markets where we currently have little or no presence to increase the size and geographic scope of our operations or to pursue growth and/or other opportunities. We have in recent years strengthened our international operations and global reach and have entered into new markets such as Australia, the Netherlands, Portugal, Brazil, Greece, and Switzerland. We have a robust M&A pipeline (85% of which consists of 55 ----- targets outside of the United Kingdom), and we continue to explore larger transaction opportunities globally with a strong focus on market-leading platforms. Our expansion may introduce dependencies on new market conditions in new geographical locations. A broader geographical distribution of our business portfolio may also result in additional costs in connection with the management of our businesses and reduce the benefits of economies of scale. The occurrence of any of the foregoing factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our entry into new geographies and markets may entail numerous risks, including: - changes in laws and regulations with a significant impact on our business, our products and our operations; - competition with established competitors in new markets, who may have greater knowledge of those markets and/or resources to expend in those markets than we do; - difficulties in understanding and adapting to local cultural norms, including, but not limited to, consumption patterns, seasonal effects, consumer trends and preferences, as well seasonal effects; - diversion of management’s attention and difficulties in staffing and managing global operations and the increased travel, infrastructure, and legal compliance costs; - certain other risks involved in entering markets in which we have limited or no prior experience; and - reputational and other risks regarding our ability to enter new geographies or markets successfully, including obtaining financing which could result in an increase in our indebtedness. We have also recently entered the reinsurance market. In 2021, we launched Inver Re, a new reinsurance broker. As a new player in the reinsurance market, we may face strong competition from established players. In addition, the lack of strong barriers to entry into the reinsurance business means that we may compete with new companies that may be formed to enter the insurance and reinsurance markets. We may also experience increased competition as a result of the consolidation in the reinsurance industry. Competition in the types of reinsurance that we underwrite is based on many factors, including the perceived and relative financial strength, pricing and other terms and conditions, services provided, ratings assigned by independent rating agencies, speed of claims payment, geographic scope of business, reputation and experience in the lines of business to be written. If competitive pressures reduce our prices, we would expect to write less business. In addition, competition for customers would become more intense and we could incur additional expenses relating to customer acquisition and retention, further reducing our operating margins. Furthermore, insurance-linked securities, derivatives and other non-traditional risk transfer mechanisms and alternative vehicles are being developed and offered by other parties, which could impact the demand for traditional insurance or reinsurance. A number of new, proposed or potential industry or legislative developments could further increase competition in the reinsurance industry. New competition from these developments could cause the demand for reinsurance to fall or the expense of customer acquisition and retention to increase, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our growth and profitability. As a result of new and alternative capital inflows into the industry and cedants retaining more business, there is an excess supply of reinsurance capital which is also driving pricing lower and putting pressure on terms and conditions. See also “—Competition in our industry is intense, and if we are unable to compete effectively, our _business may be adversely affected.”_ 56 ----- Any failure to successfully enter new geographies or markets could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We can provide no assurance that our IT infrastructure and software systems, or the IT infrastructure of our third-party service providers will not be disrupted or interrupted. An interruption to or loss of our information processing capabilities through the loss of stored data, a failure of our computer equipment or software or telecommunications systems or some other technology disruption could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Disruptions may include terrorist activities, disease pandemics, war or military activity, or disruption to the electrical, communications or other services used by our company, our employees or third parties with whom we conduct business. While we have developed a disaster recovery plan for our IT services as well as our cloud-based IT data center, there can be no assurance that in the event of a disaster our systems will be fully effective. We rely on (“PCWs”) to distribute certain of our products and are as such exposed to interruptions to the processing systems in the services provided by PCWs. We are also dependent on certain third parties to enable us to complete transactions relating to the pricing and placement of insurance products. A significant failure of any of our platforms or any of these third parties could have a negative impact on our ability to service our customer and complete transactions, could have a material adverse impact on our financial control frameworks and our ability to carry out our internal financial processes. Our computer systems store information about our customers, some of which is sensitive personal data. Database privacy, identity theft and related computer and internet issues are matters of growing public concern and are subject to changes in rules and regulations. Any failure to adhere to or successfully implement processes in response to changing regulatory requirements in this area could result in legal liability or harm to our reputation. Unauthorized data disclosure could occur through cyber security breaches, as a result of human error, external hacking, malware infection, malicious or accidental user activity, internal security breaches and physical security breaches, among others, and we are exposed to increased risk of data compromise when our employees work from home due to such employees being outside the office environment and are unable to be supervised in person. Some of our businesses have in the past had weak cyber security controls. In particular, with the growing incidence of hacking and other forms of cyberattacks, our IT systems and networks have been, and may in the future be, subject to malicious attacks, including cyber-attacks or the deliberate, accidental or negligent insertion 57 ----- of software viruses or other malicious code, any of which may disrupt or interrupt their normal operation, prevent access to data, cause data loss or corruption, result in the unauthorized distribution of data, including customer or employee data, damage or destroy some or all of our systems or cause unexpected shutdowns. We may be from time to time subject to, and our business may be vulnerable to, cybercrime attacks, such as attempts to gain unauthorized access to, or deliberately breach, our IT systems and networks in order, for example, to manipulate our proprietary business data or customer information, theft of data, and even incidents that do not amount to a breach could result in adverse regulatory and financial consequences including breaches of the Data Protection Act 2018 and the General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”), as well as further regulatory intervention, and could harm our reputation. Such attacks are technologically sophisticated and may be difficult or impossible to detect and defend against. Despite the security measures that we have implemented to prevent unauthorized access to information stored in our database and to comply with relevant data protection regulations, our technology may fail to adequately protect the private information we maintain in our databases from theft or inadvertent leakage. In addition, the transition of our employees to working from home increases data compromise risk due to such employees being outside the office environment and are unable to be supervised in-person.

For example, Total Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Pro Forma for Q4 2023 Growth and Transactions and Total Pro Forma Income and Total Income Pro Forma for Q4 2023 Growth and Transactions include adjustments for transactions that either have not closed or have not signed. As a result, we may never acquire or integrate these targets in our business and may never receive the contribution from such acquisitions or transactions. Total Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Total Pro Forma Income includes estimated future contribution to our Adjusted EBITDA and Total Income which may not materialize within the expected time or at all. As a result, these metrics have inherent limitations and may not give an accurate or complete picture of the financial condition or results of operations of any entities prior to their acquisition by us, may not 60 ----- give an accurate or complete indication of our current or future results of operations or may not be comparable to our consolidated financial statements or the other financial information included in this offering memorandum and should not be relied upon when making an investment decision. See “—Our _selective acquisition and disposal strategy exposes us to risks, including the risk that we may not be able to successfully integrate acquired businesses or that acquisitions may have liabilities that we are not aware of and may not be as profitable as we may have expected them to be and that disposals may not have the impact on results of operations that we expected them to have.” These assumptions and_ management estimates may depend on a number of circumstances that are outside our control or may not materialize in line with our expectations.",N/A,as_expected,2024,879

As of September 30, 2023, the book value of our goodwill amounted to £3,876.9 million while our total intangible assets amounted to £5,305.7 million. In accordance with IFRS, we annually test whether goodwill and other assets with indefinite useful lives have suffered any impairment. Other assets are also reviewed for impairments whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount of an asset or a cash generating unit is determined based on the higher of fair value less costs to sell and a value in use calculation based on management’s assumptions and estimates. Our last impairment review on September 30, 2023 resulted in no impairment charge. A decrease in expected cash flows of the group of cash generating units, changes in market conditions, loss of key customers and a change in our imputed cost of capital may indicate potential impairment of recorded goodwill. Weakness in the global economy also may cause us to make impairment charges, which, depending on the amounts impaired, could have a material adverse effect on results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2024,879

In respect of our MGA and broking divisions, numerous other firms, as well as insurance companies that directly solicit customers without the assistance of an agent or broker, compete for a share of the various insurance markets and customers. Furthermore, aggressive pricing by competitors in the underwriting industry could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

Our insurance intermediary activities must comply with FCA rules which impose minimum “threshold conditions” that must be satisfied as well as robust standards for the establishment and maintenance of proper systems and controls, notably for the conduct of business and the fair treatment of customers and the protection of fiduciary funds (i.e. client monies). The FCA Rules also impose upon us certain minimum capital and liquidity requirements. Our conduct obligations require us to demonstrate that we are consistently delivering fair outcomes to consumers and that senior management are taking responsibility for ensuring that we, and our staff at all levels, deliver the consumer outcomes relevant to our business by establishing an appropriate culture. Situations can arise in which our interests differ from those of customers or in which we represent two customers who are both parties to the same insurance claim. The FCA Rules oblige us to proactively identify and manage conflicts of interest fairly and we risk regulatory action if we do not do so. Additionally, future changes in laws and regulations relating to our business, as well as any future regulatory intervention with respect to our business or the industry more generally, could limit activities in the future and result in increased costs of regulatory compliance and increased management attention being required to be dedicated to compliance. This could consequently adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Firms have an ongoing obligation to periodically provide the FCA with certain information, including on their financial performance and customer outcomes. The FCA supervises firms’ activities to assess compliance with regulatory requirements, including client money rules. The FCA will seek additional information from firms via surveys, thematic reviews and formal risk assessments. The FCA has extensive investigative and disciplinary powers, including the power to impose fines and vary or cancel regulatory permissions. While we maintain an ongoing dialogue with the FCA in the ordinary course of business and while we consider our compliance with the FCA Rules to be robust, failure to comply with the FCA Rules could lead to disciplinary action, including requiring customers to be compensated for loss, the imposition of penalties and the revocation or variation of our authorizations to conduct business, in whole or in part. In addition, individuals performing various controlled ‘Senior Management’ functions in accordance with the Senior Managers & Certification Regime (“SMCR”) for regulated firms are required to be approved by the FCA and to satisfy certain fitness and propriety criteria. The SMCR requires a number of approved person to be in charge of a certain range of activities within our business, including finance, audit and risk. Any disciplinary or enforcement action against these individuals by the FCA could prevent such persons from continuing to work for us. As a number of these individuals are key personnel, this could have a material adverse effect on our business. Disciplinary or enforcement action against any individuals or against the business generally could result in damage to our brands and reputation. As such, any future material incidents of non-compliance within The Ardonagh Group and any business that we are acquiring could result in enhanced sanctions, fines, penalties or other disciplinary actions, 62 ----- including, among other things, limitations or prohibitions on our future business activities, which could consequently materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Although we conduct due diligence with respect to the business and operations of acquired businesses, we may fail to identify all material facts concerning these businesses. Unanticipated events or liabilities relating to acquired businesses could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow. Conducting our business in an ethically acceptable manner is important to our reputation, status with regulators and business prospects. Although we have adopted and maintain a “Code of Ethics” that includes provisions addressing compliance with best practices, we have recently been subject to fraudulent behavior by employees in connection with the embezzlement of both our and certain customer funds. Any such instances (including our failure to adequately implement monitoring systems) may expose us to liabilities, as well as to reputational damage as a result of such occurrences.",N/A,as_expected,2024,879

Recent events, including the discovery of monitoring activities by certain governmental agencies, have resulted in a heightened legislative and regulatory focus on privacy, data protection and information security around the world and, in particular, across Europe. Legislators and regulators in the EEA have adopted and are introducing further privacy, data protection and information security laws, regulation and guidance that could potentially have a significant and adverse impact on our current and planned privacy, data protection and information security-related practices, our collection, use, sharing, retention and safeguarding of consumer and/or employee personal data and some of our current or planned business activities. In particular, and in addition to incurring compliance costs, changes to such laws, regulations and guidance may create significant business interruption risks if we are no longer able to use customer data in the manner in which we have been accustomed. Our ability to obtain, retain, process and otherwise manage the personal data of our customers is governed by data protection laws and regulations, including the GDPR, which came into effect on May 25, 2018 (including as implemented into the laws of the UK) and the Data Protection Act 2018, as well as the regulatory rules and guidance issued by, among others, the UK Information Commissioner’s Office These data protection laws provide individuals with a number of rights (data subjects), impose strict controls over the processing of personal data by both controllers and processors of personal data and impose strict sanctions with substantial administrative fines and potential claims for damages from data subjects for breach of their rights. Should a serious data breach occur, the GDPR sets out potentially onerous obligations to notify regulators and data subjects whose personal data has been compromised and may result in the imposition of significant sanctions and penalties, which will require heightened escalation and notification processes with associated response plans. If a significant or widely publicized incident, such as an unlawful disclosure of employee or customer data were to occur, whether as a result of a cyber-attack, the failure of our IT security systems, employee negligence or the actions of our vendors, we may be subject to legal claims by individuals (including in the form of group litigation) and counterparties, fines and/or other enforcement action which could result in adverse regulatory and financial consequences and could harm our reputation. Our EEA, UK and Swiss businesses may also be subject to evolving data protection laws on personal data export as they may transfer personal data from the EEA, UK and Switzerland to other jurisdictions. For example, in 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union (“CJEU”) invalidated the EU-US Privacy Shield framework regarding the transfer of personal data from the European Union to the United States in its landmark decision Schrems II. While the EU-US Privacy Shield was subsequently replaced in July 2023 by the EU-US Data Privacy Framework, the CJEU placed additional conditions on the use 63 ----- of the main alternative mechanism for adequate data export, i.e., the standard contractual clauses, which requires the exporting entity to assess the laws of the importing entity and determine whether additional safeguards need to be applied to protect the personal data. Data export continues to be a contentious issue and there may be future challenges and requirements. We rely on a mixture of mechanisms to transfer data from our EEA, UK and Swiss business to India as part of our Mphasis outsourcing contract and could be impacted by changes in law, regulation or guidance as a result of the current climate. Current European laws that cover online marketing by email or other electronic communications such as SMS or cookies are under reform and may change in due course. A draft new law, i.e., the ePrivacy Regulation, was announced on January 10, 2017 and has been discussed at length within the EU Council, although discussions have currently stalled and it is unclear whether or when it will eventually come into force. Unlike the current marketing rules across the European Union, this ePrivacy Regulation will directly be implemented into the laws of each of the European Union Member States without the need for further enactment (although certain local deviations are contemplated in some areas). The current draft extends the strict opt-in marketing rules to business-to-business communications, strengthens requirements around other online marketing tools, and significantly increases penalties to the same level of fines as the GDPR. The UK is unlikely to implement equivalent regulation, but the UK’s Data Protection and Digital Information Bill (No.2), which is still being debated in the House of Lords, looks likely to make changes to the current UK ePrivacy regime. These changes may make the requirements around cookies in the UK less onerous. Further regulatory developments in the EEA, UK and Switzerland may impact our current online marketing strategies and revising these strategies may result in additional compliance costs. Furthermore, industry developments driven by privacy considerations may also impact our current online marketing strategies, including changes to ability to use third-party cookies. We are also subject to the terms of our privacy policies and privacy-related obligations to third parties. We strive to comply with all applicable laws, policies and legal obligations, decisions and opinions of relevant local authorities relating to privacy and data protection in the jurisdictions in which we operate as well as our other privacy-related obligations. These laws and regulations are subject to revision and differing interpretations and have generally become more stringent over time. We cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which we might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted. It also is possible that these obligations may not be applied consistently by regulatory authorities or across courts. These privacy and data protectionrelated laws, regulations and guidance are evolving with new or modified laws and regulations proposed and implemented frequently and existing laws, regulations and guidance subject to new or different interpretations. Compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly and disruptive to the operation of our business. Although we believe we have implemented appropriate controls to meet these regulatory obligations, we cannot assure you that our controls will always be foolproof. Our past compliance history may be factored into any matters that come to a regulator’s attention in the future, including any apparent violations. If our systems and controls are found to be insufficient, we may be exposed to heightened sanctions, financial crime and/or fraud risk and the relevant business, its directors and certain members of staff could face criminal sanctions, regulatory censure or financial penalties. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with such obligations or with our own privacy policies, or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized processing, release or transfer of information, may result in governmental enforcement actions, litigation or public statements against us by consumer advocacy groups or others and could cause our customers and the third parties with whom we work to lose trust in us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Additionally, if the third parties with whom we work violate either applicable laws or our own policies, such violations may put the information in our database at risk and could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business. Furthermore, compliance with current and/or new laws and regulations could result in the incurrence of additional compliance costs and, under certain circumstances, could require changes in the way we conduct our business, which, in each case, may adversely impact our business and results of operations. 64 -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,879

As an insurance broker, we are regulated by local regulated authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate, and subject to compliance risk in connection with our operations abroad. We are also subject to laws regarding money laundering, financing of terrorism and laws prohibiting us, our employees or intermediaries from making improper payments or offers of payment to foreign governments and their officials and political parties for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, including the UK’s Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 and Bribery Act 2010 (including The Fourth European Union Anti-Money Laundering Directive implemented in the United Kingdom by the Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Transfer of Funds (Information on the Payer) Regulations 2017, which impose additional requirements with respect to determining beneficial ownership and identifying politically exposed persons). From January 10, 2020, we have also been subject to the Fifth European Union Anti Money Laundering Directive, which was transposed by the United Kingdom via the Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing (Amendment) Regulations 2019. The Fifth European Union Anti Money Laundering Directive makes a number of key amendments to the Fourth European Union Anti Money Laundering Directive, among them: (i) requiring firms to apply customer due diligence measures to existing customers where they have any legal duty in a year to contact the customer for the purposes of 65 ----- reviewing any information which relates to the beneficial ownership of the customer, or when an existing customer must be contacted in order to fulfil any duty under the International Tax Compliance Regulations 2015; and (ii) requiring firms, when entering into a new business relationship with a company or trust that is subject to the beneficial ownership registration requirements under the Fourth European Union Anti Money Laundering Directive, to collect either proof of registration on the register or an extract of the register. We also may be subject to sanctions administered by the United States Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”), the United Nations Security Council, the European Union, the UK Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation, the UK National Crime Agency, or other relevant sanctions authorities. As a result of our international reach, we may provide insurance intermediaries services to clients in a jurisdiction subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny. Failure to comply with any local laws could result in investigations, public censure, financial penalties, liability and/or enforcement actions being brought against us. Damage to our reputation, whether because of a failure to comply with applicable laws or any regulatory action, could deter customers from choosing us.

International economic and trade sanctions are complex and subject to frequent change, including in relation to jurisdictional reach and to the list of countries, entities, products and individuals subject to sanctions. Countries or defined regional territories may also become the subject of sanctions, for example the Crimea region of Ukraine, resulting in stringent requirements for trade with such countries or territories. In providing our services, we must comply with applicable sanctions, including laws, rules and regulations relating to the conduct of business, trade sanction laws administered by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control, the E.U., the U.K. and the United Nations (“U.N.”), and the requirements of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act as well as other anti-bribery and corruption rules and requirements. In the past year, there has been an increase in U.S. designations in relation to Russia and China (including recent sanctions imposed on Russia by the United States as well as the E.U. and U.K. due to Ukraine), and there has also been an increased risk of counter-sanctions in some locations, such as China and Russia in response to the recently imposed sanctions. We have also seen a maturing of the U.K. sanctions regime, which has navigated a differing path from the E.U. and U.S. sanctions regimes but largely with the same objectives. A number of volatile geopolitical events are likely to affect the implementation of sanctions such as the change of regime in Afghanistan, the escalation of sanctions towards Belarus, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the uncertainty around the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, negotiations between the E.U., United States and Iran over a new nuclear deal as well as the continuing trade war between the United States and China with their sanctions and subsequent counter-sanctions. Such events could impact our ability to expand our business in the future. As a result, we cannot predict the impacts of any changes in the United States, E.U., U.K. or other sanctions, and whether such changes could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and result of operations. 66 ----- Ensuring compliance with such controls and regulations may be difficult or costly and there is a risk that we could become subject to investigations or claims by authorities. The complexity of maintaining oversight over the operations of certain third party contractors may expose us to risks of inadvertent, indirect or secondary violations of applicable sanctions laws. Sanctions laws are regularly evolving and while we have policies and procedures in place to ensure we only place policies in compliance with applicable sanctions laws, a policy may subsequently become impermissible, and we may have to react quickly to ensure our ongoing compliance. If we fail to comply with sanctions, we and our employees could be subject to civil or criminal penalties, including monetary penalties, and, in extreme cases, imprisonment of responsible employees for violations of these laws. We may also be adversely affected through penalties, reputational harm, loss of access to certain markets, or otherwise. Changes in sanctions and other trade restrictions may delay the introduction and sale of our services in certain markets and prevent our customers with international operations from using our services. Any change in trade regulations, sanctions or related laws, shift in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations, or change in the countries, governments, persons or technologies targeted by such regulations, could result in decreased use of our services, or in our decreased ability to export or sell our services to existing or potential customers with international operations.

Changes in legislation or regulations and actions by regulators, including changes in administration and enforcement policies, could from time to time require operational improvements or modifications, the conduct of reviews and audits or the cessation of certain business practices, product lines or income streams that could result in higher costs or restrict our ability to operate our business and, as a result, have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. HMRC may also take enforcement actions against us which may result in fines, penalties and/or interest charges being imposed on us which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, we are currently in process of assessing the impact of Pillar Two, which introduces a global minimum effective tax rate for certain multinational groups with consolidated revenues over a certain amount and becomes effective this year. If we conclude that Pillar Two has a significant impact, it could have a negative impact on our financial position and cash flow. Our business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected by the outcome of certain actual and potential claims, lawsuits and other proceedings. We are subject to various actual and potential claims, lawsuits and proceedings relating principally to alleged errors, omissions or unfair provisions in connection with the placement of insurance or the provision of financial services advice in the ordinary course of business. As we often assist our customers with matters involving substantial amounts of money, including the provision of financial services advice and the placement of insurance coverage and handling of related claims, errors and omissions claims against us may arise that allege potential liability for all or part of the amounts in question. Claimants can seek large damage awards and these claims can involve potentially significant defense costs. Such claims, lawsuits and other proceedings could, for example, allege damages as a result of our employees, agents or sub-agents improperly: - failing to place coverage on behalf of customers; - failing to inform clients of relevant warranties and exclusions applying to their policies; 67 ----- - failing to adequately advise customers of their duties of disclosure and the risk of underinsurance; and - failing to provide insurance companies with complete and accurate information relating to the risks being insured or to appropriately apply funds that we hold for our customers on a fiduciary basis. Our MGA segment assesses risk and issues policies to customers on behalf of insurance companies. In writing an insurance policy, we agree to a set of underwriting criteria with an insurance company and write the policy under delegated authority from the insurance company. If we underwrite a greater risk than agreed by the insurance company, handle a claim in excess of any cap without referring such claim to the insurance company, issue policies that are outside of the applicable eligible business criteria, use staff who are not authorized under the relevant delegated authority agreement or otherwise act beyond the scope of our delegated authority, the insurance company may refuse to provide the funds in respect of the insurance claim in question. As a result, we would incur the liability for such claims, which could have a negative effect on our reputation, financial position and cash flow. We maintain professional indemnity insurance for errors and omissions claims, the terms of which vary by policy year. Our ability to obtain such professional indemnity insurance in the future in the amounts and with the deductibles we desire may be adversely impacted by general developments in the market for such insurance or by our own claims experience. We cannot guarantee that in the future we will be able to renew our current insurance policies on favorable terms, if at all. In recent years, our self-insured risks in our Advisory platform and MGAs have increased. In respect of such risks, we have established a provision for claims in respect of outstanding errors and omissions claims that we believe to be adequate in light of current information and legal advice; we adjust this provision from time to time according to relevant developments. If such insurance coverage proves inadequate or unavailable or if there is an increase in liabilities for which we self-insure, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected. We may also incur liabilities for the actions of our directors, employees, agents and representatives related to our business, including in relation to financial crime and fraudulent activities, which may expose us to liability for claims and proceedings that could have a negative effect on our reputation, financial position and cash flow. In addition, our reputation and operations may be adversely affected by contractual or other proceedings instituted by third-party service providers, suppliers or competitors. Our reputation and operations may also be adversely affected by failures in claims management. Instances of failing to notify insurers of claims on behalf of customers, of inaccurate or incomplete cash reserves, poor service quality or excessive claims handling costs may result in claims, lawsuits or other proceedings as well as damage to our reputation. Our brands and reputation may be negatively affected if customers seek redress publicly, through the courts or otherwise.

Ongoing liquidity challenges may have an adverse impact on business value and earning capacity.,"Our ability to obtain liquidity is essential to our capacity to meet both anticipated and unanticipated financial obligations in a manner that does not prejudice our day-to-day operations. Liquidity risk refers to any inability on our part to meet payment obligations. It arises where, for internal reasons (such as a specific major issue) or external reasons (such as macroeconomic conditions), we face a sudden reduction in available liquidity, or a sudden need to increase funding. For example, future exceptional payments or a negative result in a material dispute could result in our experiencing shortfalls of cash. Moreover, the incurrence of additional debt could lead to a downgrade by rating agencies which could in turn result in revenue or cash pressure through competitors using the information to discredit the business among customers and staff, insurers increasing pressure on payment and collections processes as a means of managing their risk and staff becoming unsettled as a result of adverse publicity. If market conditions were adverse for an extended period, if there were a general economic downturn, if our credit standing were to decline or if we were unable to access the market to meet our liquidity requirements, such factors individually or in the aggregate could have a material adverse effect upon our cash flow, business, results of operations, and financial condition.

The Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement provides for the New Term Facilities and the CAR Facility, each of which matures in 2031, and the Revolving Credit Facility, which matures on January 14, 2029. See “Description of Other Indebtedness and Financing Arrangements—Senior Secured _Credit Facilities Agreement.” The Senior Secured Notes mature in 2031 and the Senior Notes mature_ in 2032. At the respective maturity dates of the Secured Credit Facilities, the Notes, or any other debt which we may incur, if we do not have sufficient cash flows from operations and other capital resources to pay our debt obligations, or to fund our other liquidity needs, we may be required to refinance or restructure our indebtedness. If we are unable to refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness or obtain such refinancing or restructuring on terms acceptable to us, we may be forced to 70 ----- sell assets, or raise additional debt or equity financing in amounts that could be substantial or the holders of our debt may accelerate our debt and, to the extent such debt is secured, foreclose on our assets.

We cannot assure you that we will be able to accomplish any of these measures in a timely manner or on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. In such an event, we may not have sufficient cash or sources of cash to repay all of our debt.

These interest rates could rise significantly in the future, thereby increasing our interest expenses associated with these obligations, reducing cash flow available for capital expenditures and hindering our ability to make payments on the Notes. The material increases in global inflation since early 2022, reaching double-digit levels not seen since the 1980s, and the risk that annual inflation may remain high for a long period of time (driven at least in part by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the resulting impact on energy markets) has forced central banks of the major world economies, including the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, to significantly increase certain interest rates in a very short timeframe, ending the lengthy period of low interest rates. This has resulted in increases in base rates such as SOFR, CDOR, Daily Compounded SONIA or EURIBOR, on which our floating rate instruments are calculated, including the Existing Senior Secured Credit Facilities, which has significantly and adversely affected our financing costs. The interest rates under our floating rate financing arrangements could continue to rise significantly in the future, increasing our interest expense associated with these obligations, reducing cash flow available for capital expenditures, and hindering our ability to make cash payments on the Notes. Although we may enter into and maintain certain hedging arrangements designed to fix a portion of these rates, there can be no assurance that hedging will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms. Hedging itself carries certain risks, including that we may need to pay a significant amount, including costs, to unwind any hedging arrangements.

We are highly leveraged and expect to continue to be highly leveraged following the Offering. As of September 30, 2023, as adjusted to give effect to the Transactions, we would have total financial indebtedness of £3,749 million (equivalent). See “Capitalization.” The degree to which we are and continue to be leveraged following the issuance of the Notes could have important consequences to holders of the Notes, including, but not limited to: - making it difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness; - making us vulnerable to, and reducing our flexibility to respond to, general adverse economic and industry conditions; - requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal of, and interest on, indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of such cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, joint ventures, or other general corporate purposes; - limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the competitive environment and the industry in which we operate; - placing us at a competitive disadvantage as compared to our competitors, to the extent that they are not as highly leveraged; and - limiting our ability to borrow additional funds and increasing the cost of any such borrowing. Any of these or other consequences or events could have a material adverse effect on our ability to satisfy our debt obligations, including the Notes. Despite our substantial leverage, we may still be able to incur more debt under the Indenture governing the Notes, which could further exacerbate the risk described above.

A breach of any of those covenants, including our failure to comply with the financial ratios under the Revolving Credit Facility, or the occurrence of certain specified events will, subject to applicable cure periods and other limitations, result in an event of default under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement. In particular, upon the occurrence of any event of default under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement, the Majority Lenders (being, subject to certain limitations, lenders of the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities whose commitments thereunder aggregate at least 66⅔% of the total commitments thereunder) could (among other remedies) cancel the availability of the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities and elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities, together with accrued interest, immediately due and payable.

Payment of interest and repayment of our indebtedness, including under the Notes, will be wholly dependent on the ability of the Company to make such cash available to the Issuer, through interest payments under the Proceeds Loan or other payments. We intend to provide funds to the Company in order to meet the obligations on the Notes through a combination of dividends and interest payments on intercompany loans. If our subsidiaries do not fulfil their obligations under the intercompany loans and do not distribute cash to the Company in sufficient time to allow the Issuer to make scheduled payments on the Notes, the Issuer will not have any other source of funds that would allow it to make such payments. Cash and cash equivalents held by our regulated entities can only be extracted and upstreamed to their direct or indirect parent entities, including for purposes of debt service or, in the case of such entities that are Guarantors, in the event of an enforcement on such entity’s Note Guarantee, to the extent that such regulated entities has sufficient cumulative distributable reserves and that the minimum capital requirements continue to be met. See “Description of the Notes—The Note Guarantees—General.” Agreements governing our debt (including the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement) may also restrict and, in some cases may prohibit, the ability of these subsidiaries to move cash within their restricted group. In particular, the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement restricts the ability of the Issuer’s subsidiaries from paying cash interest on the Senior Notes while an event of default thereunder is continuing. Applicable tax laws may also subject such payments to further taxation and applicable corporate law may limit the amounts that some of our subsidiaries will be permitted to pay as dividends or distributions on their equity interests, or even prevent such payments. In particular, our ability to pay dividends to the Issuer will generally be limited to the amount of distributable reserves available to us. Distributions by certain of our subsidiaries will also be subject to pro rata distributions to minority interests. See “Summary—Summary Corporate and Financing Structure.” In addition, minority shareholders have interests in certain of our subsidiaries and may receive certain distributions ahead of distributions made to holders of the Notes. From time to time, we have bought out and we may continue to buy out minority interests as and when market opportunities are aligned with our business strategy. The inability to transfer cash among entities within their respective consolidated groups may mean that, even though the entities, in aggregate, may have sufficient resources to meet their obligations, they may not be permitted to make the necessary transfers from one entity in their restricted group to another entity in their restricted group in order to make payments to the entity owing the obligations. The subsidiaries of the Company that do not guarantee the Notes have no obligation to make payments with respect to any of the Notes.

The value of the assets underlying the Collateral will also depend on many factors, including, among other things, whether or not the business is sold as a going concern, regulatory restrictions that could affect such sale, the ability to sell the assets in an orderly sale and the condition of the economies in which operations are located and the availability of buyers. The Collateral that is pledged or assigned for the benefit of the holders of the Notes may provide for only limited repayment of the Notes, in part because most of such Collateral may not be liquid and its value to other parties may be less than their value to us. Likewise, we cannot assure you that the Collateral will be saleable or, if saleable, that there will not be substantial delays in the liquidation thereof. Furthermore, enforcement of the Collateral and any transfer of our operations may require, in certain jurisdictions, governmental or other regulatory consents, approvals or filings or might otherwise be challenged. Such consents, approvals or filings may take time to obtain or may not be obtained at all. As a result, enforcement may be delayed, a temporary shutdown of operations may occur and the value of the Collateral may be significantly decreased. Most of our assets do not secure the Notes and it is possible that the value of the Notes Collateral will not be sufficient to cover the amount of indebtedness secured by the Notes Collateral. With respect to the shares that will be pledged to secure the Notes and the Note Guarantees thereof, such shares may also have limited value in the event of bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar proceedings in relation to the entity’s shares that have been pledged because all of the obligations of the entity whose shares have been pledged must first be satisfied, leaving little or no remaining assets in the pledged entity. As a result, the creditors may not recover anything of value in the case of an enforcement sale. In addition, the value of the Collateral may decline over time. To the extent the claims of the holders of the Notes exceed the value of the Collateral securing the Notes and the Note Guarantees, those claims will generally rank equally with the claims of the holders of all other existing and future senior unsecured debt ranking _pari passu with the Notes and the Note 78 ----- Guarantees. As a result, if the value of the assets pledged as Collateral is less than the value of the claims of the holders of the Notes, those claims may not be satisfied in full. In addition, not all of our assets will secure the Notes, and the Indentures will allow the Company and its restricted subsidiaries (in the case of the Senior Secured Indenture) or the Parent and its restricted subsidiaries (in the case of the Senior Indenture)) to secure certain types of debt permitted to be incurred under the Indentures (which may be structurally senior to the Notes and the Note Guarantees) with the property and assets of the restricted subsidiaries that do not secure the Notes. The value of such assets and property could be significant. If an event of default occurs and the obligations under the Notes are accelerated, the Notes and the Note Guarantees will not benefit from the assets securing such secured debt and will rank equally with the holders of other unsecured debt of the Company and its restricted subsidiaries (in the case of the Senior Secured Indenture) or the Parent and its restricted subsidiaries (in the case of the Senior Indenture)) with respect to any property or assets that is excluded from the Collateral securing the Notes or such secured debt.",N/A,as_expected,2024,879

The insolvency laws of certain jurisdictions may not be as favorable to your interests as the laws of the United States or other jurisdictions with which you are familiar. In the event that any one or more of the Issuers, the Guarantors or any other of the Parent’s subsidiaries experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. Although laws differ among the jurisdictions, in general, applicable fraudulent transfer and conveyance and equitable principles, insolvency laws and limitations on the enforceability of judgments obtained in courts in such jurisdictions could limit the enforceability of the Notes against the relevant Issuer, the enforceability of a Note Guarantee against a Guarantor and the enforceability of the security interests in the Collateral. In certain circumstances the court may also void the security interest in the Collateral or the Note Guarantees if the company is close to or near insolvency. The following discussion of fraudulent transfer, conveyance and insolvency law, although an overview, describes generally applicable terms and principles, which are defined under the relevant jurisdiction’s fraudulent transfer and insolvency statutes. In an insolvency proceeding, it is possible that creditors of the Guarantors or the appointed insolvency administrator may challenge the guarantees and the security interests in the Collateral and intercompany obligations generally, as preferences, transaction at an undervalue, invalid charges, fraudulent transfers or conveyances or on other grounds. If so, such laws may permit a court, if it makes certain findings, to: - avoid or invalidate all or a portion of a Guarantor’s obligations under its Note Guarantee or the security interests provided by such security provider; - direct that the relevant Issuer and the holders of the Notes return any amounts paid under a Note Guarantee or any security interest in the Collateral to the relevant Guarantor or security provider or to a fund for the benefit of the Guarantor’s or security provider’s creditors; and 83 ----- - take other action that is detrimental to you. If we cannot satisfy our obligations under the Notes and any Note Guarantee or security interest in the Collateral is found to be a preference, transaction at an undervalue, fraudulent transfer or conveyance or is otherwise set aside, we cannot assure you that we can ever repay in full any amounts outstanding under the Notes. In addition, the liability of each Guarantor or security provider under its Note Guarantee or the security interests in the Collateral is limited to the amount that will result in such guarantee or Security Interests not constituting a fraudulent conveyance or improper corporate distribution or otherwise being set aside. The amount recoverable from the Guarantors and security providers under the Security Documents is also limited. However, there can be no assurance as to what standard a court would apply in making a determination of the maximum liability of each. There is also the possibility that the entire Note Guarantee or security interest may be set aside, in which case the entire liability may be extinguished. See also “—Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws, capital _maintenance and other limitations on the Note Guarantees and the Collateral may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Collateral.”_ In order to initiate any of these actions under fraudulent transfer or other applicable principles, courts would, for example, need to find that, at the time the Note Guarantees were issued or the security interests in the Collateral created and in case such transaction occurred within a specific time period before the opening of insolvency proceedings, the Notes Guarantor or security provider: - issued such Note Guarantee or created such security interest with the intent of hindering, delaying or defrauding current or future creditors or with a desire to prefer some creditors over others, or created such security after its insolvency; - issued such Note Guarantee or created such security interest in a situation where a prudent business person as a shareholder of such Guarantor or security provider would have contributed equity to such Guarantor or security provider or where the relevant beneficiary of the Note Guarantees or security interest knew or should have known that the Guarantor or security provider was insolvent or a filing for insolvency had been made; or - received less than reasonably equivalent value for incurring the debt represented by the Note Guarantees or security interest in the Collateral on the basis that the Note Guarantees or security interest in the Collateral was incurred for our benefit, and only indirectly the Guarantor’s or security provider’s benefit, or on some other basis and (i) was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of the issuance of the Note Guarantees or the creation of the security interest, or subsequently became insolvent for other reasons; (ii) was engaged, or was about to engage, in a business transaction for which the Guarantor’s or security provider’s assets were unreasonably small; or (iii) intended to incur, or believed it would incur, debts beyond its ability to make required payments as and when they would become due. Different jurisdictions evaluate insolvency on various criteria, but a Guarantor or security provider generally may, in different jurisdictions, be considered insolvent at the time it issued a Note Guarantee or created any security interest in the Collateral if: - its liabilities exceed the fair market value of its assets; - it cannot pay its debts as and when they become due; or - the present saleable value of its assets is less than the amount required to pay its total existing debts and liabilities, including contingent and prospective liabilities, as they mature or become absolute. Although we believe that the Issuers and the Group are solvent, and will be so after giving effect to the Transactions, there can be no assurance as to which standard a court would apply in determining 84 ----- whether a Guarantor or security provider was “insolvent” as of the date such Note Guarantee was issued or the security interests in the Collateral were created or that, regardless of the method of valuation, a court would not determine that a Guarantor or security provider was insolvent on that date, or that a court would not determine, regardless of whether or not a Guarantor or security provider was insolvent on the date its Note Guarantee was issued or the security interests in the Collateral were created, that payments to holders of the Notes constituted fraudulent transfers on other grounds.

The directors, managers and/or executive officers of the Issuer and the Guarantors are non-residents of the United States. Although we and the Guarantors will submit to the jurisdiction of certain New York courts in connection with any action under US securities laws, you may be unable to effect service of process within the United States on these directors, managers and executive officers. In addition, as all of the assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors and their respective subsidiaries and those of their directors and executive officers are located outside of the United States, you may be unable to enforce judgments obtained in the US courts against them. Moreover, actions of the Issuers and the Guarantors may not be subject to the provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States. The United States is not currently bound by a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitral awards, rendered in civil and commercial matters with England and Wales. There is, therefore, doubt as to the enforceability in England and Wales of US securities laws in an action to enforce a US judgment in such jurisdictions. In addition, the enforcement in England and Wales of any judgment obtained in a US court, whether or not predicated solely upon US federal securities laws, will be subject to certain conditions. There is also doubt that a court in England and Wales would have the requisite power or authority to grant remedies sought in an original action brought in such jurisdictions on the basis of US securities laws violations.

In such a situation, the Issuers may not have enough funds to purchase all of the then outstanding Notes that are tendered under any such offer. If a significant principal amount of Notes is tendered, the Issuers will likely have to obtain financing to pay for the tendered Notes. However, the Issuers may not be able to obtain such financing on acceptable terms, if at all. A change of control may also result in a mandatory prepayment under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement and agreements governing any future indebtedness. The repurchase of the Notes pursuant to such an offer could cause a default under such indebtedness, even if the change of control 87 ----- itself does not. Any failure by the Issuer to offer to purchase the Notes upon a change of control would constitute a default under the Indenture, which would, in turn, constitute a default under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement.

We serve a wide range of clients that include large MNCs, SMEs, individual consumers, and other third-party brokers and MGAs. We distribute our insurance products across multiple channels, including through a network of over 120 local offices in the United Kingdom and more than 150 offices worldwide, and online. Our global network provides the basis for deep, embedded local relationships and “trusted advisor” status with clients and benefits from long-standing trusted insurer partner relationships.

We have completed or entered into acquisition agreements for more than 150 acquisitions since our establishment in 2017, which represents an enterprise value of over £3.2 billion with a year-to-date average “add-on” enterprise value multiple of 6.6 times and a “platform” enterprise value multiple of 9.6 times. Acquisitions completed during the fourth quarter of 2023 (including the impact of the AccuRisk disposal) contributed Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA of £13.6 million for the twelve months ended September 30, 2023. We also have further 36 acquisitions that are contractually committed or under signed letter of intent as of February 1, 2024, which would contribute an additional £32.2 million of Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA. Our pipeline includes targets on multiple continents. We intend to continue to pursue further strategic and financially accretive acquisitions of businesses, assets or insurance books when opportunities exist and fit with our corporate culture and overall strategy. Our major acquisitions since mid-2020 include, among others: - Arachas, a commercial insurance broker in Ireland in 2020; - Bravo, which comprises Broker Network and Compass, two established network service providers to regional insurance brokers and Ethos Broking, a highly active acquisition platform focused on the UK regional insurance market, in 2020; - Resilium Pty Limited, the founding business of our Australian platform, in February 2021; - Hemsley Wynne Furlong LLP, a specialist M&A warranty and indemnity insurance broker and advisor, in March 2021; - Usay Group Limited, one of the largest consumer personal medical insurance and protection insurance brokers in the UK, in September 2021; - the Hooper Dolan companies, a client-focused general insurance broker with offices across Ireland, in October 2021; - the insurance operations of BGC Partners Inc., a leading global brokerage and financial technology company, in November 2021; - the Léons Group, a family-owned independent insurance brokerage and consultancy firm based in the Netherlands, in October 2022; - Glennon Insurances, a leading provider of insurance solutions in Ireland, in December 2022; - the MDS Group, an insurance broker and risk management advisor primarily based in Portugal and Brazil, with offices in Angola, Mozambique, Spain, Switzerland and Malta, in December 2022; - Envest PTY Limited, an Australian insurance investment and distribution group, in February 2023; - the Oxford Insurance Group, a Lloyd’s broker with further operations in Switzerland, Liechtenstein and Dubai, in March 2023; - the SRS Group, an Athens-based group whose businesses include an independent wholesale reinsurance broker and a managing general agencies (“MGA”) platform, in June 2023; 97 ----- - Klap Verzekeringsmakelaar, a Dutch specialist commercial lines insurance broker, in June 2023; - Classicus, a high-net-worth broker headquartered in the Netherlands, in August 2023; and - ASSEPRO, one of the largest independent commercial brokers for small and medium-sized enterprises in Switzerland, with additional operations in Austria and Liechtenstein, in November 2023. We also enter into disposals and other similar transactions from time to time. In September 2023, we announced the merger and disposal of the Retail platform with the Markerstudy Group, with our shareholders maintaining a minority stake in the Merged Business. The transaction values Atlanta at £1.2 billion. The Retail Transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals. As a result of this merger and the resulting disposal of the Retail platform, we have presented Retail as held for sale on our consolidated statement of financial position as of September 30, 2023 and as a discontinued operation on our consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income for the nine months period ended September 30, 2023 and the period ended September 30, 2022. See “Summary—Recent Developments—Retail Transaction.” In addition, on October 30, 2023, we agreed to sell the subsidiaries of Alpha Investment Holdings Limited, including the AccuRisk Solutions LLC group of entities, to Ryan Specialty.

The insurance market cycle is defined as “softening” and “hardening.” “Soft” periods are characterized by falling or stagnant premium rates and are driven normally by excessive supply of capital from insurance companies and other market participants competing for available business. Soft markets on average result in low profitability for the insurers and as a result lower commissions for brokers. “Hard” periods can be precipitated by catastrophes, such as natural disasters, or similar significant losses, for example, severe credit market losses, that result in insurers’ capital becoming depleted or some insurers no longer being able to participate in the market. The lack of capital and decreased competition drives up premium rates, thereby the potential for greater profitability for the remaining insurers. Additionally, catastrophes or similar significant losses may also precipitate increased customer demand for insurance policies, driving demand for capital and further hardening the market.",N/A,as_expected,2024,879
1923_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.2,Significant Factors Affecting Results of Operations,17.2.3,Commission and Fees,"As an insurance intermediary, we derive our revenue primarily from commission and fees. Our commission income is generally based on insurance premiums and negotiated commission rates, and 98 ----- fees are paid for claims administration or other individual services based on negotiated amounts. We derive a small portion of our commission income from profit commission agreements with our insurers. Profit commissions are typically dependent upon the underwriting profitability of the business placed with the insurer, which is a function of premiums earned less commission paid, claims costs, insurer expenses and the target financial returns for the insurer. We are less able to forecast profit commissions than premium based commissions due to the link with variable insurance events and the inherent volatility this brings. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry— _Volatility or _declines in premiums, declines in commission rates or increases in applicable premium taxes may seriously undermine our business and results of operations.” Furthermore, catastrophic events, whether_ natural or otherwise, can have a significant effect on the number and value of claims being made, and therefore a significant effect on the profitability of the business we place with the insurance company. Changes in profit commissions are largely attributable to economic and market conditions that are outside of our control and that affect premium prices and lead to increases or decreases in overall claims. We also offer customers access to premium finance providers for a fee. A premium finance provider covers the upfront costs of insurance premiums and bills the individual or company in installments to recover the insurance premium cost.",N/A,as_expected,2024,879

In our Specialty Broking platform, we focus on retaining and attracting income producers and optimizing our panel of products and capacity providers. Part of our strategy is to drive our existing hires to maturity and hire exceptional individuals who can swiftly add value to our Group. We added Adjusted EBITDA of approximately £30 million for the twelve months ended September 30, 2023 from 29 new producer teams hired since 2020. Organic growth has accelerated since 2021 in part by the maturing income profile of new hires in prior periods. Our investments in new hires often result in losses in the early years while they build up our client base. Costs associated with transformational hires include recruitment costs, sign-on bonuses, cost of retention, and salary costs while hires are under restrictive non-compete covenants or are impacted by insurer capacity restrictions. Teams typically mature to their full profitability potential approximately three years after the expiry of capacity or covenant restrictions. Seven teams hired in 2020 were at 75% maturity as of September 30, 2023, seven teams hired in 2021 were at 58% maturity as of September 30, 2023 and seven teams hired in 2022 were at 37% maturity as of September 30, 2023. In addition, we hired six teams that started trading in 2023. As a result, we expect to realize additional Adjusted EBITDA as a result of these hires over the next three years. We have also focused on expansion into new geographies and into new products and niches. Since 2020, we have expanded our addressable markets in new synergistic geographies through acquisitions such as the MDS Group in Brazil, Klap Verzekeringsmakelaar and the Léons Group in the Netherlands and ASSEPRO in Switzerland and Austria. In addition, in 2021, we launched Inver Re, a new reinsurance broker with ambitions to harness our scale, resources and reach to offer a credible alternative to global brokers and become our industry’s independent reinsurance broker of choice.",N/A,as_expected,2024,879

A significant amount of our income from our Specialty Broking and Global P&C: International Advisory specialty is denominated in U.S. dollars and euros, although Specialty segment costs are incurred substantially in pound sterling. We enter into forward contracts to mitigate the exposure resulting from USD revenue arising on the placement of certain premiums denominated in USD. If we are unable to hedge our foreign currency revenues or otherwise match brokerage and fees received in foreign currencies with costs paid in the same currency, results of operations may be affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations. As a result of the Transactions, we expect to have a significantly improved natural hedging profile, as the proportionate mix of currencies within the anticipated capital structure (Australian dollar, euro and U.S. dollar) much more closely match the currencies in which operational cash flow is generated. Furthermore, as we present our consolidated financial statements in pound sterling, we are required to translate the assets, liabilities, income and expenses of all operations that use a functional currency other than pound sterling, such as U.S. dollars. We translate into pound sterling at then-applicable exchange rates, exposing us to translation risk (i.e., the risk that exchange rates will impact the value of our income, assets, liabilities and expenses reported in pound sterling even if the value has not changed in U.S. dollars) should the pound sterling strengthen against the U.S. dollar. Furthermore, our international expansion strategy exposes us to additional translation risk.

Like many of our competitors, we have historically transacted less business from November to February than in other months. Accordingly, commission and fees for the first and fourth quarter tend to be slightly lower than the second and third quarter. In addition, our use of cash is seasonal. For example, we pay certain bonuses to employees (in March of each year) and certain amounts to tax authorities (in April of each year), resulting in higher cash uses during such periods. In addition, we currently have two payment dates for our main debt interest payments in January 2024 and July 2024. A portion of the Retail platform is characterized by highly seasonal revenue as a consequence of traditional policy renewal patterns across the various lines of business. For example, our Carole Nash business experiences seasonality resulting from fewer motorbikes being sold during the winter months and as a consequence fewer motorbike insurance policies are placed during the same period.

Following this merger, on June 1, 2022, AGHL acquired Ardonagh New Midco 3 Limited, including the Group companies that were previously owned by The Ardonagh Group Limited, and became the reporting entity for the Group. AGHL’s first reporting period included all transactions since its incorporation on December 8, 2021 to December 31, 2022, but only includes four months of the results of operations and cash flows of the consolidated operations of AGHL due to the timing of the Tara Transactions. In order to present meaningfully comparable financial information, we present the financial information of (i) the Company for the years ended 2020, 2021 and 2022 and (ii) AGHL for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and the twelve months ended September 30, 2023 in this table. See “Presentation of Financial Information” and note 1 to the Unaudited Interim Financial Statements. (2) The consolidated statement of profit and loss of AGHL for the period ended September 30, 2022 includes all transactions from the incorporation of AGHL on December 8, 2021 to September 30, 2022, but only includes four months of the results of operations of the consolidated operations of AGHL due to the timing of the Tara Transactions. As a result, the comparability between the consolidated statement of profit and loss of AGHL for the period ended September 30, 2022 and the nine months ended 2023 is limited. See “Presentation of Financial Information” and notes 1 and 26 to the Unaudited Interim Financial Statements. (3) As a result of the Retail Transaction, Retail is presented as a discontinued operation in the consolidated statement of loss and other comprehensive income in the financial information of AGHL for the period ended September 30, 2022 and the nine months ended September 30, 2023, and therefore excluded from the results presented in the above table. See “Presentation of Financial _Information” and note 26 to the Unaudited Interim Financial Statements._ (4) In the 2022 Audited Financial Statements, the Parent changed the presentation of investment income and it is now presented as part of finance income. This change in presentation was reflected also in the comparative period.

Our debt service obligations consist primarily of interest payments on the Existing Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the Existing Notes, and following the Transactions, including the Offering, will consist of interest payments on the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the Notes. Although we believe that our expected cash flows from operating activities, together with available borrowings will be adequate to meet our anticipated general liquidity needs and debt service obligations, we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations to meet these needs or that future debt or equity financing will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to fund our liquidity needs, including making payments on the Notes or other debt when due. If our cash flows from operating activities are lower than expected or our capital expenditure requirements exceed our projections, we may be required to seek additional financing, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Our ability to arrange financing generally and our cost of capital depends on numerous factors, including general economic conditions, the availability of credit from banks, other financial institutions, and capital markets, restrictions in instruments governing our debt, and our general financial performance.

For the year ended December 31, 2022, AGHL applied acquisition accounting in accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations to the acquisition of Ardonagh New Midco 3 Limited at fair value on June 1, 2022, which included the recognition of intangible assets arising on a business combination and the recognition of goodwill and non-controlling interests. A critical judgment was applied in the prior year to determine if it was appropriate to apply acquisition accounting, which included consideration of the wider transaction, if there had been a change of control, and who was the acquirer. Acquisition accounting was applied as a business had been acquired and because AGHL clearly obtained control of that business. As at December 31, 2022, we had not completed the acquisition accounting of Ardonagh New Midco 3 Limited. Goodwill recognized in the prior year’s consolidated financial statements was based 119 ----- on provisional fair values of the assets acquired. The initial allocation of goodwill to the cash generating units was also done on a provisional basis in accordance with IAS 36. During 2023, AGHL and its subsidiaries completed the acquisition accounting of Ardonagh New Midco 3 Limited, and the resulting amount of goodwill has been finalized and reallocated to cash-generating units in a manner that is most appropriate to the business. During 2023, AGHL and its subsidiaries entered into negotiations to dispose of the entire share capital of Atlanta Investment Holdings 3 Limited, being the holding company for the Retail operating segment. On September 1, 2023, all material matters fundamental to the deal were agreed upon with the buyer and there were no further matters that could have caused the planned sale to be withdrawn or changed significantly. Consequently, as at that date the disposal group was classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations. At that date, the carrying values of all assets and liabilities within the disposal group were measured in accordance with applicable IFRS and then compared to the fair value less cost to sell of the disposal group. The excess, if any, of the carrying value of the disposal group over its fair value less cost to sell is required to be recognized as an impairment loss. There was no material difference between the carrying value and the fair value less cost to sell of the disposal group and therefore no impairment loss was recognized. Furthermore, in accordance with IFRS 5, from the date of classification as held for sale, non-current assets within the disposal group are not subject to depreciation or amortisation.",N/A,as_expected,2024,879

Other assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may exceed their recoverable amounts. The last annual impairment test was performed as of July 1, 2023. An impairment test of an asset or cash-generating unit (or group of cash-generating units) is performed by comparing its carrying amount with its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use, where its value in use is the present value of its future cash flows. An impairment test requires the application of significant judgment because it relies on key assumptions, including forecast cash flows, a discount rate, a terminal growth rate and an Adjusted EBITDA multiple. Accordingly, the resulting estimates are significant estimates because there is a significant risk of a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of affected balances within the next financial year. Goodwill arising from a new business combination is, for the purposes of impairment testing, allocated to those cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the goodwill that was acquired. Impairment testing is performed at the level of the smallest groups of cash-generating units at which goodwill is monitored, known as the divisions. Forecast cash flows used in the value in use calculation were determined by considering historic business performance, by overlaying it with assumptions to reflect areas where growth or income improvement was expected, and by taking into account the expected results of cost management programs to which we are committed. The forecasts were extrapolated to subsequent years using a steady growth rate being the forecast CPI inflation rate of 2%, and a terminal value was calculated using the perpetual growth model. The discount rate of 9.55% to 11.45% that was applied to the forecasts was a market participant weighted average cost of capital calculated by reference to the Capital Asset Pricing Model. The fair value of AGHL and its subsidiaries was calculated based on multiples of forecast 2024 Adjusted EBITDA and on information provided by external advisors, where that information is based on recent transactions in the insurance broking industry. The fair value of an operating segment was estimated by apportioning the fair value of our group between the operating segments based on the 120 ----- value in use of each operating segment. The estimated costs of disposal are assumed, based on market experience, to be 1.5% of the fair value of the operating segment. As of September 30, 2023, there were no indications of impairment and therefore no impairment test has been performed. 121 -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,879

Traditionally, insurance companies sold indirectly through intermediaries such as brokers and underwriting agencies but in certain markets and product areas they now also sell insurance directly, via telephone or online.

In certain markets and product areas, insurers also distribute products directly to customers. _Brokers_ Broking is the process by which a broker negotiates insurance policy terms for a customer and places that customer’s risk with an appropriate insurance company either directly or through an underwriting agency. Customers include businesses, individuals and public institutions, and, in the case of wholesale brokers, other brokers. Brokers connect insurance companies and underwriting agencies with customers in the insurance supply chain and so act as a distribution channel for insurance products. Insurance companies and underwriting agencies, as the case may be, compensate brokers by means of commissions based on premium levels and fees for individual services. In certain cases, brokers will forego some or all of the commission payable by the insurance company and instead be compensated by the customer for the placement service (particularly in personal lines). _Underwriting agencies_ An underwriting agent serves as an intermediary between an insurance company and a broker or the customer. In addition to providing underwriting services, some underwriting agencies act as MGA by issuing and administering insurance policies and handling insurance claims and renewals on behalf of insurance companies. Such underwriting agencies operate as “virtual insurers”, performing most functions of a traditional insurance company including underwriting and pricing, but excluding the provision of capital and the incurrence of liability in respect of insurance claims. The performance of an underwriting agency can be judged by its underwriting results, the amount of total premiums earned minus the cost of claims and operating expenses. Notably, there may be “loss-sharing” arrangements put in place between the insurance company and the underwriting agency that can impact profitability, depending on underwriting performance. 123 ----- _Price Comparison Websites (PCWs)_ PCWs are internet portals that allow insurance companies and insurance intermediaries to make their insurance products available directly to customers via the internet. Customers can obtain several quotes from insurance companies and insurance intermediaries on aggregator websites by making only one data entry. The insurance company or insurance intermediary with the most appealing (by terms or price) quote issues the insurance policy to the customer and compensates the PCW by means of a referral fee. PCWs are predominantly used to sell personal motor insurance policies and, to a lesser extent, household insurance policies as well as other personal lines products. PCWs have had a limited impact on the sale of commercial lines (except commercial auto) of insurance due to the complexity of the products and the “off-line” advice sought by commercial customers for most commercial insurance products. In many cases, the PCW is reliant on another insurance intermediary, such as a broker or an underwriting agency, to fulfill a number of critical activities such as managing the panel of insurers whose products are available on the website. Similarly, an insurer may contract with a broker to manage the insurer’s presence on a number of PCWs.",N/A,as_expected,2024,879

Network service providers also offer independent brokers access to certain business support services such as handling of client money, risk & compliance and marketing. _Service companies_ As insurers, MGAs, brokers and other participants in the insurance market look to improve cost efficiencies in fulfillment, specialists offering business process outsourcing have become more significant in the market. The initial focus of these service providers have been on claims fulfillment, including completion of the first notification of loss, claims validation, litigation services, and other associated claims services.

1923_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.56,Insurance market structure and size,17.56.1,Industry dynamics and trends,"_Competitive landscape_ The competition for business has been one of the primary factors that has been driving broker consolidation by non-vertically integrated players in the highly competitive UK market in recent years. Consolidation is driven by the need to gain scale to effectively compete with larger, vertically integrated players, particularly in the personal lines market. A variety of other factors have also driven these acquisitions, including the increase in compliance and administrative costs resulting from new FCA regulations, the aging broker demographic, recognition of the potential for economies of scale and the consequent enhanced ability to compete effectively on price to drive increases in win-rates. The group has a proven track record of M&A across all of its platforms, and believes there remain significant opportunities to acquire brokers of varying sizes, which can add capabilities and customer volumes. _UK Insurance distribution trends_ Brokers are the primary distribution channel in the UK non-life market. Client purchasing behavior differs between customer types. Accordingly, brokers account for differing percentages of GWP depending on the type of insurance being transacted with a large majority of commercial premium transacted by brokers compared with a smaller amount of personal lines premium. 125 ----- Brokers will likely remain the largest SME market distribution channel due to the complexity of covers required and development of digital capabilities. With the expansion of the internet, the amount of personal insurance products sold by means of PCWs has grown significantly. Expansion is expected to continue at a more modest rate as customers continue to use PCWs. PCWs will likely continue to dominate the standard personal insurance markets, but will increasingly look to other markets both geographically and from a product perspective. PCWs have previously tried to sell other insurance products directly; however, they experience greater success when partnering with existing product specialists. PCWs allow existing product specialists to make their insurance products available directly to customers via the internet, and as such, PCWs are not direct competitors of existing product specialists, but rather serve as intermediaries between them and end customers. _New emerging risks_ The broker’s role in connection with non-standard risks is becoming increasingly important. The market is experiencing an increased appetite for newer risk categories, including cyber, supply chain and legislative, and as more customers look to insure against these new risks, the role of advice and significance of choice will become more important and the use of on brokers will subsequently increase. This is in particular relevant to any complex, large or otherwise sophisticated risks, which demand a broker-advised sale as opposed to a low involvement sale through PCWs. _Increase in divestment / redistribution of unprofitable products or processes_ As all participants in the insurance market seek to improve profit margins, there is an increasing trend for organizations to divest and outsource unprofitable products or processes to specialists who charge an administrative fee or take a cut of commission. More of the larger insurers and other insurance intermediaries, such as banks and retailers, are actively using white-labelled products from other insurance providers. MGAs, brokers and other participants in the insurance market have also benefitted from the use and distribution of white-labelled products. _Increasing reliance on technology_ Technology is playing an increasingly important role in all aspects of the insurance market.

We have a growing pipeline of new specialist products that is highly complementary to our existing offerings, including high net worth, political violence, specialty terrorism facility. These products are being developed on existing systems and channels at limited upfront cost and are largely linked to new hires, who can contribute the relevant product and channel expertise. As an example, new products launched in our Specialty Broking platform contributed towards organic growth of approximately 11.6% in the twelve months ended September 30, 2023. As part of our organic growth strategy, we are also focused on cross-selling and up-selling and customer retention and expansion. We seek to improve cross-selling and up-selling across Group clients, including by leveraging data. We have rolled out of a Group-wide database in which we collate data from each of our platforms to enable a “single view of the client” (i.e., how many policies are linked to each client across personal and commercial lines) to facilitate retention, cross-selling and up-selling. This database continues to provide a more granular understanding of our clients’ needs, allowing us to offer them tailored cross-selling opportunities. We have also implemented a bespoke pricing system and leveraged our data infrastructure, fraud detection capabilities and access to third-party data sources to improve retention and increase customer lifetime value across most products. In our Specialty Broking platform, we have developed a highly sophisticated customer and broker-facing software which interfaces with several market-leading policy administrative systems and substantially improves ease of access to customer and broker data. We are also in discussions with several third-party brokers who are clients of our wholesale platform to roll-out this software in order to maximize efficiency and centralization within our platform and improve the experience of third-party brokers on our platform. We also intend to leverage our membership of the Worldwide Broker Network to increase existing business and in-flow through the establishment of new relationships and intend to capitalize on our existing global footprint to drive further growth. In the UK, our UK Advisory business launched a focused client strategy aimed at large UK corporates, which is already bearing fruit with the successful signing of several marquee clients, including a global broadcaster that has a £5 billion turnover and also the UK’s largest charity. In addition, in 2021, we launched Inver Re, a new risk strategy and reinsurance broker with ambitions to harness our scale, resources and reach to offer a credible alternative to global brokers and become our industry’s independent reinsurance broker of choice. We plan to further strengthen our reinsurance operations by (i) consolidating our existing reinsurance operations while organically building out our brand, talent and capabilities in key global hubs (such as London, North America & Bermuda), (ii) developing our first party business through leveraging key group carrier relationships, (iii) hiring industry leading talent and building further revenue streams and (iv) deploying M&A to expand geographic focus beyond key hubs (such as in Latin America and Asia). 138 -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,879

We have developed a range of strategies to streamline operations and optimize middle and back-office functions. Our strategy is based on three key pillars of excellence, which are: - _Capacity excellence. We seek to reach capacity excellence by operating a strategic capacity model through our Ardonagh Portfolio Solutions (“APS”) business, part of our Specialty Broking platform. APS utilizes data captured from across the Group’s platforms and businesses to enhance income through a centralized placement. We expect our APS business to be a key growth driver going forward by allowing us to capitalize on a select number of strategic carrier relationships, create market leading products which offer better terms for our customers and access alternative capital providers either directly or in connection with our MGA business. We intend to engage with APS for select high-profitability lines and actively manage the portfolio to reduce exposure to underperforming lines. - _Talent excellence. We believe that we will be able to deliver significant incremental income and EBITDA growth by nurturing talent excellence. We are working to attract the best people in our industry and are ideally placed to capitalize on market dislocation. We believe that incoming hires bring capabilities and are highly accretive. We have a strong track record of income hires and producer recruitment, delivering significant incremental income and EBITDA. We intend to leverage our success to date to continue selective transformational hires, focusing on hiring exceptional individuals who can swiftly add value to our Group. Since 2019, we have secured at least five new specialist team hires per year, and currently have a deep pipeline of future hires. We also intend to deliver on exceptional existing hires, relentlessly focusing on renewal retention, leveraging existing retail and wholesale relationships. - _Operational excellence. We believe that through operational excellence we can continue our track record of delivering value through our focus on operational expertise. We have delivered cost efficiencies to drive margin expansion across all divisions, resulting in approximately £150 million of synergies and cost savings delivered to date since the start of 2018, and £15.8 million of cost savings and cost synergies expected to be delivered within the next twelve months, consisting of (i) £3.2 million within the UK Advisory platform resulting from benefits from a target operating model implementation project that has reduced headcount through efficiency gains from optimizing policy administration systems, IT transformations from improving the office network, removing legacy applications and outsourcing and an onshoring finance project expected to deliver benefits from process efficiencies and automation, (ii) £8.2 million within the Specialty Broking platform resulting from the technology-led transformation of our middle and back office functions and the cost synergies identified with the acquisition of Corant Global, including the harmonization of reward structures, footprint consolidation and backoffice optimization, as well as the acquisition of Oxford Insurance, (iii) £3.9 million within the International Advisory platform through the ‘hub and spoke’ model and the integration of further acquisitions into existing platforms and (iv) £0.5 million through back-office optimization in our Corporate segment.

Our strategy was to integrate acquisitions and streamline the operations through centralized, in-country IT and data, carrier placements and back office functions. During our second phase, between 2019 and 2022, we shifted our focus to broader international expansion, acquiring businesses with the aim to diversify and expand our footprint while continuing to focus on operational excellence, with the aim of improving margins in our UK markets. With the integration of acquisitions and our disciplined approach to operational excellence, we have delivered approximately £150 million of synergies and cost savings since the start of 2018.

We also provide standard non-specialist insurance products tailored to specific sectors or risks that may be more difficult to place elsewhere in the insurance market. UK Advisory maintains a strong community focus through our network of over 120 offices across the United Kingdom.

The diverse capabilities that reside within our talented workforce fulfil the needs of our industry to provide a high-quality service, and we have taken a series of measures to encourage the promotion of diversity throughout our workforce and in senior leadership roles. With respect to engagement, we use a collaboration and communication app called “Engage” to connect all colleagues across the Group. We also set up an internal communication called “Radio Ardonagh” to showcase achievements from across the Group and celebrate the successes of colleagues. We believe all our people should be able to access high quality learning, development, and engagement opportunities, so they can realize their potential and enjoy successful and meaningful careers. Throughout 2023 we have engaged with employees through targeted campaigns that promote subjects relating to the Group’s well-established ED&I forums and wider colleague base. These have focused on issues such as mental health awareness, support for communities through Give Back Week, Pride, International Women’s Day and more. In April 2023, Ardonagh launched its bespoke Carbon Literacy Training Programme, which was created and developed in-house in collaboration with the Carbon Literacy Trust. This program aims to educate our employees on the actions they can take to reduce their carbon footprint and to develop their own business specific projects to create greater climate awareness at a local business level. The program was accredited by the Carbon Literacy Trust in June 2023 and is being rolled out across the wider group via the learning and development team and the Sustainability Champions forum. We work with hundreds of companies across our supply chain, and expect our suppliers to meet high standards in areas such as ethical conduct, human rights, workplace standards and the environment. We have established due diligence processes to help select suppliers who meet these high standards. All our employees are enrolled in our Group’s Diversity, Equality and Inclusion training module as part of their annual training plan. We are working on deploying remuneration strategies to address the gender pay gap. 148 -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,879

1923_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,212,BUSINESS,212.15,Regulation,212.15.1,,"UK-domiciled trading entities within our Group are authorized and regulated by the FCA to carry on insurance broking and other insurance mediation activities in the United Kingdom pursuant to FSMA and its related statutory instruments. Our insurance mediation activities must comply with the FCA Rules and guidelines that impose, amongst other things, a high-level standard on the establishment and maintenance of proper systems and controls and minimum threshold conditions that must be satisfied for an insurance broking firm to remain authorized. The FCA Rules impose certain minimum capital and liquidity requirements on firms as well as an ongoing obligation to regularly provide the FCA with certain information. The FCA has extensive investigative and disciplinary powers. In addition, individuals performing various ‘Senior Management’ functions are required to be approved by the FCA. A number of senior management personnel located within our regulated entities are approved and are required to satisfy certain fitness and propriety criteria. The FCA maintains an active supervision of the Group, via a dedicated supervisor, to assess our compliance with regulatory requirements. This also allows us to work closely with the FCA to address areas of potential regulatory scrutiny. The FCA plays a critical role in the insurance intermediary industry and is an important stakeholder for our Group. The FCA has been appraised of the development of our Group from the outset of its conception by our management team. We have engaged with the FCA with full transparency and acted swiftly and appropriately when required, and will continue to do so in connection with the future development of our Group. This track record of working with the FCA is demonstrated by the resolution of historic regulatory concerns. Some of our businesses have temporarily failed to meet regulatory expectations in the past, including those concerning governance and control frameworks and client money. Some of these previous failings were referenced in change of control approvals when the Group acquired these 151 ----- businesses, and the Group has implemented structured remediation plans to address these failings to the FCA’s satisfaction. For example, the FCA concluded that the previous Towergate Group had significant failings in respect of its governance arrangements, business model, financial stability and with elements of its operational and client money controls which needed to be strengthened. For these reasons, the FCA had put the Group on its ‘Watchlist’, denoting a high regulatory risk profile. The management of the Group has worked closely with the FCA to resolve these concerns over time, including overhauling risk, compliance and governance arrangements. During this remediation process (at the end of 2018), our Group acquired Swinton, which was also on the FCA Watchlist. We therefore extended our regulatory remediation plans to address the risks that applied to Swinton (which also included governance and risk management concerns). In January 2020, the FCA confirmed it was satisfied with the remediation of all Watchlist items, including those applying to the previous Towergate and Swinton businesses, and therefore removed the Group’s businesses from its Watchlist. Since then, the Group has continued to work with its FCA supervisor to provide assurance over the effective management of UK regulatory change and demonstrate it has addressed any industry-wide concerns or matters of note. Our board and executive team continue to work closely with the FCA to demonstrate ongoing progress in regulated areas in which previous control weaknesses were identified. Since the formation of the Group, and following subsequent acquisitions, we have extended consistent control and governance improvements across the whole Group, regularly updating the FCA and meeting the timescales we communicated for such integration. The Paymentshield business has sold and continues to sell mortgage payment protection insurance (“MPPI”) which has been the subject of industry-wide scrutiny by the FCA and the Competition and Markets Authority (“CMA”). Paymentshield’s products are not analogous to the payment protection insurance products that have attracted the most FCA scrutiny. Paymentshield’s MPPI has no cancellation fees and proportionate refunds are offered, and premiums are payable monthly and are not capitalized upfront as part of the principal amount of the customer’s loan. Therefore, the FCA excluded Paymentshield from its 2017 Policy Statement “PS17/3 Payment protection insurance complaints: feedback on CP16/20 and final rules and guidance,” as its products were not in scope for this industry inquiry which led to significant customer redress for higher risk products. In addition, Paymentshield policies are distributed by third-party regulated brokers responsible for the sales processes, so any misselling complaints would likely relate to the third-party brokers rather than Paymentshield. We maintain diverse but individually smaller operations outside of the UK, including several trading entities in the following EU member states: the Republic of Ireland, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Austria, Portugal and Greece. A number of these businesses have a similar regulatory profile to the UK businesses within the Group, and the Group has significant experience in respect of the regulations that apply to these operations given that shared legislation (which previously applied in the UK prior to it formally separating from the EU on December 31, 2020) such as the EU Insurance Distribution Directive (IDD) and data protection regulation have a common EU source. We also maintain subsidiaries in Australia, South Africa, Bermuda, Dubai, Brazil, Malaysia and the United States, among others, and part of a joint venture in Hong Kong. In each case, local management have established practices which comply with local regulatory requirements and all businesses adhere to the Group’s overall governance and risk management frameworks, which have been updated to allow for the increased diversity of the Group. We have received no material regulatory scrutiny on non-UK operations but have proactively engaged with some regulators in more material territories, including presenting our plans and governance arrangements to the Central Bank of Ireland. Changes to the UK regulatory framework are likely in the near term as a result of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2023 (the “2023 Act”), which received Royal Assent on June 29, 2023. Although certain provisions came into force on that date, the UK Government is taking a phased approach to its implementation and other provisions will come into force on days to be appointed (unless already 152 ----- specified). The 2023 Act permits the revocation of all retained EU law relating to financial services, including the Insurance Distribution Directive, although such revocation will only take effect once regulators have drafted and consulted on replacement rules and are ready to enforce them. Other changes implemented by the 2023 Act include: (a) a new statutory objective for the FCA requiring the regulator to act in a way which facilitates the long-term growth and international competitiveness of the UK economy; and (b) a requirement for the regulator to consider the sustainable growth in the UK economy in the medium or long term in a manner consistent with the UK’s net zero emissions commitments.",N/A,as_expected,2024,879

The Senior Secured Indenture will not be qualified under the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended. The following description is a summary of the material provisions of the Senior Secured Indenture and the Senior Secured Notes and refers to the Senior Secured Escrow Agreement, the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement. It does not restate those agreements in their entirety. We urge you to read the Senior Secured Indenture, the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Secured Escrow Agreement, the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement because they, and not this description, define your rights as Holders of the Senior Secured Notes. Copies of the Senior Secured Indenture, the form of the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Secured Escrow Agreement, the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement are available as set forth in this Offering Memorandum under the caption “Where You Can Find More Information.” We intend to use the proceeds of the offering of the Senior Secured Notes, together with proceeds from drawings under the Term Facilities, proceeds from the Senior Notes (as defined below) sold on the Issue Date and certain proceeds from the Retail Transaction, (i) to fund the Existing Notes Redemption; (ii) to repay drawn amounts under the Existing Senior Secured Credit Facilities; (iii) to pay the fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Transactions, including fees and expenses incurred in connection with the offering of the Senior Secured Notes and redemption costs incurred in connection with the Existing Notes Redemption; and (iv) for general corporate purposes, including one or more acquisition opportunities in the near term.

Substantially concurrently with the closing of the offering, the gross proceeds of the Dollar Senior Secured Notes sold on the Issue Date will be deposited into the Dollar Senior Secured Escrow Account (as defined below) and the gross proceeds of the Euro Senior Secured Notes sold on the Issue Date will be deposited into the Euro Senior Secured Escrow Account (as defined below).

See “Escrow of Proceeds; Special _Mandatory Redemption.”_ The Senior Secured Indenture will be subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (as defined below). The terms of the Intercreditor Agreement are important to understanding relative ranking of indebtedness and security, the ability to make payments in respect of the indebtedness, procedures for undertaking enforcement action, subordination of certain indebtedness (including the Note Guarantees), turnover obligations, release of security and guarantees, and the payment waterfall for amounts received by the Security Agent. The registered Holder of a Senior Secured Note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. Only registered Holders will have rights under the Senior Secured Indenture, including, without limitation, with respect to enforcement and the pursuit of other remedies. The Senior Secured Notes have not been, and will not be, registered under the U.S. Securities Act and are subject to certain transfer restrictions. As of the Issue Date, all the Company’s Subsidiaries will be “Restricted Subsidiaries” for purposes of the Senior Secured Indenture. However, under the circumstances described below under “—Certain _Definitions—Unrestricted Subsidiary”, we will be permitted to designate certain of our Subsidiaries as_ “Unrestricted Subsidiaries.” Our Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants in the Senior Secured Indenture and will not guarantee the Senior Secured Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2024,879

In addition, subject to the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement and the Agreed Security Principles, certain other Restricted Subsidiaries may provide a Note Guarantee in the future if required by the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Additional Guarantees”. The Note Guarantees will be joint and several obligations of the Guarantors. The Note Guarantee of each Guarantor will: - be a general senior obligation of such Guarantor; - be secured as set forth under “—Security”; - rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future Indebtedness of such Guarantor that is not expressly subordinated in right of payment to its Note Guarantee, including its obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement (although any liabilities in respect of obligations under the Super Senior Revolving Facility will, and certain hedging agreements (if any) and certain other indebtedness that is secured by the Collateral may, receive proceeds from an enforcement of such security (or any distressed disposal in lieu thereof) in priority to the Holders); - rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future Indebtedness of such Guarantor that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to its Note Guarantee, including its Guarantee of the Senior Notes; - be effectively subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness or obligation of such Guarantor that is secured by property and assets that do not secure such Note Guarantee, to the extent of the value of the property and assets securing such Indebtedness; and - be structurally subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness of the Subsidiaries of such Guarantor that are not Guarantors, including obligations to trade creditors. The obligations of a Guarantor under its Note Guarantee will be limited as necessary to prevent the relevant Note Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance, preference, transfer at under value or unlawful financial assistance under applicable law, or otherwise to reflect corporate benefit rules, “thin capitalization” rules, retention of title claims, laws on the preservation of share capital, limitations of corporate law, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally or other limitations under applicable law which, among other things, might limit the amount that can be guaranteed by reference to the net assets and legal capital of the relevant Guarantor. Additionally, the Note Guarantees will be subject compliance with to certain corporate law procedures. The Note Guarantees will be further limited as required under the Agreed Security Principles which apply to and restrict the requirement to grant guarantees and security in favor of obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement and the Senior Secured Notes where, among other things, any such grant would be restricted by general statutory or other legal limitations or requirements and may be precluded if the cost of such grant is disproportionate to the benefit to the creditors, including the Holders, of obtaining the applicable guarantee. By virtue of these limitations, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Note Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Senior Secured Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Note Guarantee. All the operations of the Company will be conducted through its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Group”) and, therefore, the Company and the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will depend on the cash flow of the Group to meet their obligations, including the Company’s obligations under the Proceeds Loan and the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s obligations under the Senior Secured Notes. Under applicable local regulations, cash and cash equivalents held by the Group can only be upstreamed to their direct or indirect parent entities, including to the Company for purposes of servicing its obligations 202 ----- under the Proceeds Loan, to the extent that sufficient profits available for distribution exist within these legal entities and that they continue to meet relevant minimum regulatory capital requirements, as applicable. Given the regulated nature of our business, we have limited ability to grant upstream credit support. As a result, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Guarantors will represent approximately 4.3% of our Adjusted EBITDA (without giving effect to the Retail Transaction) for the twelve months ended September 30, 2023. We intend to grant security in respect of the Senior Secured Notes from additional non-guarantor entities, which, together with the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Guarantors, represent 52.1% of our Adjusted EBITDA (without giving effect to the Retail Transaction) for the twelve months ended September 30, 2023. As of September 30, 2023, after giving pro forma effect to the Transactions and the Retail Transaction as if they had occurred on that date, the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries would have had £3,749 million (equivalent) of indebtedness, of which an estimated £2,842 million (equivalent, including the Senior Secured Notes) represented senior secured indebtedness and £108 million represented lease liabilities and other indebtedness of entities other than the Company, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Guarantors. In addition, there would have been £191.5 million (equivalent) available for drawing under the Super Senior Revolving Facility (prior to giving effect to any increase in respect of commitments thereunder, which we expect may result in between £240-300 million of commitments available for drawing) and, after giving effect to the Transactions, an expected U.S.$175 million, €165 million and AUD100 million expected to be available for drawing under CAR Facilities. Claims of creditors of non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries, including trade creditors and creditors holding debt and guarantees issued by those Restricted Subsidiaries, and claims of preferred stockholders (if any) of those Restricted Subsidiaries and minority stockholders of non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries (if any) generally will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of those Restricted Subsidiaries over the claims of creditors of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Guarantors, including Holders of the Senior Secured Notes. The Senior Secured Notes and each Note Guarantee therefore will be structurally subordinated to creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred stockholders (if any) of Restricted Subsidiaries of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer (other than the Guarantors) and minority stockholders of non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries (if any). Although the Senior Secured Indenture will limit the Incurrence of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock of Restricted Subsidiaries, the limitation is subject to a number of significant exceptions. Moreover, the Senior Secured Indenture will not impose any limitation on the Incurrence by Restricted Subsidiaries of liabilities that are not considered Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock under the Senior Secured Indenture.

In addition, no Additional Amounts shall be paid with respect to a Holder who is a fiduciary or a partnership or any person other than the beneficial owner of the Senior Secured Notes, to the extent that the beneficiary or settler with respect to such fiduciary, the member of such partnership or the beneficial owner would not have been entitled to Additional Amounts had such beneficiary, settler, member or beneficial owner directly held such Senior Secured Notes. The Payor will (i) make any required withholding or deduction and (ii) remit the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant tax authority in the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction in accordance with applicable law.

On the Change of Control Payment Date, if the Change of Control shall have occurred, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will, to the extent lawful: (1) accept for payment all Senior Secured Notes or portions thereof properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer; (2) deposit with the relevant Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Senior Secured Notes so tendered; (3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Notes or portions of the Senior Secured Notes being purchased by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer in the Change of Control Offer. A Holder willing to tender Notes into the Change of Control Offer shall notify its account manager of its election (or otherwise take action in accordance with the procedures of the Relevant Clearing System (as applicable)), who shall in turn notify the relevant Paying Agent and the Trustee of such Holder’s election. Once such tender has been accepted by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and notified to the relevant Paying Agent, the relevant Paying Agent shall promptly credit to the bank account of such Holder the Change of Control Payment for such Senior Secured Notes so tendered and deduct the corresponding amount of such Senior Secured Notes from such Holder’s account with the Relevant Clearing System. Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Senior Secured Indenture does not contain provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Senior Secured Notes Issuer repurchase or redeem the Senior Secured Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. Holders’ right to require the Senior Secured Notes Issuer to repurchase Notes upon the occurrence of a Change of Control may deter a third party from seeking to acquire the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or its Subsidiaries in a transaction that would constitute a Change of Control. The Senior Secured Notes Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Senior Secured Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and purchases all Senior Secured Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditioned upon the consummation of such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place providing for the Change of Control at the time the Change of Control Offer is made. The Senior Secured Notes Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Senior Secured Notes pursuant to this covenant. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of the Senior Secured Indenture, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control provisions of the Senior Secured Indenture by virtue of such compliance. 227 ----- The Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s ability to repurchase Notes issued by it pursuant to a Change of Control Offer may be limited by a number of factors. The Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement will provide, and future credit agreements or other agreements to which the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Subsidiary becomes party may provide that certain change of control events with respect to the borrowers thereunder, or the Company, could require a prepayment, repayment or cancellation of such facility and the Senior Notes will also require the issuer of the Senior Notes to make an offer to repurchase the Senior Notes upon the occurrences of certain changes of control. If we experience a change of control that requires a prepayment, repayment or cancellation under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement, the Senior Notes or future Indebtedness, we could seek a waiver or seek to refinance the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the Senior Notes and/or such other Indebtedness. In the event we do not obtain such waiver or do not refinance the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the Senior Notes and/or such other Indebtedness, such failure could cause a default thereunder and could result in amounts outstanding thereunder to be declared due and payable. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Senior Secured Notes Issuer to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes could cause a default under, or require a repurchase of, such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Senior Secured Notes Issuer. Finally, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders upon a repurchase may be limited by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s then existing financial resources. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. See “Risk _Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Note Guarantees and the Collateral—An Issuer may not be able to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control. In addition, under certain circumstances, an Issuer may have the right to purchase all outstanding Notes in connection with a tender offer, even if certain holders do not consent to the tender”._ The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition, in one or a series of related transactions, of all or substantially all the assets of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to specified other Persons. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder may require the Senior Secured Notes Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes as described above. The provisions of the Senior Secured Indenture relating to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of Holders of a majority in outstanding principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2024,879

The amount of any Indebtedness outstanding as of any date shall be (a) the accreted value thereof in the case of any Indebtedness issued with original issue discount and (b) the principal amount, or liquidation preference thereof, in the case of any other Indebtedness. If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary as of such date (and, if such Indebtedness is not permitted to be Incurred as of such date under the covenant described under this “—Limitation on Indebtedness,” the Senior Secured Notes Issuer shall be in Default of this covenant). For purposes of determining compliance with any U.S. dollar-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of Indebtedness, the Dollar Equivalent of the principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in another currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was Incurred, in the case of term Indebtedness, or first committed or first Incurred (whichever yields the lower Dollar Equivalent), in the case of Indebtedness Incurred under a revolving credit facility; _provided that (a) if such Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a currency other than U.S. dollars, and such refinancing would cause the applicable U.S. dollar-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such U.S. dollar-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the amount set forth in clause (2) of the definition of Refinancing Indebtedness; (b) the Dollar Equivalent of the principal amount of any such Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the Issue Date; and (c) if any such Indebtedness that is denominated in a different currency is subject to a Currency Agreement (with respect to the U.S. dollar) covering principal amounts payable on such Indebtedness, the amount of such Indebtedness expressed in U.S. dollar will be adjusted to take into account the effect of such agreement. Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing.",N/A,as_expected,2024,879

In relation to any action, matter or transaction (including an Investment or permitted acquisition) which would result in a cumulative increase to Consolidated EBITDA of the Group (in an amount as confirmed by the Company by reference to the date of commitment thereto after giving pro forma effect thereof and any adjustments permitted by the Senior Secured Indenture) (each a “Qualifying Transaction”), from such date until the date on which the internal consolidated financial statements of the Company or the SFA Reporting Entity falling immediately after completion of that Qualifying Transaction are available, the Consolidated Pro Forma EBITDA of the Group for the purposes of all baskets, ratios and thresholds in this Agreement which include a calculation by reference to Consolidated EBITDA shall be increased (on a pro forma basis) by such amount confirmed by the Company. If the value of any of the baskets, ratios or thresholds is subsequently decreased upon such internal consolidated financial statements of the Company or the SFA Reporting Entity becoming available immediately following completion of that Qualifying Transaction, any item undertaken or incurred in good faith prior to any decrease shall be grandfathered and shall continue to be permitted notwithstanding the subsequent reduction in the relevant baskets, ratios or thresholds. For any relevant basket set by reference to a financial year, fiscal year, calendar year or fixed period (each an “Annual Period”): (i) at the option of the Company, the maximum amount so permitted under such basket during such Annual Period may be increased by: (A) an amount equal to 100% of the difference (if positive) between the permitted amount in the immediately preceding Annual Period and the amount thereof actually used or 258 ----- applied by the Group during such preceding Annual Period (the “Carry Forward",N/A,as_expected,2024,879

To the extent that any Indebtedness, Lien, distribution, payment or Investment or other transaction referred to in or contemplated by the definition of Applicable Test Date, satisfies any Applicable Metric, or other test or condition on the Applicable Test Date, such Applicable Metric, test or condition shall be deemed to have been satisfied, including on the date of its incurrence or on any other date of determination under the Senior Secured Indenture and irrespective of any facts or circumstances (including financial condition) on any such date or thereafter. Where any Applicable Metric is calculated in connection with the incurrence of any Permitted Indebtedness and/or the granting of any Permitted Lien, such Applicable Metric may be calculated on a pro forma basis for: (i) the use of the proceeds of such Permitted Indebtedness (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any anticipated increase to Consolidated EBITDA attributable to any Purchase or other transaction to be funded in whole or in part from such Permitted Indebtedness); and (ii) the incurrence and use of the proceeds of any other Permitted Indebtedness in respect of which the Applicable Test Date has occurred. Subject to the sixth paragraph under the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness,” the exchange rates used in the calculation of any Applicable Metric shall be, at the sole election of the Company, from time to time: (i) such rate taking into account any cross currency derivatives entered into by the Group in respect of such amounts, (ii) the weighted average exchange rates for the relevant period, (iii) the spot rate of exchange on the relevant date (elected and determined by the Company acting reasonably and in good faith), (iv) the spot rate of exchange on the Issue Date (elected and determined by the Company acting reasonably and in good faith), or 259 ----- (v) otherwise consistent with the exchange rate methodology applied in the Quarterly Financial Statements or, as the case may be, the Annual Financial Statements for the applicable fourquarter reference period. Any calculation or measure that is determined with reference to the Company’s financial statements (including, without limitation, Consolidated EBITDA, Consolidated Interest Expense, Consolidated Net Income, Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage, Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio, Consolidated Secured Net Leverage, Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio, Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio and Fixed Charges), in the sole discretion of the Company, may be determined with reference to the financial statements of the SFA Reporting Entity (and including, for the avoidance of doubt and without double-counting, amounts related to any Indebtedness of the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries which is not already included therein) or a Parent Entity of the Company instead, so long as, in the case of a Parent Entity, such Parent Entity does not hold any material assets other than, directly or indirectly, the Equity Interests of the Company (as determined by the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Company or the Senior Secured Notes Issuer in good faith).",N/A,as_expected,2024,879

The Trustee shall be entitled to rely on its rights, protections and benefits under the Senior Secured Indenture at all times, including without limitation for actions that are taken and subsequently stayed or annulled. The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Senior Secured Indenture by notice to the Trustee may, on behalf of all Holders, waive all past or existing Defaults or Events of Default (except with respect to nonpayment of principal, premium, interest or Additional Amounts, if any) and rescind any such acceleration with respect to such Senior Secured Notes and its consequences if rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction. Subject to the provisions of the Senior Secured Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee, if an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Senior Secured Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity or security satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal or interest when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the Senior Secured Indenture or the Senior Secured Notes unless: (1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee notice that an Event of Default is continuing and, if such Event of Default is in respect of an Event of Default other than as described in clause (5) of the first paragraph of this section, such Holder is not in breach of a Position Representation or Verification Covenant; (2) Holders, or in the case of any clauses (other than clause (5)) of the first paragraph of this section, Directing Holders that are not in breach of a Position Representation or Verification Covenant, of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have requested the Trustee to pursue the remedy; (3) such Holder has offered the Trustee security or indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense; (4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the request and the offer of such security or indemnity; and (5) the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not given the Trustee a direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period. 263 ----- Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Senior Secured Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee will be required in the exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Senior Secured Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the Senior Secured Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to indemnification or other security satisfactory to it in its sole discretion against all losses, liabilities and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action. The Trustee will have no obligation to monitor compliance by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer with the Senior Secured Indenture. The Senior Secured Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and the Trustee is informed in writing of such occurrence by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the Holders within 60 days after being so notified by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on any Senior Secured Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as the Trustee determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders. The Senior Secured Notes Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, an Officer’s Certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default or Event of Default that occurred and is continuing during the previous year. The Senior Secured Notes Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of any events of which it is aware which would constitute a Default that has occurred and is continuing, their status and what action the Senior Secured Notes Issuer is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof. The Senior Secured Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default occurs for a failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with another default (an “Initial Default”), then at the time such Initial Default is cured, such Default for a failure to report or deliver a required certificate in connection with the Initial Default will also be cured without any further action and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time periods prescribed in the covenant entitled “Certain Covenants— _Reports” or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of the Senior_ Secured Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon the delivery of any such report required by such covenant or notice or certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the Senior Secured Indenture. The Senior Secured Indenture will provide for the Trustee to take action on behalf of the Holders in certain circumstances, but only if the Trustee is indemnified or secured to its satisfaction. It may not be possible for the Trustee to take certain actions in relation to the Senior Secured Notes and, accordingly, in such circumstances the Trustee will be unable to take action, notwithstanding the provision of an indemnity to it, and it will be for Holders to take action directly.",N/A,as_expected,2024,879

In addition, subject to the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement and the Agreed Security Principles, certain other Restricted Subsidiaries may provide a Note Guarantee in the future if required by the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Additional Guarantees”. The Note Guarantees will be joint and several obligations of the Guarantors. The Note Guarantee of the Company will: - be a general senior obligation of the Company; 316 ----- - be secured as set forth under “—Security”; - rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future Indebtedness of the Company that is not expressly subordinated in right of payment to its Note Guarantee; - rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future Indebtedness of the Company that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to its Note Guarantee; - be effectively subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness or obligation of the Company that is secured by property and assets that do not secure such Note Guarantee or that is secured on a first-priority basis over property or assets that secure the Senior Notes on a second-priority basis, to the extent of the value of the property and assets securing such Indebtedness, including the obligations under the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement; and - be structurally subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness of the Subsidiaries of the Company that are not Guarantors, including obligations to trade creditors. The Note Guarantee of each Subsidiary Guarantor will: - be a general senior subordinated obligation of such Subsidiary Guarantor; - be secured as set forth under “—Security”; - rank _pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor that is not expressly subordinated in right of payment to its Note Guarantee; - be subordinated in right of payment to all such Subsidiary Guarantor’s existing and future senior indebtedness, including any obligations under the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement and certain hedging obligations; - rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to its Note Guarantee; - be effectively subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness or obligation of such Subsidiary Guarantor that is secured by property and assets that do not secure such Note Guarantee or that is secured on a first-priority basis over property or assets that secure the Senior Notes on a second-priority basis, to the extent of the value of the property and assets securing such Indebtedness, including the obligations under the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement; and - be structurally subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness of the Subsidiaries of such Subsidiary Guarantor that are not Guarantors, including obligations to trade creditors. The obligations of a Guarantor under its Note Guarantee will be limited as necessary to prevent the relevant Note Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance, preference, transfer at under value or unlawful financial assistance under applicable law, or otherwise to reflect corporate benefit rules, “thin capitalization” rules, retention of title claims, laws on the preservation of share capital, limitations of corporate law, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally or other limitations under applicable law which, among other things, might limit the amount that can be guaranteed by reference to the net assets and legal capital of the relevant Guarantor. Additionally, the Note Guarantees will be subject compliance with to certain corporate law procedures. The Note Guarantees will be further limited as required under the Agreed Security Principles which apply to and restrict the requirement to grant guarantees and security in favor of obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement and the Senior Notes where, among other things, any such grant would be restricted by general statutory or other legal limitations or requirements and may be precluded if the 317 ----- cost of such grant is disproportionate to the benefit to the creditors, including the Holders, of obtaining the applicable guarantee. By virtue of these limitations, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Note Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Senior Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Note Guarantee. All the operations of the Company will be conducted through its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Group”) and, therefore, the Company and the Senior Notes Issuer will depend on the cash flow of the Group to meet their obligations, including the Company’s obligations under the Proceeds Loan and the Senior Notes Issuer’s obligations under the Senior Notes. Under applicable local regulations, cash and cash equivalents held by the Group can only be upstreamed to their direct or indirect parent entities, including to the Company for purposes of servicing its obligations under the Proceeds Loan, to the extent that sufficient profits available for distribution exist within these legal entities and that they continue to meet relevant minimum regulatory capital requirements, as applicable. Given the regulated nature of our business, we have limited ability to grant upstream credit support. As a result, the Senior Notes Issuer and the Guarantors will represent approximately 4.3% of our Adjusted EBITDA (without giving effect to the Retail Transaction) for the twelve months ended September 30, 2023. As of September 30, 2023, after giving _pro forma_ effect to the Transactions and the Retail Transaction as if they had occurred on that date, the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries would have had £3,749 million (equivalent) of indebtedness, of which an estimated £2,842 million (equivalent) represented senior secured indebtedness and £108 million represented lease liabilities and other indebtedness of entities other than the Company, the Senior Notes Issuer or the Guarantors. In addition, there would have been £191.5 million (equivalent) available for drawing under the Super Senior Revolving Facility (prior to giving effect to any increase in respect of commitments thereunder, which we expect may result in between £240-300 million of commitments available for drawing) and, after giving effect to the Transactions, an expected U.S.$175 million, €165 million and AUD100 million expected to be available for drawing under CAR Facilities. Claims of creditors of non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries, including trade creditors and creditors holding debt and guarantees issued by those Restricted Subsidiaries, and claims of preferred stockholders (if any) of those Restricted Subsidiaries and minority stockholders of non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries (if any) generally will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of those Restricted Subsidiaries over the claims of creditors of the Senior Notes Issuer and the Guarantors, including Holders of the Senior Notes. The Senior Notes and each Note Guarantee therefore will be structurally subordinated to creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred stockholders (if any) of Restricted Subsidiaries of the Senior Notes Issuer (other than the Guarantors) and minority stockholders of non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries (if any). Although the Senior Indenture will limit the Incurrence of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock of Restricted Subsidiaries, the limitation is subject to a number of significant exceptions. Moreover, the Senior Indenture will not impose any limitation on the Incurrence by Restricted Subsidiaries of liabilities that are not considered Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock under the Senior Indenture.

The ability to take enforcement action against the Subsidiary Guarantors under their Note Guarantees is 318 ----- subject to significant restrictions imposed by the Intercreditor Agreement and the terms of the Note Guarantees, and potentially any Additional Intercreditor Agreement entered into after the Issue Date. In addition, the Note Guarantees and the Collateral are subject to release under certain circumstances, including, but not limited to, certain enforcement actions taken by the Security Agent acting at the direction of an instructing group of senior secured creditors. Because of the foregoing subordination provisions, it is likely that holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Subsidiary Guarantors would recover disproportionately more than the holders of the Senior Notes in any insolvency or similar proceeding relating to such entity. In any such case, there may be insufficient assets, or no assets, remaining to pay the principal of or interest on the Senior Notes after the repayment in full of all Senior Indebtedness. The Note Guarantees of the Subsidiary Guarantors will also be subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, including payment blockage upon a senior default and standstill on enforcement.

A Holder willing to tender Notes into the Change of Control Offer shall notify its account manager of its election (or otherwise take action in accordance with the procedures of the Relevant Clearing System (as applicable)), who shall in turn notify the Paying Agent and the Trustee of such Holder’s election. Once such tender has been accepted by the Senior Notes Issuer and notified to the Paying Agent, the Paying Agent shall promptly credit to the bank account of such Holder the Change of Control Payment for such Senior Notes so tendered and deduct the corresponding amount of such Senior Notes from such Holder’s account with the Relevant Clearing System. Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Senior Indenture does not contain provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Senior Notes Issuer repurchase or redeem the Senior Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. Holders’ right to require the Senior Notes Issuer to repurchase Notes upon the occurrence of a Change of Control may deter a third party from seeking to acquire the Senior Notes Issuer or its Subsidiaries in a transaction that would constitute a Change of Control. The Senior Notes Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Senior Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Senior Notes Issuer and purchases all Senior Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditioned upon the consummation of such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place providing for the Change of Control at the time the Change of Control Offer is made. The Senior Notes Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Senior Notes pursuant to this covenant. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of the Senior Indenture, the Senior Notes Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control provisions of the Senior Indenture by virtue of such compliance. The Senior Notes Issuer’s ability to repurchase Notes issued by it pursuant to a Change of Control Offer may be limited by a number of factors. The Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement will provide, and future credit agreements or other agreements to which the Senior Notes Issuer or any Subsidiary becomes party may provide that certain change of control events with respect to the borrowers thereunder or the Company, could require a prepayment, repayment or cancellation of such facility. The Senior Secured Notes will also contain requirements similar to those in the Senior Notes to require the Senior Secured Notes Issuer to make a change of control offer upon certain changes of control in respect of the Senior Secured Notes. If we experience a change of control that requires a prepayment, repayment or cancellation under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement or future Indebtedness, or that requires an offer to be made to holders of the Senior Secured Notes, we could seek a waiver or seek to refinance the Senior Secured Credit Facilities or such other Indebtedness or the Senior Secured Notes. In the event we do not obtain such waiver or do not refinance the Senior Secured Credit Facilities or such other Indebtedness or the Senior Secured Notes, such failure could cause a default thereunder and could result in amounts outstanding thereunder to be declared due and payable. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Senior Notes Issuer to repurchase the Senior Notes could cause a default under, or require a repurchase of, such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Senior Notes Issuer. Finally, the Senior Notes Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders upon a repurchase may be limited by the Senior Notes Issuer’s then existing financial resources. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the 340 ----- _Notes, the Note Guarantees and the Collateral—The Issuers may not be able to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control. In addition, under certain circumstances, an Issuer may have the right to purchase all outstanding Notes in connection with a tender offer, even if certain holders do not consent to the tender”._ The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition, in one or a series of related transactions, of all or substantially all the assets of the Senior Notes Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to specified other Persons. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Senior Notes Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder may require the Senior Notes Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Senior Notes as described above. The provisions of the Senior Indenture relating to the Senior Notes Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Senior Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of Holders of a majority in outstanding principal amount of the Senior Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2024,879

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing.",N/A,as_expected,2024,879

On the 631[st] day after an Asset Disposition or such earlier time if the Senior Notes Issuer elects, if the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds the greater of U.S.$110 million and 15% of Consolidated EBITDA, the Senior Notes 356 ----- Issuer will be required to make within 30 Business Days thereof an offer (an “Asset Disposition Offer”) to all Holders and, to the extent the Senior Notes Issuer elects, to all holders of other outstanding Pari Passu Indebtedness, to purchase the maximum principal amount of Senior Notes and any such Pari Passu Indebtedness to which the Asset Disposition Offer applies that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds, at an offer price in respect of the Senior Notes in an amount equal to (and, in the case of any such Pari Passu Indebtedness, an offer price of no more than) 100% of the principal amount of the Senior Notes and 100% of the principal amount of such Pari Passu Indebtedness, in each case, plus accrued and unpaid interest, Additional Amounts and applicable prepayment or redemption premium, if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Senior Indenture or the agreements governing such Pari Passu Indebtedness, as applicable, and in the case of the Senior Notes, in minimum denominations of U.S.$200,000 and in integral multiples of U.S.$1,000 in excess thereof. To the extent that the aggregate amount of Senior Notes so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer and any such Pari Passu Indebtedness so redeemed or repaid is less than the Excess Proceeds, the Senior Notes Issuer may use any remaining Excess Proceeds for general corporate purposes or any other purpose not prohibited by the Senior Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes surrendered in any Asset Disposition Offer by Holders and such other Pari Passu Indebtedness surrendered by holders or lenders, collectively, exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Excess Proceeds shall be allocated among the Senior Notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness to be repaid or purchased on a pro rata basis on the basis (or, in the case of Global Notes, in accordance with the procedures of the relevant clearing system) of the aggregate principal amount of tendered Notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness. For the purposes of calculating the principal amount of any such Indebtedness not denominated in U.S. dollars, such Indebtedness shall be calculated by converting any such principal amounts into their Dollar Equivalent determined as of a date selected by the Senior Notes Issuer that is within the Asset Disposition Offer Period (as defined below). Upon completion of any Asset Disposition Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero. To the extent that any portion of Net Available Cash payable in respect of the Senior Notes is denominated in a currency other than the currency in which the Senior Notes are denominated, the amount thereof payable in respect of such Senior Notes shall not exceed the net amount of funds in the currency in which such Senior Notes are denominated that is actually received by the Senior Notes Issuer upon converting such portion of the Net Available Cash into such currency.

Any breach of the Position Representation shall result in such Directing Holder’s participation in such Noteholder Direction being disregarded; and, if, without the participation of such Directing Holder, the percentage of Senior Notes held by the remaining Holders that provided such Noteholder Direction would have been insufficient to validly provide such Noteholder Direction, such Noteholder Direction shall be void ab initio, with the effect that such Event of Default shall be deemed never to have occurred, and any 374 ----- related acceleration rescinded, and the Trustee shall be deemed not to have received such Noteholder Direction or any notice of such alleged Default or Event of Default, shall not be permitted to act thereon and shall be restricted from accepting and acting on any future Noteholder Direction in relation to such Event of Default, unless such direction is given by Holders holding the requisite level of consent of Holders required under the Senior Indenture to give such Noteholder Direction (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any Directing Holder for so long as such Directing Holder is in breach of its Position Representation). If the Directing Holder has satisfied its Verification Covenant, then the Trustee shall be permitted to act in accordance with such Noteholder Direction. Notwithstanding the above, if such Directing Holder’s participation is not required to achieve the requisite level of consent of Holders required under the Senior Indenture to give such Noteholder Direction, the Trustee shall be permitted to act in accordance with such Noteholder Direction notwithstanding any action taken or to be taken by the Senior Notes Issuer (as described above). The Trustee shall be entitled to conclusively rely on any Senior Noteholder Direction or Officer’s Certificate delivered to it in accordance with the Senior Indenture without verification, investigation or otherwise as to the statements made therein. Each Holder by accepting a Senior Note acknowledges and agrees that the Trustee (and any agent) shall not be liable to any party howsoever arising for acting or refraining to act in accordance with (i) the foregoing provisions, (ii) any Senior Noteholder Direction, (iii) any Officer’s Certificate or (iv) its duties under the Senior Indenture, as the Trustee may determine in its sole discretion. The Trustee shall have no obligation (i) to monitor, investigate, verify or otherwise determine if a Holder has Net Short position, (ii) investigate the merits, validity, accuracy or authenticity of any Position Representation or Officer’s Certificate, as the case may be, (iii) inquire if the Senior Notes Issuer will seek action to determine if a Directing Holder has breached its Position Representation, (iv) enforce any Verification Covenant, (v) monitor any court proceedings undertaken in connection therewith, (vi) monitor or investigate whether any Default or Event of Default has been publicly reported or (vii) otherwise make any calculations, investigations or determinations with respect to any Derivative Instruments, Net Short position, Long Derivative Instrument, Short Derivative Instrument or otherwise. The Trustee shall be entitled to rely on its rights, protections and benefits under the Senior Indenture at all times, including without limitation for actions that are taken and subsequently stayed or annulled. The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Senior Indenture by notice to the Trustee may, on behalf of all Holders, waive all past or existing Defaults or Events of Default (except with respect to nonpayment of principal, premium, interest or Additional Amounts, if any) and rescind any such acceleration with respect to such Senior Notes and its consequences if rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction. Subject to the provisions of the Senior Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee, if an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Senior Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity or security satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal or interest when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the Senior Indenture or the Senior Notes unless: (1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee notice that an Event of Default is continuing and, if such Event of Default is in respect of an Event of Default other than as described in clause (5) of the first paragraph of this section, such Holder is not in breach of a Position Representation or Verification Covenant; (2) Holders, or in the case of any clauses (other than clause (5)) of the first paragraph of this section, Directing Holders that are not in breach of a Position Representation or Verification Covenant, of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have requested the Trustee to pursue the remedy; (3) such Holder has offered the Trustee security or indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense; 375 ----- (4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the request and the offer of such security or indemnity; and (5) the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not given the Trustee a direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period. Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Senior Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee will be required in the exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Senior Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the Senior Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to indemnification or other security satisfactory to it in its sole discretion against all losses, liabilities and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action. The Trustee will have no obligation to monitor compliance by the Senior Notes Issuer with the Senior Indenture. The Senior Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and the Trustee is informed in writing of such occurrence by the Senior Notes Issuer, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the Holders within 60 days after being so notified by the Senior Notes Issuer. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on any Senior Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as the Trustee determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders. The Senior Notes Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, an Officer’s Certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default or Event of Default that occurred and is continuing during the previous year. The Senior Notes Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of any events of which it is aware which would constitute a Default that has occurred and is continuing, their status and what action the Senior Notes Issuer is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof. The Senior Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default occurs for a failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with another default (an “Initial Default”), then at the time such Initial Default is cured, such Default for a failure to report or deliver a required certificate in connection with the Initial Default will also be cured without any further action and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time periods prescribed in the covenant entitled “Certain Covenants—Reports” or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of the Senior Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon the delivery of any such report required by such covenant or notice or certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the Senior Indenture. The Senior Indenture will provide for the Trustee to take action on behalf of the Holders in certain circumstances, but only if the Trustee is indemnified or secured to its satisfaction. It may not be possible for the Trustee to take certain actions in relation to the Senior Notes and, accordingly, in such circumstances the Trustee will be unable to take action, notwithstanding the provision of an indemnity to it, and it will be for Holders to take action directly.",N/A,as_expected,2024,879

Ownership of interests in the 144A Global Notes (the “144A Book-Entry Interests”) and ownership of interests in the Regulation S Global Notes (the “Regulation S Book-Entry Interests” and, together with 144A Book-Entry Interests, the “Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons that have accounts with DTC, in the case of the Global Notes representing the Dollar Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Notes (the “USD Global Notes”), and Euroclear and/or Clearstream, in the case of the Global Notes representing the Euro Senior Secured Notes (the “EUR Global Notes”), or persons that may hold interests through such participants.

The Book-Entry Interests in EUR Global Notes will be issued only in denominations of €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. The Book-Entry Interests will not be held in definitive form. Instead, DTC or Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, will credit on their respective book-entry registration and transfer systems a participant’s account with the interest beneficially owned by such participant. The laws of some jurisdictions, including certain states of the United States, may require that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of such securities in definitive form. The foregoing limitations may impair the ability to own, transfer or pledge Book-Entry Interests. In addition, while the Notes are in global form, owners of interests in the Global Notes will not have the Notes registered in their names, will not receive physical delivery of the Notes in certificated form and will not be considered the registered owners or “holders” of Notes under the Indenture for any purpose. So long as the Notes are held in global form, the custodian for DTC or the common depositary for Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable (or its respective nominee), will be considered the sole Holder of Global Notes for all purposes under the Indenture. As such, participants must rely on the procedures of the DTC or Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, and indirect participants must rely on the procedures of DTC or Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, and the participants through which they own Book-Entry Interests in order to exercise any rights of holders under the Indenture. 426 ----- None of the Company, any future Guarantor, the Trustee, any Paying Agent, the Registrar or the Transfer Agent under the Indenture, nor any of the Issuer’s agents will have any responsibility or be liable for any aspect of the records relating to the Book-Entry Interests.",N/A,as_expected,2024,879

In such an event, the Registrar will issue Definitive Registered Notes, registered in the name or names and issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of DTC or Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable (in accordance with their respective customary procedures and based upon directions received from participants reflecting the beneficial ownership of the Book-Entry Interests), and such Definitive Registered Notes will bear the restrictive legend as provided in the Indenture, unless that legend is not required by the Indenture, or applicable law. To the extent permitted by law, the Issuer, the Trustee, any Paying Agent and the Registrar shall be entitled to treat the registered holder of any Global Note as the absolute owner thereof and no person will be liable for treating the registered holder as such. Ownership of the Global Notes will be evidenced through registration in the register maintained by the Registrar, and such registration is a means of evidencing title to the Notes.

The redemption price payable in connection with the redemption of such Book-Entry Interests will be equal to the amount received by DTC or Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, in connection with the redemption of such Global Note (or any portion thereof). The Issuer understands that under existing practices of DTC or Euroclear and/or Clearstream, if fewer than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, DTC or Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, will credit its respective participants’ accounts on a proportionate basis (with adjustments to prevent fractions) or by lot or on such other basis as it deems fair and appropriate; provided, however, that no Book-Entry Interest of less than $200,000 principal amount (in the case of the USD Global Notes) and €100,000 principal amount (in the case of the EUR Global Notes) at maturity, or less, may be redeemed in part.",N/A,as_expected,2024,879

If a holder requires physical delivery of Definitive Registered Notes for any reason, including to sell the Notes to persons in states which require physical delivery of such securities or to pledge such securities, such holder must transfer its interest in the Global Notes in accordance with the normal procedures of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream and in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture. The Global Notes will bear a legend to the effect set forth in “Notice to Investors.” “Book-Entry Interests _in the Global Notes,” respectively, will be subject to the restrictions on transfer discussed in “Notice to Investors.”_ The 144A Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of Regulation S Book-Entry Interests denominated in the same currency only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture, as applicable) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S of the Securities Act. Through and including the 40th day after the later of the commencement of the offering of the Notes and the closing of the Offering (the “distribution compliance period”), Regulation S Book-Entry Interests will be limited to persons that have accounts with DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream or persons who hold interests through DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream, and any sale or transfer of such interest to U.S. persons shall not be permitted during such period unless such resale or transfer is made pursuant to Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act. Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of 144A Book-Entry Interests, respectively, only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a person who the transferor reasonably believes is a “qualified institutional buyer” within the meaning of Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act or otherwise in accordance with the transfer restrictions described under “Notice to Investors” and in accordance with any applicable securities laws of any other jurisdiction. Subject to the foregoing, and as set forth in “Notice to Investors,” Book-Entry Interests may be transferred and exchanged as described under “Description of the Notes—Transfer and Exchange.” Any Book-Entry Interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Book-Entry Interest in the other Global Note of the same denomination will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the first-mentioned Global Note and become a Book-Entry Interest in the other Global Note, and accordingly, will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in such other Global Note for as long as it retains such a Book-Entry Interest. Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests in a Global Note only as described under “Description of the Notes—Transfer and Exchange” and, if required, only if the transferor first delivers to the Trustee a written certificate (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer will comply with the appropriate transfer restrictions applicable to such Notes. See “Notice to Investors.” Transfers involving an exchange of a Regulation S Book-Entry Interest for 144A Book-Entry Interest will be done by DTC by means of an instruction originating from the Trustee through the DTC Deposit/Withdrawal Custodian system. Accordingly, in connection with any such transfer, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in the principal amount of the relevant Regulation S Global Note and a corresponding increase in the principal amount of the corresponding 144A Global Note. The policies or practices of DTC may prohibit transfer of unrestricted Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Note prior to the expiration of the 40 days after the date of initial issuance of the notes. 429 -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,879
1923_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,61,DESCRIPTION OF THE SENIOR NOTES,61.54,"Information Concerning DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream",61.54.1,,"All Book-Entry Interests will be subject to the operations and procedures of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable. The Issuer provides the following summaries of those operations and procedures solely for the convenience of investors. The operations and procedures of each settlement system are controlled by that settlement system and may be changed at any time. None of the Issuer, the initial purchasers or the Trustee are responsible for those operations or procedures. DTC advised the Issuer that it is a limited-purpose trust company organized under the New York Banking Law, a “banking organization” under the New York Banking Law, a member of the Federal Reserve System, a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code, and a “clearing agency” registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). DTC holds and provides asset servicing for issues of U.S. and non-U.S. equity issues, corporate and municipal debt issues, and money market instruments (that DTC’s direct participants deposit with DTC). DTC also facilitates the posttrade settlement among direct participants of sales and other securities transactions in deposited securities, through electronic computerized book-entry transfers and pledges between direct participants’ accounts. DTC is a wholly owned subsidiary of The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (“DTCC”). DTCC is the holding company for DTC, National Securities Clearing Corporation and Fixed Income Clearing Corporation, all of which are registered clearing agencies. DTCC is owned by the users of its regulated subsidiaries. Access to the DTC system is also available to others such as both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, and clearing corporations that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a direct participant, either directly or indirectly. Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for participating organizations and also facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities transactions between their respective participants through electronic book-entry changes in the accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide various services to their participants, including the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of internationally traded securities. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with domestic securities markets. Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial institutions, such as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear and Clearstream is also available to others, such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear and Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly. Because DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to persons or entities that do not participate in DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream systems, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definite certificate for that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such person may be limited. In addition, owners of beneficial interests through DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream systems will receive distributions attributable to the 144A Global Notes only through DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream participants.",N/A,as_expected,2024,879

While the USD Global Notes may only be traded in denominations of $200,000 and multiples of $1,000 and the Euro Global Notes may only be traded in denominations of €100,000 and multiples of €1,000, for the purpose of Euroclear and Clearstream, the denominations are considered as $1,000 and €1,000, respectively.

The Exchange is a recognised stock exchange for these purposes. Securities will be treated as listed for this purpose if they are officially listed in Guernsey in accordance with provisions corresponding to those generally applicable in EEA states and are admitted to trading on the Exchange. In most other cases, an amount must generally be withheld from payments of interest on the Notes on account of UK income tax at the basic rate (currently 20%), unless an exemption or relief applies (for instance, in connection with a direction by HMRC in respect of relief under an applicable double taxation treaty). References to payments of interest in this section include circumstances where additional Notes are issued as PIK Interest (but, for the avoidance of doubt, do not include circumstances where the principal amount of the outstanding Notes is increased by way of PIK Interest, on the basis that such increase to principal should generally not be treated as being a “payment” for the purposes of the rules relating to the withholding or deduction for or on account of UK income tax until such time as amounts in respect of such interest are actually paid to Noteholders).",N/A,as_expected,2024,879

There are good arguments that such payments do not constitute “interest” for Australian withholding tax purposes, and, if so, would not be subject to Australian IWT.

The Australian Taxation Office (“ATO”) has, however, published Taxation Determination TD 1999/26 which suggests that the ATO considers guarantee payments made on behalf of a company borrower would be “interest” for Australian IWT purposes. There is some doubt as to whether the reasoning adopted in the Taxation Determination is strictly correct.

This discussion is based upon the Code, Treasury regulations issued thereunder (the “Treasury Regulations”), and judicial and administrative interpretations thereof, each as in effect on the date hereof, and all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. This discussion is limited to consequences relevant to a U.S. Holder (as defined below). This discussion does not address the impact of the U.S. federal Medicare tax on net investment income, the effects of alternative minimum tax or the effects of any U.S. federal tax laws other than U.S. federal income tax laws (such as estate and gift tax laws) or any state, local or non-U.S. tax laws. No rulings from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) have been or are expected to be sought with respect to the matters discussed below. There can be no assurance that the IRS will not take a different position concerning the tax consequences of the purchase, ownership or disposition of the Notes, or that any such position would not be sustained by a court. This discussion does not address all of the U.S. federal income tax consequences that may be relevant to a holder in light of such holder’s particular circumstances or to holders subject to special rules, such as banks or other financial institutions, U.S. expatriates or entities subject to the U.S. anti-inversion rules, insurance companies, dealers in securities or currencies, traders in securities, U.S. Holders whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, tax-exempt entities and organizations, retirement and other tax deferred accounts, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, holders subject to special tax accounting rules as a result of any item of gross income with respect to the Notes being taken into account in an applicable financial statement, partnerships or other pass-through entities (or investors in such entities), persons holding Notes that are attributable to an office or other fixed place of business maintained outside of the United States, persons who hold Existing Notes that are redeemed pursuant to the Existing Notes Redemption, and persons holding the Notes as part of a “straddle,” “hedge,” “conversion transaction” or other integrated transaction or a constructive sale transaction. In addition, this discussion is limited to Notes purchased for cash at original issue and at their “issue price” (i.e., the first price at which a substantial amount of the Notes is sold for money, not including sales to bond houses, brokers or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents or wholesalers) and held as capital assets within the meaning of section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment). For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner of a Note that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, (i) an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States; (ii) a corporation created or organized under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia; (iii) an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or (iv) a trust if a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more “United States person” within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code (“U.S. Person”) has the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust, or if a valid election is in place to treat the trust as a U.S. Person. If any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds the Notes, the tax treatment of a partner in the partnership generally will depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. Partnerships that are considering an investment in the Notes, and partners in such partnerships, should consult their tax advisors regarding the tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of Notes.

We intend to take the position that, as of the date of issuance, the foregoing contingencies should not cause the Notes to be treated as contingent payment debt instruments for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Our determination that the Notes are not contingent payment debt instruments is binding on a U.S. Holder, unless the U.S. Holder expressly discloses its contrary position in the manner required by applicable Treasury Regulations (generally, on its U.S. federal income tax return for the year during which the U.S. Holder acquires Notes). Our determination is not, however, binding on the IRS, and if the IRS were to challenge our position successfully, a U.S. Holder may be required to accrue interest income on its Notes at a rate in excess of the stated interest rate and to treat any gain recognized on the taxable disposition of a note as ordinary income rather than as capital gain.

Aimed at maximising efficiency and reducing cost for financial institutions, the CRS provides a common standard for due diligence, reporting and exchange of financial account information. Pursuant to the CRS, participating jurisdictions will obtain from reporting financial institutions, and automatically exchange with exchange partners on an annual basis, financial information with respect to all reportable accounts identified by financial institutions on the basis of common due diligence and reporting procedures. Jersey has committed to implement the CRS. As a result, the Issuer is required to comply with the CRS due diligence and reporting requirements, as adopted by Jersey. Broadly, these are that the due diligence requirements under the CRS framework as adopted by Jersey commenced on 1 January 2016, with information to be reported to the Jersey Taxes Office from 30 June 2017. Information exchange between Jersey Revenue and partner jurisdictions is automatic and has commenced. Noteholders may be required to provide additional information to the Issuer to enable the Issuer to satisfy its obligations under the CRS. Failure to provide requested information may subject an investor to liability for any resulting penalties or other charges and/or mandatory redemption of Notes. 445 -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,879

(5) Each holder of Notes issued in reliance on Rule 144A agrees on its own behalf and on behalf of any investor account for which it is purchasing the Notes, and each subsequent holder of the Notes (as applicable) by its acceptance thereof will be deemed to agree, to offer, sell or otherwise transfer such Notes only (i) to the Issuer, (ii) pursuant to a registration statement that has been declared effective under the U.S. Securities Act, (iii) for so long as the Notes are eligible pursuant to Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act, to a person it reasonably believes is a QIB that purchases for its own account or for the account of a QIB to whom notice is given that the transfer is being made in reliance on Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act, (iv) pursuant to offers and sales to non-U.S. persons that occur outside the United States in compliance with Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act, or (v) pursuant to any other available exemption from the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act, subject in each of the foregoing cases to any requirement of law that the disposition of its property or the property of such investor account or accounts be at all times within its or their control and in compliance with any applicable state securities laws and any applicable local laws and regulations, and further subject to the Issuer’s and the Trustee’s rights prior to any such offer, sale or transfer pursuant to clause (iv) or (v) to require the delivery of an opinion of counsel, certification and/or other information satisfactory to each of them.

Any investment or investment activity to which this offering memorandum relates is available only to relevant persons and will be engaged in only with relevant persons. Each of the initial purchasers has represented, warranted and agreed that: - it has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause to be communicated an invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of section 21 of FSMA) received by it in connection with the issue or sale of any Notes in circumstances in which section 21(1) of FSMA does not apply to the Issuer or any Guarantor; and - it has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of FSMA with respect to anything done by it in relation to any Notes in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom. This offering memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offering of the offered Notes in any Member State of the EEA or the United Kingdom will be made pursuant to an exemption under Prospectus Regulation and the UK Prospectus Regulation from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offerings of securities. This offering memorandum is not a prospectus for purposes of the Prospectus Regulation. This offering memorandum is not a prospectus for the purposes of the Prospectus Regulation or the UK Prospectus Regulation. No action has been taken in any jurisdiction, including the United States and the United Kingdom, by us or the initial purchasers that would permit a public offering of the Notes or the possession, circulation or distribution of this offering memorandum or any other material relating to us or the Notes in any jurisdiction where action for this purpose is required. Accordingly, the Notes may not be offered or sold, directly or indirectly, and neither this offering memorandum nor any other offering material or advertisements in connection with the Notes may be distributed or published, in or from any country or jurisdiction, except in compliance with any applicable rules and regulations of any such country or jurisdiction. This offering memorandum does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase in any jurisdiction where such offer or solicitation would be unlawful. Persons into whose possession this offering memorandum comes are advised to inform themselves about and to observe any restrictions relating to the offering of the Notes, the distribution of this offering memorandum and resale of the Notes. See “Notice to Investors.” The Issuer and the Guarantors have also agreed that they will not at any time offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, any securities under circumstances in which such offer, sale, pledge, contract or disposition would cause the exemption afforded by Section 4(a)(2) of the U.S. Securities Act or the safe harbors of Rule 144A and Regulation S to cease to be applicable to the offer and sale of the Notes. The Notes are new issues of securities for which there currently is no market. The Issuer will apply, through its listing agent, to list the Notes on the Exchange and trade the Notes on the Official List thereof. There can be no assurance that the Notes will be listed or traded on the Official List of the Exchange or that such listing will be maintained. 447 ----- Certain initial purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market in the Notes as permitted by applicable law. The initial purchasers are not obligated, however, to make a market in the Notes, and any market-making activity may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the initial purchasers without notice. In addition, any such market-making activity will be subject to the limits imposed by the U.S. Securities Act and the U.S. Exchange Act. Accordingly, the Issuer cannot assure you that any market for the Notes will develop, that it will be liquid if it does develop or that you will be able to sell any Notes at a particular time or at a price which will be favorable to you. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Note Guarantees and the _Collateral—There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes may be limited.”_ In connection with the Offering, the initial purchasers may purchase and sell the Notes in the open market. These transactions may include short sales and purchases on the open market to cover positions created by short sales. Short sales involve the sale by the initial purchasers of a greater principal amount of Notes than they are required to purchase in the Offering. The initial purchasers must close out any short position by purchasing Notes in the open market. A short position is more likely to be created if the initial purchasers are concerned that there may be downward pressure on the price of the Notes in the open market after pricing that could adversely affect investors who purchase in the Offering. Similar to other purchase transactions, the initial purchasers’ purchases to cover the syndicate short sales may have the effect of raising or maintaining the market price of the Notes or preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of the Notes. As a result, the price of the Notes may be higher than the price that might otherwise exist in the open market. Neither we nor any of the initial purchasers make any representation or prediction as to the direction or magnitude of any effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of the Notes. In addition, neither we nor any of the initial purchasers make any representation that these transactions will be engaged in or that these transactions, once commenced, will not be discontinued without notice. The Issuer expects that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment on the Notes on or about the date specified on the cover page of this offering memorandum, which will be     business days (as such term is used for purposes of Rule 15c6-1 of the U.S. Exchange Act) and    business days in the United Kingdom following the date of pricing of the Notes (this settlement cycle is being referred to as “T +  ”). Under Rule 15c6-1 of the U.S. Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes on the date of this offering memorandum or on the next    successive business days will be required to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who wish to make such trades should consult their own advisors. The initial purchasers or their respective affiliates from time to time have provided in the past and may provide in the future investment banking, commercial purpose lending, transaction and clearing services, consulting and financial advisory services to us and our affiliates in the ordinary course of business for which they may receive customary advisory and transaction fees and expense reimbursement. Certain of the initial purchasers may from time to time also enter into swap and other derivative transactions with us and our affiliates. In addition, in the ordinary course of their business activities, the initial purchasers and their affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers. Such investments and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of the Ardonagh Group or Ardonagh Group’s affiliates. If the initial purchasers or their affiliates have a lending relationship with the Issuer or its affiliates, certain of those initial purchasers 448 ----- or their affiliates may routinely hedge, certain of those initial purchasers or their affiliates are likely to hedge, and certain of those initial purchasers or their affiliates may hedge their credit exposure to the Issuer and/or its affiliates consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, such initial purchasers and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions that consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in securities, including potentially the Notes offered in the Offering. Any such short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of Notes offered in the Offering. The initial purchasers and their affiliates may also make investment recommendations or publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long or short positions in such securities and instruments. Certain initial purchasers or their respective affiliates are lenders under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility, which will be amended and/or restated as part of the Transactions. Certain initial purchasers or their respective affiliates will be lenders under the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities. 449 -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,879

Depending on market conditions, certain of the initial purchasers may decide to initially purchase and hold a portion of the Notes for their own accounts. After the initial offering of the Notes, the initial purchasers may change the prices at which the Notes are offered and any other selling terms at any time without notice. Certain of the initial purchasers may offer and sell the Notes through one or more of their respective affiliates, or other registered broker-dealers or selling agents. To the extent that any initial purchaser that is not a U.S. registered broker dealer intends to effect any sales of Notes in the United States, it will do so through one or more U.S. registered broker dealer affiliates as permitted by guidelines promulgated by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. The materials relating to the Offering do not constitute, and may not be used in connection with an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy, nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any place where such offers, solicitations or sales are not permitted by law. If a jurisdiction requires that the Offering be made by a licensed broker or dealer and the initial purchasers or any affiliate of the Initial Purchasers is a licensed broker dealer in that jurisdiction, the Offering shall be deemed to be made by the initial purchasers or such affiliate on behalf of the Issuer in such jurisdiction. The Sponsors or their respective affiliates may place a purchase order for and be allocated the Notes at a purchase price per Note equal to the issue price set forth on the cover page of this Offering Memorandum. The Purchase Agreement provides that the obligations of the initial purchasers to pay for and accept delivery of the Notes are subject to, among other conditions, the delivery of certain legal opinions by their counsel and our counsel. The Purchase Agreement provides that the Issuer and each of the Guarantors will indemnify and hold harmless the initial purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the U.S. Securities Act, and will contribute to payments that the initial purchasers may be required to make in respect thereof.

Consequently, a final judgment for payment rendered by any federal or state court in the United States based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws, would not automatically be recognized or enforceable in Jersey or England. In order to enforce any such U.S. judgment in Jersey or England, proceedings must first be initiated before a court of competent jurisdiction in Jersey or England. In such an action, the Jersey or English courts would not generally reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by the U.S. court (subject to what is stated below) and it would usually be possible to obtain summary judgment on such a claim (assuming that there is no good defense to it). Recognition and enforcement of a U.S. judgment by a Jersey or English court in such an action is conditional upon (among other things) the following: - the U.S. court having had jurisdiction over the original proceedings according to the Jersey and English conflicts of laws principles (as applicable); - the U.S. judgment being final and conclusive on the merits in the sense of being final and unalterable in the court which pronounced it and being for a debt for a definite sum of money; - the U.S. judgment not contravening Jersey or English public policy (as applicable); - the U.S. judgment not being for a sum payable in respect of tax, or other charges of a like nature in respect of a penalty or fine; - within English courts, the U.S. judgment not having been arrived at by doubling, trebling or otherwise multiplying a sum assessed as compensation for the loss or damages sustained and not being otherwise in breach of Section 5 of the Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980 of English Law as extended to Jersey by the Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980 (Jersey) Order 1983); - the U.S. judgment not having been obtained by fraud or in breach of Jersey or English principles of natural justice (as applicable); - judgment is not given in proceedings brought in breach of an agreement for settlement of disputes; - there not having been a prior inconsistent decision of a Jersey or English court between the same parties; and - the English enforcement proceedings being commenced within six years from the date of the U.S. judgment. 453 ----- Subject to the foregoing, investors may be able to enforce in Jersey or England (as applicable) judgments in civil and commercial matters that have been obtained from U.S. federal or state courts. Nevertheless, there can be no assurance that those judgments will be recognized or enforceable in either Jersey or England. In addition, it is questionable whether either a Jersey or English court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability if the original action was commenced in Jersey or England, respectively, instead of the United States, and predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws.",N/A,as_expected,2024,879

As a result, it may be difficult for investors to enforce judgments obtained in non-Dutch courts against the Dutch Guarantor. The Netherlands does not currently have a treaty with the United States providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments (other than arbitration awards) in civil and commercial matters. Therefore, a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any court in any federal or state court in the United States based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon United States federal securities laws, would not be recognized or enforceable in The Netherlands. In order to obtain a judgment which is enforceable in The Netherlands the claim must be relitigated before a competent Dutch court and the judgment rendered by the non-Dutch court must be submitted in the course of such proceedings, in which case the Dutch court will have to decide whether and to what extent, given the circumstances of the case, it will recognize the foreign judgment. The relevant Dutch court has discretion to attach such weight to a judgment of a U.S. Court as it deems appropriate. A Dutch court will, under current practice, generally grant the same judgment without relitigation on the merits if (a) the foreign judgment results from proceedings compatible with the Dutch concept of due process (behoorlijke en met voldoende waarborgen omklede rechtspleging), (b) recognition of the foreign judgment does not contravene public policy (openbare orde) of The Netherlands, (c) the jurisdiction of the foreign court that has rendered the foreign judgment has been based on an internationally recognized ground to accept jurisdiction and (d) the foreign judgment is not incompatible with a judgment rendered between the same parties by a Dutch court, or with an earlier judgment rendered between the same parties by a foreign court in a dispute that concerns the same subject and is based on the same cause, provided that such earlier judgment qualifies for recognition in The Netherlands. Subject to the foregoing and service of process in accordance with applicable treaties, investors may be able to enforce in the Netherlands judgments in civil and commercial matters obtained from U.S. federal or state courts. However, no assurance can be given that those judgments will be enforceable. In addition, it is uncertain whether a Dutch court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability in an original action commenced in the Netherlands and predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws. Moreover, a Dutch court may reduce the amount of damages granted by a U.S. court and recognize damages only to the extent that they are necessary to compensate actual losses or damages.

Consequently, a final judgment for payment rendered by any federal or state court in the United States based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws, would not automatically be recognized or enforceable in Jersey. In order to enforce any such U.S. judgment in Jersey, proceedings must first be initiated before a court of competent jurisdiction in Jersey. In such an action, the Royal Court would not generally reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by the U.S. court (subject to what is said below) and it would usually be possible to obtain summary 454 ----- judgment on such a claim (assuming that there is no good defense to it). Recognition and enforcement of a U.S. judgment by the Royal Court in such an action is conditional upon (among other things) the following: - the U.S. court having had jurisdiction over the original proceedings according to Jersey conflicts of laws principles; - the U.S. judgment being final and conclusive on the merits in the sense of being final and unalterable in the court which pronounced it and being for a debt or definite sum of money (although there are circumstances where non-money judgments may also be recognized); - the recognition or enforcement of the U.S. judgment not contravening Jersey public policy, including that the judgment was not obtained by fraud or duress and the observance of the principles of natural justice which require, among other things, that documents in the US proceedings were properly served on the defendant and that the defendant was given the right to be heard and represented by counsel in a free and fair trial before an important tribunal; - the U.S. judgment not being for a sum payable in respect of taxes, or other charges of a like nature, or in respect of a penalty or fine; - the U.S. judgment not having been arrived at by doubling, trebling or otherwise multiplying a sum assessed as compensation for the loss or damages sustained and not being otherwise in breach of Section 5 of the United Kingdom Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980 (as extended to Jersey by the Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980 (Jersey) Order 1983); and - there not having been a prior inconsistent decision of a Jersey court in respect of the same matter.

No assurance can be given that judgments of a United States court will be enforceable in Australia. In addition, no assurance can be made as to whether or not an Australian court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability in an original action commenced in Australia and predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws. Generally, foreign judgments can be enforced in Australia by registering the judgment under the _Foreign Judgments Act 1991 (Cth). This regime is based on reciprocity of enforcement and only foreign_ judgments issued by courts or countries set out in the Foreign Judgments Regulations 1992 (Cth) may be registered. There are no reciprocal arrangements between Australia and the United States, and accordingly, judgments obtained from a New York court (or courts in another United States jurisdiction) cannot be registered and enforced under the Foreign Judgments Act 1991 (Cth). 455 ----- To enforce such a judgment in Australia, the judgment creditor will need to bring fresh proceedings at common law either relying on the foreign judgment as creating a debt, or bringing a cause of action based on the original cause of action relying on the foreign judgment to estop the judgment creditor from raising any defense. To be recognized and enforced in Australia, a U.S. judgment must satisfy the following conditions: - the U.S. judgment must be final and conclusive, in that it must end the proceeding and the dispute to which the proceeding relates and the matter was not the subject of an earlier final and conclusive judgment by another court having jurisdiction; - the U.S. judgment must be for a fixed or readily ascertainable sum and not in the nature of a tax, fine or penalty; - the parties to the U.S. judgment must be identical to the parties to the Australian enforcement proceeding; - the U.S. court awarding the judgment had jurisdiction over the judgment debtor at the time of exercising jurisdiction, and this jurisdiction must be recognized under Australian conflict of law rules – this requirement will usually be satisfied where the judgment debtor was ordinarily resident or present in the U.S. at the time the proceeding was served, or otherwise voluntarily submitted to the jurisdiction of the U.S. court; - the U.S. judgment is not in respect of taxes, a foreign revenue debt or a penalty/fine imposed by U.S. (or any foreign) law; - the U.S. judgment must not be wholly satisfied (and enforcement must only be sought to the extent the judgment is not satisfied); and - the enforcement proceeding must have been commenced within any applicable limitation periods. The party bringing the application must advance sufficient evidence of these elements. A judgment debtor may seek to defend the enforcement of a U.S. judgment on the basis that either: - the U.S. judgment was obtained by fraud or duress; - the U.S. judgment is contrary to Australian public policy or general principles of fairness; - the judgment debtor was denied natural justice before the U.S. court (for example, if they did not receive notice of the proceedings in sufficient time to enable them to defend the case); - enforcement of the U.S. judgment in Australia would amount to the enforcement of a U.S. penal or revenue law; or - there is a prior judgment in another court between the same parties concerning the same issues as are dealt with in the U.S. judgment. The Australian Attorney General may also make a declaration under the Foreign Proceedings (Excess of Jurisdiction) Act 1984 (Cth)_ in respect of a U.S. judgment in relation to anti-trust proceedings, resulting in the judgment not being enforceable in Australia or enforceable only in respect of an amount less than the amount of the U.S. judgment as specified by the Australian Attorney General.",N/A,as_expected,2024,879

For such a foreign judgment to be enforced in the Cayman Islands, such judgment must be final and conclusive and for a liquidated sum, and must not be in respect of taxes or a fine or penalty, inconsistent with a Cayman Islands judgment in respect of the same matter, impeachable on the grounds of fraud or obtained in a manner, and or be of a kind the enforcement of which is, contrary to natural justice or the public policy of the Cayman Islands (awards of punitive or multiple damages may well be held to be contrary to public policy).

Therefore, any insolvency proceedings by or against the English Obligors would likely be based on English insolvency laws. However, as discussed in the European Union section below, pursuant to the** **EU** Insolvency Regulation, as amended by the Insolvency (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (SI 2019/146) (as amended), where a company incorporated under English law has its COMI in a Member State of the European Union other than Denmark, any main insolvency proceedings for that company would, subject to certain exceptions, be opened in the Member State in which its COMI is located and be, subject to certain exceptions set out in Articles 8 to 18 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, subject to the laws of that Member State. Similarly, the Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations 2006 (SI 2006/1030) and the Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2007 (2007 No. 115), which implement the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency in the United Kingdom, provide that a foreign (i.e., nonEnglish) court may have jurisdiction where any English company has its **COMI in such foreign jurisdiction, or where it has an “establishment” (being a place of operations in such foreign jurisdiction, where it carries out non-transitory economic activities with human means and assets or services). Although the scope of the English courts’ jurisdiction varies for the different insolvency proceedings available in England and Wales, English courts generally have jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings in respect of any company which has its COMI in the UK or which has its COMI in an EU member state (other than Denmark) and an “establishment” in the UK. While this allows English courts to assume jurisdiction over certain foreign companies in respect of certain insolvency proceedings, the efficacy of such proceedings will significantly depend on the likelihood and extent of subsequent recognition of such proceedings in relevant other jurisdictions. The recognition of English courts’ jurisdiction and orders in respect of schemes of arrangement and restructuring plan processes, which are restructuring rather than insolvency proceedings, will be subject to treaties regarding matters relating to the jurisdiction of courts in civil proceedings and the enforcement of civil judgments such as the Hague Convention on Choice of Court Agreements 2005 and the Lugano Convention 2007 (subject to the UK’s pending accession to the latter) where these apply. In addition, recognition may still be available under principles of private international law and (in the case of EU member states other than Denmark) Regulation (EC) No 593/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 June 2008 on the law applicable to contractual obligations (“Rome",N/A,as_expected,2024,879

Rome I was incorporated with minor amendments into English law pursuant to The Law Applicable,1447.2.1,Recognition in the EU,"Following the UK’s departure from the EU and the expiry of the Transition Period, UK proceedings no longer benefit from automatic and guaranteed recognition in EU member states. As the trade and cooperation terms agreed between the EU and the UK do not include a regime for the automatic recognition of UK insolvency procedures across the EU (and vice versa) or otherwise address insolvency matters, cross-border insolvencies involving the UK and one or more EU member states are subject to a degree of uncertainty and increased complexity. As a result, it may be more problematic for UK restructuring and insolvency proceedings to be recognized in EU member states and for UK office holders to effectively deal with assets located in EU member states than it was during and prior to the Transition Period. The general position outlined above will apply and recognition will depend on the private international law rules adopted in the relevant EU member state. It may be necessary to open parallel proceedings, increasing the element of risk as well as costs. In particular in cases where the appointment of a UK office holder is made in reliance on a UK domestic approach rather than COMI rules, it is much less certain that such appointment will be recognized in EU member states. To the extent relevant proceedings are deemed to fall within the remit of contract law, Rome I may offer an alternative basis for recognition in EU member states other than Denmark. As a consequence, the recognition of English insolvency and restructuring proceedings across the EU member states may be different from what investors may have experienced in the past when the UK was a member state of the EU or during the Transition Period. It is not possible to predict with certainty if and to what extent proceedings will be recognized and whether investors may be adversely affected as a result.",N/A,as_expected,2024,879
1923_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,1447,CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS,1447.2,I”). Rome I was incorporated with minor amendments into English law pursuant to The Law Applicable,1447.2.2,Administration,"Under the Insolvency Act 1986 (the “Insolvency Act”), it is possible for a qualified insolvency practitioner to be appointed as an administrator of (i) a company registered under the Companies Act 2006 in England and Wales or Scotland, (ii) a company incorporated in a member state of the European Economic Area or (iii) a company not incorporated in a member state of the European Economic Area but having its COMI in an EU member state (other than Denmark) or in the UK. A court order is not necessarily required for such an appointment. Subject to specific conditions, a court can make an administration order if the court is satisfied that the relevant company is or is likely to become “unable to pay its debts” and that the administration order is reasonably likely to achieve the purpose of administration. Pursuant to section 123 of the Insolvency Act a company is unable to pay its debts if it is insolvent on a “cash flow” basis (unable to pay its debts as they fall due) or if it is insolvent on a “balance sheet” basis (the value of the company’s assets is less than the amount of its liabilities, taking into account its contingent and prospective liabilities). Such insolvency is presumed if, among other matters, the company fails either to satisfy a creditor’s statutory demand for a debt exceeding £750 within 21 days of service or to satisfy in full or in part a judgment 460 ----- debt (or similar court order). Without limitation and subject to specific conditions, an English company, the directors of such company or the holder of a qualifying floating charge in respect of the company’s property (discussed below), where the floating charge has become enforceable, may also appoint an administrator out of court. If the appointor holds a qualifying floating charge in respect of the company’s property, there is no requirement that the company is or is likely to become unable to pay its debts. The purpose of an administration is comprised of three objectives that must be looked at successively: rescuing the company as a going concern or, if that is not reasonably practicable, achieving a better result for the company’s creditors as a whole than would be likely upon immediate liquidation or, if neither of those objectives is reasonably practicable, and the interests of the creditors as a whole are not unnecessarily harmed thereby, realizing property to make a distribution to one or more secured or preferential creditors. The rights of creditors, including secured creditors, are curtailed in an administration pursuant to the statutory moratorium imposed under the Insolvency Act. Upon the appointment of an administrator, no step may be taken to enforce security over the company’s property except with the consent of the administrator or permission of the court. The same requirements for consent or permission apply to the institution or continuation of legal process (including legal proceedings, execution, distress and diligence) against the company or property of the company. In either case, a court will consider discretionary factors in determining any application for leave in light of the hierarchy of statutory objectives of administration described above. Accordingly, if any of the Issuer, the Guarantors or the providers of Collateral were to enter administration, the Notes, the Note Guarantees and the Collateral, as applicable, could not be enforced against that company while it was in administration without the permission of the court or consent of the administrator. There can be no assurance that the Trustee, or the Security Agent, as applicable, would obtain this permission of the court or consent of the administrator. In addition, while an administrator is in office, the powers of the directors of the relevant company cease (save for those powers that do not interfere with the exercise of the administrator’s powers, and those permitted by the administrator) and the administrator has primary responsibility for managing the company’s affairs. An administrator is given wide powers to conduct the business of the company to which he or she is appointed and, subject to certain requirements under the Insolvency Act, dispose of the property of a company in administration, including property subject to a floating charge. In the case of property subject to a fixed charge, an administrator has no power to dispose of that property clear of the fixed charge without the agreement of the relevant charge holder or a court order. Such a court order is discretionary and may be made only where the court thinks the disposal would be likely to promote the purpose of administration. If such an order is made, it will be conditional upon the administrator applying the net proceeds of the disposal, together with any additional sum required to produce the net amount the court determines would be realised on a sale at a market value, towards discharging the sums secured by the fixed charge. The administrator also has the ability to challenge certain antecedent transactions. However, the general prohibition against enforcement by secured creditors without consent of the administrator or permission of the court, and the administrator’s powers with respect to property subject to a floating charge, does not apply to any security interest created or arising under a financial collateral arrangement within the meaning of the Financial Collateral Agreements (No. 2) Regulations 2003 (SI 2003/3226) (U.K.) (the “Financial Collateral Regulations”). A financial collateral arrangement includes (subject to certain other conditions) a security interest over financial collateral (including a floating charge, a pledge, a mortgage, a fixed charge or a lien) in a company, where both the collateral provider and collateral taker are non-natural persons. If an arrangement qualifies as a financial collateral arrangement under the Financial Collateral Regulations certain modifications or exclusions to English insolvency law apply which remove restrictions on enforcing security, disapply provisions relating to 461 ----- the order of payment of creditors and prohibit avoidance by the insolvency office-holder of the financial collateral arrangement in certain situations.",N/A,as_expected,2024,879

In order to constitute a qualifying floating charge for these purposes, the floating charge must be created by an instrument which (a) states that the relevant statutory provision applies to it; or (b) purports to empower the holder to appoint an administrator of the company. A party will be the holder of a qualifying floating charge if it holds one or more debentures of the company secured: (a) by a qualifying floating charge which relates to the whole or substantially the whole of the company’s property; (b) by a number of qualifying floating charges which together relate to the whole or substantially the whole of the company’s property; or (c) by charges and other forms of security which together relate to the whole or substantially the whole of the company’s property and at least one of which is a qualifying floating charge. If an administrative receiver has been appointed, an administrator can only be appointed by the court (and not by the company, its directors or the holder of a qualifying charge using the out of court procedure) and then only if the person who appointed the administrative receiver consents or the court considers that the security pursuant to which the administrative receiver was appointed is invalid. If an administrator is appointed, any administrative receiver will vacate office, and any receiver of part of the company’s property must resign if required to do so by the administrator.",N/A,as_expected,2024,879

Rome I was incorporated with minor amendments into English law pursuant to The Law Applicable,1447.2.4,Fixed charge receivership,"A fixed charge receiver (as opposed to an administrative receiver) may be appointed over some or all of the assets secured by a fixed charge in accordance with the terms of a security document creating a fixed charge or (in limited circumstances) pursuant to statute. If appointed under the terms of a security agreement, grounds for appointment under the terms of the charge (such as a default) must exist and the charging company must have failed to satisfy the demand made for an appointment to take place. A fixed charge receiver can be appointed in parallel to a liquidator. An administrator may require a fixed charge receiver to vacate office unless that fixed charge receiver was appointed under a charge which falls within the definition of a “security financial collateral arrangement”, as per regulation 8(4) of the Financial Collateral Regulations. The primary duty of the fixed charge receiver is to realize the assets over which (s)he is appointed, meaning (s)he owes an over-riding duty of care to the appointor. This contrasts with the duty of an administrator, who performs their duties in the interests of a company’s creditors as a whole. In other words, receivership is a proprietary remedy whereas administration is a collective procedure. In realizing the charged assets, the receiver will need to take reasonable care to obtain the best price obtainable in the circumstances. In doing so, the fixed charge receiver will be entitled to a statutory indemnity in respect of any liabilities from the realizations made of the assets of the company (and may also have the benefit of a contractual indemnity from the appointor). To the extent the receiver has been appointed under a crystallized floating charge, amounts will be deducted from the proceeds of the realization of the charged assets to pay the Prescribed Part and any preferential creditors (see “Priority on insolvency” below). There is no moratorium in a fixed charge receivership, so creditors can enforce any rights that are consistent with the priority of the security, including exercising rights of set-off and forfeiture, collecting goods that are subject to valid retention of title claims and, subject to certain Insolvency Act limitations on the effectiveness of ipso facto clauses where applicable, terminating contracts. 462 ----- If a company is already in administration, the moratorium on creditor action will prevent the appointment of a fixed charge receiver unless the administrator consents or the court permits the appointment, or an exception to the moratorium applies.",N/A,as_expected,2024,879

Rome I was incorporated with minor amendments into English law pursuant to The Law Applicable,1447.2.5,Liquidation/winding-up,"Liquidation is a company dissolution procedure under which the assets of a company are realized and distributed by the liquidator to creditors and (if applicable) members in the statutory order of priority prescribed by the Insolvency Act. Once the liquidator has completed this task, the company is dissolved and removed from the register of companies. There are two forms of winding-up: (i) compulsory liquidation, by order of the court; and (ii) voluntary liquidation, by resolution of the company’s members, and which is in turn divided into members’ voluntary liquidation (“MVL”) and creditors’ voluntary liquidation (“CVL”). The primary ground for the compulsory winding-up of an insolvent company is that it is unable to pay its debts (as described above). Companies registered in England and Wales or foreign companies with their COMI in England and Wales, with their COMI in an EU member state (other than Denmark) and an “establishment” in England and Wales or which have a “sufficient connection” with England and Wales to justify the court exercising its jurisdiction may be wound up via compulsory liquidation. Only companies registered in England and Wales may be subject to voluntary liquidation (save that a foreign company where its COMI is in England and Wales or in an EU member state (except Denmark) but which has an “establishment” in England and Wales may enter a creditors’ voluntary liquidation). A creditor, the company or in certain circumstances a shareholder, among others, can present a windingup petition to the Court for the compulsory winding-up of a company. The most common grounds for the compulsory winding up of a company is that either it is unable to pay its debts (as defined in Section 123 of the Insolvency Act) or the court is of the opinion that it is just and equitable for the company to be wound up. The effect of a compulsory winding-up differs in a number of respects from that of a voluntary windingup. In a compulsory winding-up, under section 127 of the Insolvency Act, any disposition of the relevant company’s property made after the commencement of the winding-up is, unless sanctioned by the court, void. However, this will not apply to any property or security interest subject to a disposition or otherwise arising under a financial collateral arrangement under the Financial Collateral Regulations and will not prevent a close-out netting provision taking effect in accordance with its terms. Subject to certain exceptions, when an order is made for the winding-up of a company by the court, it is deemed to have commenced from the time of the presentation of the winding-up petition. Once a winding-up order is made by the court, a stay of all proceedings against the company will be imposed. No legal action may be continued or commenced against the company without permission of the court. In the context of a voluntary winding-up however, there is no equivalent to the retrospective effect of a winding up order; the winding up commences on the passing of the resolution to wind up. As a result, there is no equivalent of section 127 of the Insolvency Act for a voluntary winding-up. There is also no automatic stay in the case of a voluntary winding-up—it is for the liquidator, or any creditor or shareholder of the company, to apply for a stay. This is important because, in the absence of a stay being obtained, it means secured creditors for example can go ahead and enforce their security. A MVL is a solvent liquidation that is controlled by the shareholders. It commences when the shareholders pass a special resolution to place the company into liquidation and there is no involvement by the court. Not more than five weeks prior to the making of the winding up resolution, the directors must swear a statutory declaration of solvency stating that, after having made full enquiry into the company’s affairs, they have formed the opinion that it will be able to pay its debts, including interest and the costs of the MVL process, within a stated period not exceeding 12 months from the start of the liquidation. 463 ----- A CVL is also commenced by the shareholders resolving to place the company into liquidation and has no court involvement. In contrast to an MVL, however, the directors do not swear a statutory declaration of solvency for a CVL (meaning the company can be solvent or insolvent). If the creditors choose a different person to act as liquidator from the shareholders, the creditors’ choice will prevail. On the appointment of a liquidator, the directors’ powers to bind the company automatically cease, save for those powers that are sanctioned by the liquidator or creditors (as appropriate). A liquidator has, among other things, the power to bring or defend legal proceedings on behalf of the company, to carry on the business of the company as far as it is necessary for its beneficial winding up, to sell the company’s property (provided that in respect of the sale of any property that is secured by a fixed charge in favour of a creditor, if that sale is made without the secured creditor’s consent, it will be made subject to that security, as the creditor’s consent will be needed to the release of the security),execute documents in the name of the company and to challenge antecedent transactions.",N/A,as_expected,2024,879

Unless creditors have agreed otherwise, distributions are made on a _pari passu basis, that is, the assets are distributed in proportion to the debts due to each creditor within a class. The general priority on insolvency is as follows (in descending order of priority) and subject to certain circumstances in which super priority is afforded to moratorium debts and priority pre-moratorium debts in accordance with Section 174A of the Insolvency Act and paragraph 64A of Schedule B1 of the Insolvency Act (see “Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020” below): - First ranking: holders of fixed charge security (but only to the extent the value of the secured assets covers that indebtedness) and creditors with a proprietary interest in assets in the possession (but not full legal and beneficial ownership) of the debtor but only with respect to the assets in which they have a proprietary interest; - Second ranking: expenses of the insolvent estate incurred during the relevant insolvency proceedings (there are statutory provisions setting out the order of priority in which expenses are paid); - Third ranking: preferential creditors. Ordinary preferential debts include (but are not limited to) debts owed by the insolvent company in relation to: (i) contributions to occupational and state pension schemes; (ii) wages and salaries of employees for work done in the four months before the insolvency date, up to a maximum of £800 per person; (iii) holiday pay due to any employee whose contract has been terminated, whether the termination takes place before or after the insolvency date; and (iv) bank and building deposits eligible for compensation under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (“FSCS”) up to the statutory limit. Secondary preferential debts include (i) bank and building deposits eligible for compensation under the FSCS to the extent that claims exceed the statutory limit, and rank for payment after the discharge of the ordinary preferential debts and (ii) claims by HMRC in respect of certain taxes including VAT, PAYE income tax (including student loan repayments), employee NI contributions and Construction Industry Scheme deductions (but excluding corporation tax and employer NI contributions) which are held by the company on behalf of employees and customers. As between one another, all claims within each category rank equally; - Fourth ranking: holders of floating charge security, according to the priority of their security. This would include any floating charge that was stated to be a fixed charge in the document that created it but which, on a proper interpretation, was rendered a floating charge. However, before distributing asset realizations to the holders of floating charges, the Prescribed Part (as 464 ----- defined below) must, subject to certain exceptions, be set aside for distribution to unsecured creditors; - Fifth ranking: (a) firstly, provable debts of unsecured creditors (save where such creditors are deferred under section 74(2(f)) of the Insolvency Act) and any secured creditor to the extent of any unsecured shortfall, in each case including accrued and unpaid interest on those debts up to the date of commencement of the relevant insolvency proceedings. These debts rank equally among themselves unless there are subordination agreements in place between any of them. To pay the secured creditors any unsecured shortfall, the insolvency officeholder can only use realizations from unsecured assets, as secured creditors are not entitled to any distribution from the Prescribed Part unless the Prescribed Part is sufficient to pay out all unsecured creditors; (b) secondly, interest on the company’s unsubordinated debts (at the higher of the applicable contractual rate and the official rate) in respect of any period after the commencement of liquidation, or after the commencement of any administration which either preceded such liquidation or which were converted into a liquidating administration. However, in the case of interest accruing on amounts due under the Notes or the Note Guarantees, such interest due to the holders of the Notes may, if there are sufficient realizations from the secured assets, be discharged out of such security recoveries; and (c) thirdly, non-provable liabilities, being liabilities that do not fall within any of the categories above and therefore are only recovered in the (unusual) event that all categories above are fully paid. - Sixth ranking: shareholders. If after the repayment of all unsecured creditors in full, any remaining funds exist, these will be distributed to the shareholders of the insolvent company. Subordinated creditors are ranked according to the terms of the subordination (and provided that such terms do not contravene the Insolvency Act). An insolvency practitioner of a company will generally be required to ring-fence a certain percentage of the proceeds of enforcement of floating charge security for the benefit of unsecured creditors (after making full provision for preferential creditors and expenses out of floating charge realizations) (the “Prescribed Part”). This ring-fence applies to 50% of the first £10,000 of floating charge realizations and 20% of the remainder over £10,000, with a maximum aggregate cap of £800,000 (except where the company’s net property is available to be distributed to the holder of a first-ranking floating charge created before 6 April 2020, in which case the maximum aggregate cap is £600,000). The Prescribed Part must be made available to unsecured creditors unless the cost of doing so would be disproportionate to the resulting benefit to creditors. The requirement for an administrator, liquidator or receiver (including administrative receiver) to set aside a Prescribed Part of the company's property which is subject to a floating charge, and make it available for unsecured creditors, will not apply to any charge created or otherwise arising under a financial collateral arrangement (as described in the Financial Collateral Regulations).",N/A,as_expected,2024,879

A “connected person” of a company granting a security interest or guarantee for the purposes of transactions at an undervalue, preferences or invalid floating charges is a party who is: (a) a director of the company; (b) a shadow director; (c) an associate of such director or shadow director; or (d) an associate of the relevant company. The term “associate” is very widely defined; key “associates” are defined below. A party is an associate of an individual if they are: (a) a relative of the individual; (b) the individual’s husband, wife or civil partner; (c) a relative of the individual’s husband, wife or civil partner; or (d) the husband, wife or civil partner of a relative of the individual or the individual’s husband, wife or civil partner. A person is an associate of any person with whom he is in partnership and of the husband, wife or civil partner or relative of any individual with whom he is in partnership. A party is associated with a company if they are employed by that company (and in this case directors of a company are treated as employees of that company). A person is also an associate of any person whom he employs. A company is an associate of another person if that person has control of it or if that person and persons who are his associates together have control of it. A company is associated with another company if the same person has control of both companies, or a person has control of one and persons who are his associates, or he and persons who are his associates, have control of the other, or if a group of two or more persons has control of each company, and the groups either consist of the same persons or could be regarded as consisting of the same persons by treating (in one or more cases) a member of either group as replaced by a person of whom he is an associate.

The courts have interpreted the desire to prefer on the part of the company as requiring a “positive wish to improve the creditor’s position in the event of the company’s insolvent liquidation” (Re Fairway Magazines Ltd [1993] BCLC 643).

It is not necessary for the company to be in insolvency proceedings and unlike a transaction at an undervalue or a preference, the claim is not restricted to the officeholder. This provision may be used by any person who claims to be a “victim” of the transaction (with the leave of the court if the company is in liquidation or administration) and is not therefore limited to liquidators or administrators and, subject to certain conditions, the UK Financial Conduct Authority and the UK Pensions Regulator. The Insolvency Act also does not prescribe a set time limit within which to bring the action. The fact that the transaction was not entered into with a dishonest motive is no defense to the claim.

Whether the purported fixed security interests will be upheld as fixed security interests rather than floating security interests will depend, among other things, on whether the secured party has the requisite degree of control over the chargor’s ability to deal in the relevant assets and the proceeds thereof and, if so, whether such control is exercised by the security holder in practice. Where the chargor is free to deal with the assets that are the subject of a purported fixed charge in its discretion and without the consent of the chargee, the court would be likely to hold that the security interest in question constitutes a floating charge, notwithstanding that it may be described as a fixed charge. While recharacterization is a risk for all attempts to create fixed security, it is a particular risk in relation to attempts to create fixed security over receivables. This is because even if a company purports to grant fixed security over its receivables, it will likely retain, in practice, the ability to deal with its receivables in its discretion and without the consent of the chargee. If any fixed security interests are recharacterized as floating security interests, the claims of (i) any unsecured creditors of the relevant English Obligor in respect of that part of the chargor’s net property which is ring fenced (see explanation about ring fencing above); and (ii) certain statutorily defined preferential creditors of the chargor may have priority over the rights of the Security Agent to the proceeds of enforcement of such security.

To the extent that the above do not allow such an action, there is the risk that the grant of the guarantee and the subsequent security can be found to be void and the respective creditor’s rights unenforceable. Some comfort may be obtained for third parties if they are dealing with an English Obligor in good faith, however the relevant legislation is not without difficulties in its interpretation. Further, corporate benefit must be established for each English Obligor in question by virtue of entering into the proposed 470 ----- transaction. Section 172 of the Companies Act 2006 provides that a director must act in the way that he considers, in good faith, would be most likely to promote the success of the English Obligor for the benefit of its members as a whole.

Section 172(3) of the Companies Act 2006 additionally provides that a director’s general duty (as described above) is subject to any enactment or rule of law requiring directors, in certain circumstances, to consider or act in the interests of the creditors of the company.

Like a Scheme, a Restructuring Plan is available to any company that is liable to be wound up under the Insolvency Act, excluding certain financial market participants and any other company excluded by the Secretary of State. The company must: (i) have encountered, or be likely to encounter, financial difficulties that are affecting, or will or may affect, its ability to carry on business as a going concern; and (ii) have proposed a compromise or arrangement with its creditors or members (or any class of them) for the purpose of eliminating, reducing, preventing or mitigating the effect of such financial difficulties. There is no financial eligibility criteria other than the financial difficulties test mentioned in (i) above, thereby making the Restructuring Plan procedure available to both solvent and insolvent companies (in the latter case, the Restructuring Plan would be proposed by the incumbent insolvency practitioner). Where a convening application is made within 12 weeks after the end of the new standalone moratorium, any creditors in respect of “moratorium debts” and “priority pre-moratorium 472 ----- debts” may not participate in the vote and may not be compromised under the Restructuring Plan without their consent (see “Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020” below).

Creditors and members whose rights against the company would be affected by the Restructuring Plan must be permitted to participate in a convening meeting ordered by the court, provided that this will not apply in relation to a class of creditors or members of the company if the court is satisfied that none of the members of that class has a genuine economic interest in the company (in other words, if that class is “out of the money” under the relevant alternative for the company if the Restructuring Plan is not sanctioned). At the relevant class meetings, the Restructuring Plan will be deemed approved by a class if a number representing at least 75% in value of the class of creditors or class of members (as applicable) present and voting vote in favor of it. In contrast to a Scheme, there is no requirement that a majority in number must also vote in favor of the Restructuring Plan. Following the creditors’ or members’ meeting(s), a sanction hearing will be held. Here, the court will consider if the necessary plan requirements have been met, review the fairness of the Restructuring Plan and consider whether it is reasonable and decide whether to sanction the Restructuring Plan. The court has discretion to sanction a Restructuring Plan, even if one or more classes of creditors or members did not vote in favor of it, thereby “crammingdown” dissenting classes, if: (i) the court is satisfied that none of the members of the dissenting class would be any worse off under the Restructuring Plan than they would be in the event of the “relevant alternative” (i.e. what the court considers the most likely to occur in relation to the company if the Restructuring Plan were not sanctioned); and (ii) the Restructuring Plan has been approved by a number representing at least 75% in value of a class of creditors or members (as applicable), present and voting, who would receive a payment, or have a genuine economic interest in the company, in the event of the relevant alternative referred to in (i) above. A Restructuring Plan sanctioned by the court will be binding on all affected parties, whether they initially voted in favor of it or not. As with a Scheme, the commencement of a Restructuring Plan process does not automatically trigger a moratorium of claims or proceedings.",N/A,as_expected,2024,879

CIGA introduced some additional restructuring and insolvency procedures, including the Restructuring Plan (described above). _Moratorium_ CIGA introduced a moratorium procedure, which is available under Part A1 of the Insolvency Act to certain legal entities (subject to exclusions in Schedule ZA1 of the Insolvency Act), including companies registered in England, Wales or Scotland and unregistered companies liable to be wound up under Part 5 of the Insolvency Act, subject to certain exclusions. The moratorium’s initial duration will be for a period of 20 business days beginning with the business day after the day on which the moratorium comes into force, but this can be extended (i) by the directors without creditor consent, for a period of a further 20 business days, (ii) with creditor consent, for a total period of a year (including the initial 20 business day period), and (iii) by the court, for an unlimited period. To obtain the benefit of the moratorium, a director of the debtor must (provided that the company is not an overseas company or already subject to a winding up petition, in which case the directors must apply to the court for an order for the moratorium) file certain documents at court to certify that, in their view, the debtor is or is likely to become unable to pay its debts and a licensed insolvency practitioner must certify that, in their view, a moratorium would be likely to result in the rescue of the company as a going concern. Despite the existence of a “payment holiday” in respect of certain pre-moratorium debts which 473 ----- exists throughout the moratorium, the company will still be expected to pay certain debts incurred while the moratorium is in force under an obligation incurred before the moratorium commenced (known as “priority pre-moratorium debts”), including the costs of goods and services, employees and rent, together with all amounts falling due under loan agreements and other financial services contracts. The moratorium is not available to a company which on the date of filing (i) is a party to an agreement which is or forms part of a capital market arrangement, (ii) has incurred or, when the agreement was entered into was expected to incur, a debt of at least £10 million under the arrangement (at any time during the life of the capital market arrangement) and (iii) the arrangement involves the issue of a capital market investment. The definitions of “capital market arrangement” and “capital market investment” in Schedule ZA1 of the Insolvency Act are broad and are such that, in general terms, any company which is a party to an arrangement which involves at least £10 million of debt, the granting of security to a trustee, and the issue of a rated, listed or traded debt instrument, is excluded from being eligible for a moratorium. The Secretary of State may modify the criteria by reference to which a company otherwise eligible for a moratorium is excluded from being so eligible.",N/A,as_expected,2024,879
1923_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,1447,CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS,1447.4,Republic of Ireland,1447.4.1,,"_Insolvency_ Arachas BidCo Designated Activity Company (the “RoI Collateral Provider”) is incorporated under the laws of Ireland (“RoI”) and has its registered offices in Ireland. Under the Recast Insolvency Regulation, the RoI Collateral Provider’s centre of main interest (“RCOMI”) is presumed to be the place of its registered office (i.e. Ireland) in the absence of proof to the contrary and provided that the RoI Collateral Provider did not move its registered office within the three months prior to a request to open insolvency proceedings. As the RoI Collateral Provider’s COMI is presumed to be Ireland, any main insolvency proceedings in respect of the RoI Collateral Provider would fall within the jurisdiction of the courts of Ireland. As to what might constitute ‘‘proof to the contrary’’ regarding the location of a company’s COMI, the key decision is that in Re Eurofood IFSC Ltd ((2004) 4 IR 370 (Irish High Court); (2006) IESC 41 (Irish Supreme Court); (2006) Ch 508; ECJ Case C 341/04 (European Court of Justice)), given in respect of the equivalent provision in the previous EU Insolvency Regulation (Regulation (EC) No. 1346/2000). In that case, on a reference from the Irish Supreme Court, the European Court of Justice concluded that ‘‘factors which are both objective and ascertainable by third parties’’ would be needed to demonstrate that a company’s actual situation is different from that which the location of its registered office is deemed to reflect. For instance, if a company with its registered office in Ireland does not carry on any business in Ireland, that could rebut the presumption that the company’s COMI is in Ireland. However, if a company with its registered office in Ireland does carry on business in Ireland, the fact that its economic choices are controlled by a parent undertaking in another jurisdiction would not, of itself, be sufficient to rebut the presumption. If the RoI Collateral Provider’s COMI was found to be in another EU jurisdiction (other than Denmark) and not in Ireland, main insolvency proceedings would be opened in that jurisdiction instead. RoI insolvency laws and other limitations could limit the enforceability of any security interests granted by the RoI Collateral Provider. The following is a brief description of certain aspects of RoI insolvency laws and processes relating to certain limitations on the security interests in respect of the Notes, insofar as they are provided by the RoI Collateral Provider. The description below is only a summary, and does not purport to be complete or to discuss all of the limitations on the security interests in respect of the Notes, insofar as they are provided by the RoI Collateral Provider. 474 ----- The application of these laws could adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights under the the Collateral securing the Notes and limit any amounts that you may receive. We have also analyzed the typical forms of security interests in RoI, which are commonly created in RoI over a company’s assets, namely fixed and floating charges. _Fixed and floating charges_ Under RoI law, there are a number of ways in which fixed charge security has an advantage over floating charge security: (a) an examiner appointed to the charging company can deal with floating charge assets; (b) a fixed charge, even if created after the date of a floating charge, may have priority as against the floating charge over the charged assets; (c) general costs and expenses (including the liquidator’s remuneration) properly incurred in a winding-up are payable out of the company’s assets, and in certain circumstances, in priority to floating charge claims; (d) until the floating charge security crystallizes, a company is entitled to deal with assets that are subject to floating charge security in the ordinary course of business, meaning that such assets can be effectively disposed of by the charging company so as to give a third-party good title to the assets free of the floating charge and so as to give rise to the risk of security being granted over such assets in priority to the floating charge security; (e) floating charge security is subject to certain challenges under Irish insolvency law (See “Challenges to guarantees and _security—Grant of floating charge”); and (f) floating charge security is subject to the claims of_ preferential creditors in a winding-up (such as certain taxes, occupational pension scheme contributions, salaries owed to employees (subject to a cap per employee) and holiday pay owed to employees). Under RoI law there is a possibility that a court could recharacterize fixed security interests purported to be created by a security document as floating charges; the description given to security interests by the parties is not determinative. Whether security interests labelled as fixed will be upheld as fixed security interests rather than floating security interests will depend on, among other things, whether the chargee has the requisite degree of control over the relevant chargor’s ability to deal in the relevant assets and the proceeds thereof and, if so, whether such control is exercised by the chargee in practice. Where the chargor is free to deal with the secured assets without the consent of the chargee prior to crystallization, the court is likely to hold that the security interest in question constitutes a floating charge, notwithstanding that it may be described as a fixed charge in the security documents. In addition, to the extent that any of the assets which are expressed to be subject to a fixed charge are not specifically identified, the court may hold that such assets are, in fact, subject to a floating charge. _Preferred creditors under RoI Law_ Under Section 621 (Preferential Payments in a winding up) (“Section 621”) of the Companies Act 2014 (as amended, the “Companies Act”) in a winding-up of an RoI company certain preferential debts are required to be paid in priority to all debts other than those secured by a fixed charge. Preferential debts therefore have priority over debts secured by a floating charge. If the assets of the relevant company available for the payment of general creditors are insufficient to pay the preferential debts, they are required to be paid out of the property subject to the floating charge. Section 621 was amended by the Companies (Accounting) Act 2017 (with effect from 9 June 2017) with the effect that a charge created as a floating charge by a company will continue to rank as a floating charge on a winding up of that company, even if that floating charge has crystallised. Under Section 440 (Preferential Payments when receiver appointed under floating charge) of the Companies Act, the holder of a floating charge, or a receiver appointed by such a holder, who takes possession of property subject to the floating charge when the company is not in the course of being wound up, is required to pay the preferential debts out of that property in priority to principal and interest secured by the floating charge. Such preferential debts would comprise, among other things, any amounts owed in respect of local rates and certain amounts owed to the RoI Revenue Commissioners for income/corporation/capital gains tax, value added tax (VAT), employee related taxes, social security and pension scheme contributions and remuneration, salaries and wages of employees and certain contractors and the expenses of liquidation. 475 ----- In addition, there is a further limited category of super preferential creditors which take priority, not only over unsecured creditors and holders of floating security, but also over holders of fixed security. These super preferential claims include the remuneration, costs and expenses properly incurred by any examiner of the company which may include any borrowings made by an examiner to fund the company’s requirements for the duration of his appointment that have been approved by the RoI courts, (see “—Examinership” below) and any capital gains tax payable on the disposition of an asset of the company by a liquidator, receiver or mortgagee in possession as well as, in certain circumstances, PAYE and VAT arrears where a fixed charge over book debts is created. Furthermore, and as referred to above (See “Fixed and Floating Charges”), in the case of the application of moneys arising from the realization of secured assets that are subject to a floating charge, or in a winding-up, the costs of the liquidation and the liquidator’s fees will take priority over the claims of floating chargeholders in respect of relevant assets.",N/A,as_expected,2024,879
1923_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,1447,CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS,1447.5,Examinership,1447.5.1,,"Examinership is a court procedure available under the Companies Act to facilitate the survival of the whole or part of an RoI company the whole or any part of its undertaking through the appointment of an examiner and the formulation by the examiner of proposals for a compromise or scheme of arrangement. In circumstances where an RoI company is or is likely to be unable to pay its debts, then that company, the directors of that company, a contingent, prospective or actual creditor of that company, or shareholders of that company holding, at the date of presentation of the petition, not less than one-tenth of the paid-up voting share capital of that company are each entitled to petition the court for the appointment of an examiner to that company. Provided the company can demonstrate its survival (and all or part of its undertaking) as a going concern, and can satisfy certain tests, the RoI company may be placed under the protection of the relevant Irish court (the Court) for a period of time whilst its affairs are investigated by an independent examiner whose function is to see whether the company is capable of being rescued and to supervise the restructuring process. Where the relevant Irish court appoints an examiner to a company, it may, at the same or any time thereafter, make an order appointing the examiner to be examiner for the purposes of the Companies Act to a related company of such company. Once confirmed by the relevant Irish court the scheme is binding on the company and all its members and creditors. During the protection period the day-to-day business of the company remains under the control of the directors of the company, subject to certain rights of the examiner to apply to the relevant Irish court. Once appointed an examiner must, as soon as practical, formulate proposals for a compromise or scheme of arrangement in relation to the company to which he has been appointed. Typically, a scheme of arrangement will involve the writing down of creditors’ claims (both secured and unsecured, contingent and actual) that are in existence at the date of the petition and the introduction into the company of new funds. The examiner has the power to set aside contracts and arrangements entered into by the company after this appointment and, in certain circumstances, can avoid a negative pledge given by the company prior to this appointment. Furthermore, the examiner may sell assets of the company which are the subject of security. Where such assets are the subject of a fixed security interest, the examiner must account to the holders of the fixed security interest for the amount realized and discharge the amount due to the holders of the fixed security interest out of the proceeds of the sale. Having formulated his proposals, he must convene meetings of such classes of members and creditors as he thinks proper to consider acceptance of his proposals. The examiner must report to the Court on the outcome of his meetings within 35 days of his appointment, although the 35 day period can be extended by the Court. There is acceptance by creditors or by a class of creditors when a majority in number representing a majority in value of the claims represented at the meeting vote in favor of the proposals. The proposals must be confirmed by the Court if they are to become effective and the Court can confirm the proposals only if, inter alia: (a) a majority in number of creditors whose interests or claims would be impaired by implementation of the proposals, representing a majority in value of the 476 ----- claims that would be impaired by implementation of the proposals, have voted to accept the proposals; (b) if the abovementioned requirement (a) is not satisfied, then a majority of the classes of creditors whose interests would be impaired by the scheme of arrangement have voted to accept them, provided that, at least one of those creditor classes is a class of secured creditors or is senior to the class of ordinary unsecured creditors; or (c) if the abovementioned requirement (b) is not satisfied, at least one class of creditors whose interests or claims would be impaired by the proposals, other than a class which would not receive any payment or keep any interest in liquidation, has voted to accept them; and (d) no dissenting creditor would be worse off if the proposals are confirmed and implemented than such a creditor would be if the normal ranking of liquidation priorities were applied, either in the event of liquidation, whether piecemeal or by sale as a going concern, or in the event of the next-best-alternative scenario if the proposals were not confirmed. Once confirmed by the Court, the proposals become binding on the company and all creditors (whether secured or unsecured) or the class or classes of creditors (whether secured or unsecured), as the case may be, affected by the proposals and their rights are accordingly modified. For as long as a company is under the protection of the relevant Irish court, no attachment, sequestration, distress or execution shall be put into force against the property or effects of the relevant company except with the consent of the examiner. Section 520 (Effect of petition to appoint examiner on creditors _and others) of the Companies Act provides, among other things, that except with the consent of the_ examiner: - where any claim against the company is secured by a mortgage, charge, lien or other encumbrance or a pledge of, on or affecting the whole or any part of the property, effects or income of the ROI company, no action may be taken to realise the whole or any part of such security (save in certain circumstances where the secured asset is located in another EU member state, and the secured party has rights in rem with respect to those assets as a matter of the laws of that member state); - no receiver over any part of the property or undertaking of the RoI company shall be appointed (and if a receiver was appointed before the petition was presented, that receiver was unable to act); and - no proceedings for the winding up of the company may be commenced and no resolution for winding up of the company may be passed (and no such resolution passed shall have any effect). In addition, pursuant to Section 521 (Restriction on payment of pre-petition debts) of the Companies Act, no payment may be made by a company during the period of Court protection by way of satisfaction or discharge of the whole or a part of a liability incurred by the company before the date upon which the petition for the examiner’s appointment was presented unless the independent expert’s report under Section 511 (Independent expert’s report) of the Companies Act that accompanied the petition recommended that all or part of that liability be discharged or satisfied, or such payment is authorized by the Relevant Irish court (on application of the examiner or any interested party) where the Relevant Irish court is satisfied that a failure to discharge or satisfy in whole or in part that liability would considerably reduce the prospects of the company or the whole or any part of its undertaking surviving as a going concern. The Companies Act allows for the renumeration, costs and expenses of the examiner which have been sanctioned by an order of the court (other than the expenses that, by virtue of section 529 of the Companies Act, are treated as expenses properly incurred by the examiner) to be paid prior to any other claims including secured claims. Section 529 of the Companies Act provides that any liabilities incurred by a company in examinership which are certified by the examiner which have been incurred in circumstances where, in the opinion of the examiner, the survival of the company under court protection as a going concern during the period would otherwise be seriously prejudiced, shall be treated as expenses properly incurred for the purposes of Section 554 of the Companies Act but will rank behind the claims of creditors secured by a mortgage, charge, lien or other 477 ----- encumbrance of a fixed nature or a pledge. Nonetheless, if the court sanctions borrowings by an examiner as part of the expenses of the examiner pursuant to Section 554 of the Companies Act, such borrowings will rank ahead of the claims of both unsecured creditors and creditors secured by a floating charge of the company under court protection. Where an examinership petition is presented in relation to a company, that company is deemed to be under the protection of the Court during the period beginning on presentation of the petition and ending 70 days later (which period may be extended by a further 30 days where the Court is satisfied that the examiner would not be able to present his report within 70 days, or by such further unlimited period as the Court may allow where the Court needs more time to consider the proposals contained in the examiner’s final report). In the event of an appeal of the Court’s decision, the protection period is likely to be further extended in order to allow the determination of the appeal. Furthermore, the Court may order that an examiner shall have any of the powers of a liquidator appointed by the Court would have, which could include the power to apply to have transactions disclaimed if the related contract amounted to an unfair preference.",N/A,as_expected,2024,879

In most cases this will only arise if an examiner or a liquidator is appointed to the RoI company within a specified period (as set out in more detail below) of the granting of the security and, in addition, the company was ‘‘unable to pay its debts’’ when the security interest was granted or when the guarantee was given or ‘‘unable to pay its debts’’ within the meaning of the Companies Act as a result. The following potential grounds for challenge may apply to security interests and guarantees: _Unfair preference_ Under Irish insolvency law, if an ROI company goes into liquidation, a liquidator may apply to the court to have certain transactions disclaimed if the related contract amounted to an unfair preference. Section 604 (Unfair preference: effect of winding up on antecedent and other transactions) of the Companies Act (“Section 604”) provides that any conveyance, mortgage, delivery of goods, payment, 478 ----- execution or other act relating to property made or done by or against a company which is unable to pay its debts as they become due in favour of any creditor of the company or any person on trust for any such creditor, with a view to giving such creditor (or any surety or guarantor of the debt due to such creditor) a preference over the company’s other creditors, shall be deemed to be an unfair preference of its creditors and be invalid accordingly if a winding up of the company commences within six months of the doing of the act and the company is, at the date of commencement of the winding up, unable to pay its debts (taking into account contingent and prospective liabilities). Where the creditor that has received the preference is a “connected person”, the invalidation period is extended from six months to two years, and there will be a rebuttable presumption under law that there was an intention to unfairly prefer that creditor. _Improperly transferred assets_ Under Section 608 (Power of the court to order return of assets which have been improperly transferred) of the Companies Act (“Section 608”), if it can be shown on the application of a liquidator, creditor or contributory of a company which is being wound up, to the satisfaction of the High Court, that any property of that company was disposed of (including a disposal by way of charge, security assignment or mortgage) and the effect of such a disposal was to “perpetrate a fraud” on the company, its creditors or members, the High Court may, if it deems it just and equitable to do so, order any person who appears to have ‘‘use, control or possession’’ of the property concerned, or of the proceeds of the sale or development of that property, to deliver it or them, or to pay a sum in respect of it to the liquidator on such terms as the High Court sees fit. The ability to use Section 608 to challenge the transfer of assets has been extended to receivers and examiners. Section 608 does not apply to a disposal that would constitute an unfair preference for the purposes of Section 604. _Disclaimer of onerous contracts_ Under Section 615 (Disclaimer of onerous property in case of company being wound up) of the Companies Act, the liquidator of a company may, by the giving of notice, disclaim any onerous property of the company. “Onerous property” is defined to include any “unprofitable contract” and “any other property (of the company) which is unsaleable or not readily saleable by reason of its binding the possessor of it to the performance of any onerous act or to the payment of any sum of money.” _Grant of floating charge_ Under Section 597 (Circumstances in which floating charge is invalid) of the Companies Act, a floating charge is invalid if created in the period of twelve months (or two years if created in favour of a “connected person”) ending with the date of commencement of the winding up of the company, and unless it can be proven that the company was solvent immediately after the creation of the charge. Such invalidity does not apply to money actually advanced or paid or the actual price or value of goods or services sold or supplied to the company at the time or after the creation of, and in consideration for, the charge together with interest at the appropriate rate.",N/A,as_expected,2024,879

The validity and enforceability of a security interest may be contested on the basis that it is prohibited under the relevant company’s constitution. To the extent that the constitution does not allow such an action, there is the risk that the grant of the guarantees may be found to be void and unenforceable. Further, guarantees or covenants to pay in security documents by an Irish company for the obligations 479 ----- of another group company must be in the commercial interest and for the corporate benefit of the Irish company. If the granting of any security interest is not for the Irish company’s corporate benefit, the security interest could be held null and void. The question of corporate benefit is determined on a caseby-case basis and consideration has to be given to any direct and/or indirect benefit that the company would actually derive from the transaction and is particularly relevant for upstream or cross-stream guarantees or security. The question whether or not the corporate benefit requirement is met is a matter of fact, which must be assessed by the competent body of the company being the board of directors of the company acting bona fide in the interest of the company. If the corporate benefit requirement is not met, the directors of the company may be held liable by the company for negligence in the management of the company. Moreover, the security interests could be declared null and void. The validity and/or enforceability of the security interests may also be subject to the statutes of limitations, defences such as set-off or counterclaim, the doctrine of frustration and the doctrine of estoppel, and the fact that equitable remedies will only be granted by the Irish court in its discretion. Subject to certain exceptions, under Section 82 (Financial assistance for acquisition of shares) of the Companies Act (‘‘Section 82’’), it is unlawful for a RoI company to give, whether directly or indirectly, and whether by means of a loan, guarantee, the provision of security or otherwise, any financial assistance for the purpose of a purchase or subscription made or to be made by any person or for any shares in the company or its holding company. As a result, the Notes may only be secured by the relevant ROI company to the extent that it would not result in such security constituting the giving of unlawful financial assistance under Section 82. Pursuant to Section 1001 of the RoI Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, the holder of a fixed security over book debts of an RoI tax resident company may be required by notice from the RoI Revenue Commissioners to pay to them sums equivalent to those which the holder thereafter receives in payment of debts due to it by the relevant company. Where the holder of the security has informed the RoI Revenue Commissioners of the creation of the security within 21 days of its creation (or within 21 days of the transfer of the security to the holder) the holder’s liability is limited to the amount of certain outstanding RoI tax liabilities of the company (including liabilities in respect of value added tax) arising after the issue to the holder of a notice from the RoI Revenue Commissioners. The RoI Revenue Commissioners may also attach any debt due to an RoI tax resident company by another person in order to discharge any liabilities of the company in respect of outstanding tax whether the liabilities are due on its own account or as an agent or trustee. It is possible that the scope of this right of the RoI Revenue Commissioners may override the rights of holders of security (whether fixed or floating) over the debt in question.",N/A,as_expected,2024,879

With effect from the date of declaration, an unsecured creditor has no other remedy against the property or person of the debtor, and may not commence or, except with the consent of the Jersey Viscount or the Royal Court, continue any legal proceedings to recover the debt but may prove in the désastre. With effect from the date of declaration, a secured party may, however, without the consent of the Jersey Viscount and without an order of the court, exercise any power of enforcement it may have under Part 7 (Enforcement of Security Interests) of the Security Interests (Jersey) Law 2012 (the “2012 Law”). To the extent that the proceeds of such enforcement are insufficient to discharge liabilities owed, that secured party has no other remedy against the property or person of the debtor, and may not commence any legal proceedings or, except with the consent of the Jersey Viscount or the Royal Court, continue any legal proceedings to recover the balance of the debt. Additionally, the creditors or shareholders of a Jersey company can instigate a winding up of an insolvent company, which is known as a “creditors’ winding up” pursuant to Chapter 4 of Part 21 of the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991, as amended (the “Companies Law”). On a creditors’ winding up commenced by shareholders, a liquidator is nominated by the shareholders. The creditors may approve such a liquidator or apply to appoint a different liquidator. The liquidator will stand in the shoes of the directors and administer the winding up, gather assets, make appropriate disposals of assets, settle claims and distribute assets as appropriate. On a creditors' winding up commenced by application to court by a creditor, the court may appoint a provisional liquidator any time after the application. At the hearing of the application, if a winding up order is made, the court may appoint a person nominated by the creditor or selected by the court to be liquidator. If a liquidator is appointed by the court, any creditor of the company may within seven days of the creditors' meeting apply to court for someone else to be appointed liquidator instead of the liquidator appointed by the court. The liquidator stands in the shoes of the directors and administers the winding up, gathers assets, makes appropriate disposals of assets, settles claims and distributes assets as appropriate. After the appointment of a provisional liquidator or the commencement of the winding up (whether commenced by shareholders or court order), no action can be taken or proceeded with against the company except with the leave of the Royal Court. In a creditors' winding up commenced by shareholders, the company must give creditors 14 days’ notice of the shareholders meeting to commence the creditors’ winding up and give notice of a creditors meeting to be held immediately after the shareholders meeting. A creditor who applies to wind up the company must give the company at least 48 hours' notice that the application is being made. If the court orders a creditors' winding up or appoints a provisional liquidator, the liquidator must, within seven days of the liquidator's appointment, give creditors of the company notice calling a creditors meeting to be held in Jersey 21 days after the date of the court order. After the commencement of the creditors’ winding up, a secured party may, however, without the sanction of a liquidator and without an order of the court, exercise any power of enforcement it may have under Part 7 (Enforcement of Security Interests) of the 2012 Law. To the extent that the proceeds of such enforcement are insufficient to discharge liabilities owed, the secured party has no other remedy against the company without leave of the Royal Court. The corporate state and capacity of the company continues until the end of the winding up procedure, when the company is dissolved. The Companies Law requires a creditor of a company (subject to appeal) to be bound by an arrangement entered into by the company and its creditors immediately before or in the course of its winding up if (inter alia) three quarters in number and value of the creditors acceded to the arrangement. 481 -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,879

There is a 12 month look back period from the date of commencement of the winding up or declaration of “désastre” during which transactions are susceptible to examination pursuant to this rule (the “relevant time”). The Jersey Bankruptcy Law and Companies Law contain detailed provisions, including (without limitation) those that define what constitutes a preference, the operation of the relevant time and the effect of entering into a preference with a person connected with the company or with an associate of the company. A transaction will constitute a preference if it has the effect of putting a creditor of the Jersey company (or a surety or guarantor for any of the company’s debts or liabilities) in a better position (in the event of the company going into an insolvent winding up) than such creditor, guarantor or surety would otherwise have been in had that transaction not been entered into. If the Royal Court determines that the transaction constituted such a preference, it has very wide powers for restoring the position to what it would have been if that preference had not been given (although there is protection for a third party who enters into one of the transactions in good faith and without notice). However, for the Royal Court to do so, it must be shown that in deciding to give the preference the Jersey company was influenced by a desire to produce the preferential effect. In any proceedings, it is for the Jersey Viscount or liquidator to demonstrate that the Jersey company was insolvent at the relevant time and that the company was influenced by a desire to produce the preferential effect, unless the beneficiary of the transaction was a connected person, in which case there is a presumption that the company was influenced by a desire to produce the preferential effect and the connected person must demonstrate in such proceedings that the company was not influenced by such a desire.",N/A,as_expected,2024,879

A disclaimer operates to determine, as of the date it is made, the “rights, interests and liabilities of the company/debtor in or in respect of the property disclaimed and discharges the company/Jersey Viscount from all liability in respect of the property as of the date of the commencement of the creditors’ winding up/from the date of the declaration in or in respect of the property disclaimed” but “does not, except so far as is necessary for the purpose of releasing the company/debtor from liability, affect the rights or liabilities of any other person.” A person sustaining loss or damage as a result of a disclaimer is deemed to be a creditor of the company to the extent of the loss or damage and shall have standing as a creditor in the désastre or creditors’ winding up.

The Insolvency Act 1986 (either as originally enacted or as amended, including by the provisions of the Enterprise Act 2002) does not apply in Jersey and receivers, administrative receivers and administrators are not part of the laws of Jersey. Accordingly, the Royal Court may not recognize the powers of an administrator, administrative receiver or other receiver appointed in respect of Jersey situs assets. The Royal Court (in its inherent jurisdiction) may, however, under Article 49(1) of the Jersey Bankruptcy Law assist the courts of prescribed countries and territories and, applying general principles of comity, assist the courts in other jurisdictions, in all matters relating to the insolvency of any person to the extent that the Royal Court think fit. Further, in doing so, the Royal Court may have regard to the UNCITRAL model law, even though the model law has not been (and is unlikely to be) implemented as a separate law in Jersey. If insolvency proceedings have been commenced in another jurisdiction in relation to the company, the nature and extent of the cooperation from Jersey is likely to depend on the nature of the requesting country’s insolvency regime. 483 ----- In the case of both statutory and non-statutory requests for assistance, it should be noted that the UNCITRAL provisions will not automatically be followed as this is a matter for the discretion of the Royal Court. The court’s position may also not be in accordance with the EU Insolvency Regulation. Jersey does not form part of the European Community for the purposes of implementation of its directions. Accordingly, the EU Insolvency Regulation does not apply as a matter of Jersey domestic law and the automatic test of centre of main interests does not apply. Enforcement of a security interest against a Jersey company may be further limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation, dissolution, re-organization or other laws of general application relating to or affecting the rights of creditors, and laws in relation to transactions at an undervalue, preferences, extortionate credit transactions, disclaimer of onerous property and fraudulent dispositions also apply in Jersey. Under Jersey law, security over Jersey situs assets is created in accordance with the provisions of Jersey law. The Jersey situs assets of the Jersey Obligors will be secured pursuant to Jersey law governed security interest agreements. The 2012 Law provides that a secured party may enforce security over intangible movable assets by way of sale or appropriation of the collateral or proceeds. In addition, a secured party may take certain ancillary actions, including any bespoke enforcement powers included in a security agreement, to the extent not in conflict with the 2012 Law. More than one enforcement option can be taken, and taking one or more of the enforcement options specified above does not preclude the exercise of other rights of a secured party. The power of enforcement is exercisable once an event of default has occurred and written notice specifying the event of default has been served on the grantor by the secured party. If enforcement is by way of sale or appropriation, the secured party must give the grantor 14 days’ prior written notice. Importantly, the grantor may agree in writing to waive its right to notice of appropriation or sale and it is usual to include such a waiver in the security agreement. The secured party is obliged on sale or appropriation, to give at least 14 days’ prior written notice to: (i) any person who, 21 days before the sale or appropriation, has a registered security interest in the collateral; and (ii) any person other than the grantor who has an interest in the collateral and has, not less than 21 days before the sale or appropriation, given the secured party notice of that interest unless, in each case, the secured party and such person have otherwise agreed in writing. There are specific carve-outs from the obligation to give notice of sale. On exercising the power of enforcement by appropriation or sale, the secured party must: (i) take all commercially reasonable steps to determine or, in the case of a sale, obtain the fair market value of the collateral, as at the time of the relevant appropriation or sale; (ii) act in a commercially reasonable manner in relation to the appropriation or sale; and (iii) (in the case of a sale only) enter into any agreement for or in relation to the sale only on commercially reasonable terms. The duty of the secured party is owed to the grantor and also to any other person to whom the secured party was required to give notice of sale or appropriation (whether or not they have agreed in writing to waive the notice requirements). If, in exercising its powers of enforcement, a secured party appropriates or sells collateral, it must, within 14 days after the day on which the collateral is appropriated or sold, give certain persons (being the grantor (subject to it having waived this requirement), any person with a registered subordinate security interest and certain persons claiming an interest in the collateral) a written statement of account setting out certain information in relation to that appropriation or sale. If a secured party has sold or appropriated the collateral and the net value or proceeds of appropriation or sale (as appropriate) of the collateral exceeds the amount of the debt owed to the secured party, the secured party shall pay the amount of any resulting surplus in the following order: (i) in payment, in due order of priority, to any person who has a subordinate security interest in the collateral and has registered a financing statement over that security interest (where the registration remained effective immediately before the appropriation or sale); (ii) in payment to any other person (other than the grantor) who has given the secured party notice that that person claims an interest in the collateral and in respect of which the secured party is satisfied that that person has a legally enforceable interest in the collateral; and (iii) as to the balance (if any) in payment to the relevant debtor grantor. Alternatively, the secured party may discharge its obligation above with respect to any surplus by paying that amount into the Royal Court. The surplus may then only be paid out on the order of the court on application by a person entitled to the surplus. 484 -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,879

The objectives of the EU Restructuring Directive are to ensure that (i) viable enterprises and entrepreneurs that are in financial difficulties have access to effective national preventive restructuring frameworks that enable them to continue operating, (ii) honest insolvent or over-indebted entrepreneurs (i.e. individuals) can benefit from a full discharge of debt after a reasonable period of time, thereby affording them a second chance and (iii) the effectiveness of procedures concerning restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt is improved, in particular with a view to shortening their length. The Restructuring Directive aims to achieve a higher degree of harmonization in the field of restructuring, insolvency, discharge of debt and disqualifications by establishing substantive minimum standards for preventive restructuring procedures as well as for procedures leading to a discharge of debt for entrepreneurs in order to promote a culture that encourages early preventive restructuring to address financial difficulties at an early stage, when it appears likely that insolvency can be prevented 487 ----- and the viability of the business can be ensured. Most notably, the Restructuring Directive provides for a framework pursuant to which (a) a stay of individual enforcement actions by creditors against debtors must be introduced by Member States national legislation, (b) all creditor claims shall be grouped into separate classes each of which shall reflect a commonality of interests (at a minimum, creditors of secured and unsecured claims shall be treated in separate classes), (c) creditor claims may be restructured in a restructuring plan by majority vote with a majority of not more than 75% of the amount of the claims in each class and, where the Member State so requires, a majority in number of affected parties in each class and (d) a cross-class cram-down is introduced whereby a restructuring plan may, under certain conditions, be adopted and bind dissenting creditors even if the creditors of one or more classes do not consent to the restructuring plan with the required majority. In order to be adopted the plan will have to be confirmed by a judicial or administrative authority that will in particular ensure the protection of each type of creditors’ rights and compliance with the priority rules governing the adoption of the plan. The transposition of the Restructuring Directive into national legislation shall protect new financing and interim financing and may also provide priority ranking to new or interim financing granted in the context of the restructuring. The EU Restructuring Directive shall be transposed into national laws or regulations by Member States by July 17, 2021 (with the exception of the provisions relating to the use of electronic means of communication for which the time period for the transposition expires in certain respects on July 17, 2024 or, in others, on July 17, 2026), subject to a maximum 1 year extension of the transposition period for Member States encountering particular difficulties in implementing the EU Restructuring Directive.",N/A,as_expected,2024,879

Pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of May 20, 2015 on insolvency proceedings (recast), replacing Council Regulation (EC) No. 1346/2000 of May 29, 2000 on insolvency proceedings, as amended (as amended from time to time, the “EU Insolvency Regulation”), the court which shall have jurisdiction to commence the main insolvency proceedings in relation to a company (subject to certain exceptions) incorporated under the laws of a Member State is the court of the Member State (other than Denmark) in which the relevant company’s “center of main interests” (as that term is used in Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, “COMI”) is situated. The determination of where any such company has its COMI is a question of fact on which the courts of the different Member States may have different and even conflicting views. COMI is not a static concept. There is however a rebuttable presumption under Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation that any such company has its COMI in the Member State in which it has its registered office. Recital 28 of the EU Insolvency Regulation states that the COMI of a debtor should correspond to the place where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and which “is ascertainable by third parties.” In that respect, factors such as where board meetings are held, the location where the company conducts the majority of its business and the location where the large majority of the Company’s creditors are established may all be relevant in the determination of the place where the company has its COMI. A company’s COMI may change from time to time but is determined for the purposes of deciding which courts have competent jurisdiction to commence insolvency proceedings pursuant to the EU Insolvency Regulation at the time of the filing of the insolvency petition. The presumption described above shall however only apply if the registered office has not been moved to another Member State within the three-month period prior to the request for the opening of insolvency proceedings (as defined in Article (3) of the EU Insolvency Regulation). Based on a recent decision by the European Court of Justice, the court of a Member State with which a request to open main insolvency proceedings has been lodged retains exclusive jurisdiction to open such proceedings where the center of the debtor’s main interests is moved to another Member State after that request has been lodged, but before that court has delivered a decision on it. If the COMI of a company is and will remain located in a Member State, the main insolvency proceedings in respect of the company under the EU Insolvency Regulation would be commenced in such jurisdiction and accordingly a court in such jurisdiction would be entitled to commence the types of insolvency proceedings referred to in Annex A to the EU Insolvency Regulation. Main insolvency proceedings opened in one Member State under the EU Insolvency Regulation are automatically recognized in the other Member States (other than Denmark), although secondary proceedings may be initiated in another Member State in the event that the company has an “establishment” (within the meaning and as defined in Article 2(10) of the EU Insolvency Regulation) in the territory of such other Member State. An “establishment” is defined to mean “any place of operations where a debtor carries on non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets.” 485 ----- Secondary proceedings are limited to winding-up proceedings and the effects of such secondary proceedings are restricted to the assets of the company situated in the territory of such other Member State. Where main proceedings in the Member State in which the debtor has its COMI have not yet been commenced, pursuant to Article 3 (4) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, territorial insolvency proceedings may only be commenced in another Member State where the debtor has an establishment where either (i) insolvency proceedings cannot be commenced in the Member State in which the debtor’s COMI is situated under that Member State’s law or (ii) the opening of territorial insolvency proceedings is requested by (a) a creditor whose claim arises from or is in connection with the operation of an establishment situated within the territory of the Member State where the opening of territorial proceedings is requested, or (b) a public authority that has the right to request the opening of insolvency proceedings under the law of the Member State in which the establishment is located. The effects of “territorial proceedings” shall be restricted to the assets of the debtor situated in the territory of the Member State where such proceedings are opened. When main insolvency proceedings are opened, territorial insolvency proceedings become secondary insolvency proceedings. Irrespective of whether the insolvency proceedings are main or secondary or territorial insolvency proceedings, such proceedings will, subject to certain exceptions, be governed by the lex fori concursus, i.e., the local insolvency law of the court that has assumed jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings of the debtor. Furthermore, pursuant to Article 6 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of the Member State within the territory of which insolvency proceedings have been opened in accordance with its Article 3 shall have jurisdiction for any action that derives directly from the insolvency proceedings and is closely linked with them, such as avoidance actions. The opening of insolvency proceedings in a Member State pursuant to Article 8 of the EU Insolvency Regulation shall not affect the rights in rem of creditors or third parties in respect of tangible or intangible, moveable or immoveable assets, both specific assets and collections of indefinite assets as a whole that change from time to time, belonging to the debtor that are situated within the territory of another Member State at the time of the opening of proceedings. Rights in rem include: - the right to dispose of assets or have them disposed of and to obtain satisfaction from the proceeds of or income from those assets, in particular by virtue of a lien or a mortgage; - the exclusive right to have a claim met, in particular a right guaranteed by a lien in respect of the claim or by assignment of the claim by way of a guarantee; - the right to demand assets from, and/or to require restitution by, anyone having possession or use of them contrary to the wishes of the party so entitled; - a right in rem to the beneficial use of assets. The courts of all Member States (other than Denmark) must recognize the judgment of the court commencing main proceedings that will be given the same effect in the other Member States so long as no secondary proceedings have been commenced there. Pursuant to Article 21 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the insolvency practitioner appointed by the court of the main proceedings may exercise the powers conferred on him by the law of the Member State in which the main proceedings are located in another Member State as long as no insolvency proceedings have been opened in such other Member State or any preservation measure to the contrary has been taken there further to a request to open insolvency proceedings in such other Member State. He may, in particular, subject to the preservation of third parties’ right in rem pursuant to Article 8 of the EU Insolvency Regulation and to the preservation of the sellers’ rights based on a reservation of title pursuant to Article 10 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, remove assets of the company from that other Member State. 486 ----- Under Article 36 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings may attempt to avoid the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings in another Member State by giving a unilateral undertaking in respect of the assets located in the Member State in which secondary insolvency proceedings could be opened that the distribution of those assets or of the proceeds received as a result of their realization, will comply with the distribution and priority rights that would apply under the relevant national law if secondary insolvency proceedings were opened in such other Member State. Such undertaking must be made in writing and is subject to approval by a qualified majority of known local creditors, determined in accordance with the local law of such other Member State. If approved, the undertaking is binding on the insolvency estate and if a court is requested to open secondary insolvency proceedings, it shall, at the request of the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, refuse to open such proceedings if it is satisfied that the undertaking adequately protects the general interests of local creditors. Additionally, under Article 38 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, where a temporary stay of individual enforcement proceedings has been granted in order to allow for negotiations between a company and its creditors, the court, at the request of the company or of the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, may stay the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings for a period not exceeding three months, provided that suitable measures are in place to protect the interests of local creditors. Under Article 46 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the court that opened the secondary insolvency proceedings will also stay the process of realization of assets in whole or in part upon receipt of a request from the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, for a period of up to three months, unless such a request is manifestly of no interest to the creditors in the main insolvency proceedings. Such stay may be continued or renewed for similar periods. Where the court stays the process of realization of the assets, the court may require the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings to take any suitable measure to guarantee the interests of the creditors in the secondary insolvency proceedings and of individual classes of creditors. In addition, the EU Insolvency Regulation has created a treatment for groups of companies experiencing difficulties by the comment of group coordination proceedings and the appointment of an insolvency practitioner in order to facilitate the effective administration of the insolvency proceedings of the group’s members.",N/A,as_expected,2024,879
1923_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,1447,CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS,1447.19,The Netherlands,1447.19.1,Dutch Insolvency Law,"The Dutch Guarantor is incorporated in The Netherlands. It is therefore presumed its center of main interest for the purpose of the EU Insolvency Regulation is located in The Netherlands. Accordingly, any insolvency proceeding concerning the Dutch Guarantor would likely be based on Dutch insolvency law under the EU Insolvency Regulation. Under certain circumstances, bankruptcy proceedings may also be opened in The Netherlands in accordance with Dutch law over the assets of companies that are not incorporated or organized under Dutch law. Dutch insolvency laws differ significantly from insolvency proceedings in the U.S. and other jurisdictions and may make it more difficult to recover amounts one would normally expect to recover in a liquidation or bankruptcy proceeding in the U.S. or another jurisdiction. There are circumstances under Dutch insolvency law in which the granting by a Dutch company of security and guarantees can be challenged. The following is a brief description of certain aspects of Dutch insolvency law. There are three primary insolvency regimes under Dutch law: the first, moratorium of payments (surseance van betaling), is intended to facilitate the reorganization of a debtor’s indebtedness and enable the debtor to continue as a going concern. The second, the Dutch scheme, allows a debtor to offer a composition outside of formal insolvency proceedings such as suspension of payments or bankruptcy. The third, bankruptcy 488 ----- (faillissement), is primarily designed to liquidate assets and distribute the proceeds of the assets of a debtor to its creditors. All insolvency regimes are set forth in the Dutch Bankruptcy Act (Faillissementswet). In practice, a suspension of payments often results in bankruptcy. A general description of the principles of the three insolvency regimes is set out below. _Suspension of Payments_ An application for a moratorium of payments can only be made by the debtor itself, if it foresees that it will be unable to continue to pay its payable debts. Once the request for a moratorium of payments is filed, a court will immediately (dadelijk) grant a provisional moratorium and appoint one or more administrators (bewindvoerders). A meeting of creditors is required to decide on the definitive moratorium. If a draft composition (ontwerpakkoord) is filed simultaneously with the application for a moratorium of payments, the court can order that the composition will be processed before a decision about a definitive moratorium. If the composition is accepted and subsequently ratified by the court (gehomologeerd), the provisional moratorium ends. The definitive moratorium will generally be granted unless a qualified minority (more than one quarter of the amount of claims held by creditors represented at the creditors’ meeting or more than one third of the number of creditors represented at such creditors’ meeting) of the unsecured non preferential creditors withholds its consent. The granting of a definitive moratorium can also be withheld if there is a valid fear that the debtor will try to prejudice the creditors during a moratorium of payments or if there is no prospect that the debtor will be able to satisfy its creditors in the (near) future. A suspension of payments takes effect retroactively from 0.00 hours on the day on which the court has granted the provisional suspension of payments. The moratorium of payments is only effective with regard to unsecured non preferential creditors. Unlike Chapter 11 proceedings under U.S. bankruptcy law, during which both secured and unsecured creditors are generally barred from seeking to recover on their claims during a moratorium of payments, under Dutch law secured and preferential creditors (including tax and social security authorities) may enforce their rights against assets of the company in moratorium of payments to satisfy their claims as if there were no moratorium of payments. A recovery under Dutch law could, therefore, involve a sale of assets that does not reflect the going concern value of the debtor. However, at the request of an interested party the court can order a “cooling down period” (afkoelingsperiode) for a maximum period of two months (which can be extended by the court once for another period of two months) during which enforcement actions by secured or preferential creditors are barred. Also in a definitive moratorium of payments and a bankruptcy, a composition (akkoord) may be offered to creditors. A composition will be binding for all unsecured and non-preferential creditors if it is approved by (i) a simple majority of the number of creditors represented at the creditors’ meeting, representing at least 50% in amount of the claims that are acknowledged and admitted in the moratorium, and (ii) subsequently ratified (gehomologeerd) by the court. Consequently, Dutch insolvency law could preclude or inhibit the ability of the noteholders to effect a restructuring and could reduce the recovery of a holder of Notes in a Dutch moratorium of payments proceeding. Interest payments that fall due after the date on which a moratorium of payments is granted, cannot be claimed in a composition. Under Dutch law, as soon as a definitive suspension of payments is granted or the composition is ratified by a court, in principle, all pending executions of judgments against the relevant debtor, as well as all attachments on the debtor’s assets (other than with respect of secured creditors and certain other creditors, as described above), will be suspended or cancelled by operation of law.",N/A,as_expected,2024,879
1923_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,1447,CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS,1447.19,The Netherlands,1447.19.2,Dutch Scheme,"As regards the pre-insolvency plan regime, as of January 1, 2021, debtors have the possibility to offer a composition outside of formal insolvency proceedings (Onderhands akkoord) under the Dutch Bankruptcy Act. Unlike a moratorium and in bankruptcy, a composition can be offered to secured 489 ----- creditors as well as shareholders or any number of them. A composition may provide, inter alia, for cross class cramdown, the restructuring of group company obligations through either one or more aligned proceedings, the termination of onerous contracts with deactivation of _ipso facto_ default provisions, and supporting court measures. Such composition may result in claims against the Issuer and the Dutch guarantors as compromised if the relevant majority of creditors within a class or a more senior class vote in favor of such a composition. A composition plan can extend to claims against entities that are not incorporated or organized under Dutch law and/or are residing outside The Netherlands. Accordingly, a composition under the Dutch Bankruptcy Act can affect the rights of noteholders. Jurisdiction of the Dutch courts under the Dutch Bankruptcy Act may extend to entities incorporated or residing outside The Netherlands on the basis that there is a connection with the jurisdiction of The Netherlands. Under the Dutch Bankruptcy Act voting on a composition plan is done in classes. Approval by a class requires a decision adopted with a majority of two third of the claims of that class that have voted on the plan or, in the case of a class of shareholders, two thirds of the shares of that class that have voted on the plan. A composition may provide for the possibility for a composition plan to be binding on a non-consenting class (cross class cramdown). The court will confirm a composition plan if at least one class of creditors (other than a class of shareholders) that can be expected to receive a distribution in case of a bankruptcy of the debtor approves the plan, unless there is a statutory ground for refusal. The court can, inter alia, refuse confirmation of a composition plan on the basis of (i) a request by an affected creditor of a consenting class if the value of the distribution that such creditor receives under the plan is lower than the distribution it can be expected to receive in case of a bankruptcy of the debtor or (ii) a request of an affected creditor of a non-consenting class, if the plan provides for a distribution of value that deviates from the statutory or contractual ranking and priority to the detriment of that class. There is one mandatory refusal ground specifically applicable to secured financial creditors. If the composition plan entails a debt-for-equity swap to which such creditors do not want to ascribe, and these creditors do not have the right to opt for a different kind of distribution, the court will refuse confirmation of such plan on the request of such creditor. Under the Dutch Bankruptcy Act, the court may grant a stay on enforcement of a maximum of four months, with a possible extension of four months. During such period, inter alia, all enforcement action against the assets of (or in the possession of) the debtor is suspended, including action to enforce security over the assets of the debtor. Accordingly, during such stay a pledgee of claims may not collect nor notify the debtors of such pledged claims of its rights of pledge.",N/A,as_expected,2024,879
1923_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,1447,CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS,1447.19,The Netherlands,1447.19.3,Bankruptcy,"Under Dutch law, a debtor can be declared bankrupt when it has ceased to pay its debts. The bankruptcy can be requested by a creditor of a claim when there is at least one other creditor. At least one of the aforementioned claims (of the bankruptcy requesting creditor or the other creditor) needs to be due and payable. The debtor can also request the application of bankruptcy proceedings itself. Furthermore, the Public Prosecution Service (het Openbaar Ministerie) can request the application of bankruptcy proceedings for reasons of public interest (openbaar belang). There is no legal duty for a debtor to file for its own bankruptcy. However, if the managing board of a company realizes that the company is or will be unable to pay its debts when they come due, it is required to take appropriate measures, which could include the cessation of trading, notification of creditors and the filing for either bankruptcy or a suspension of payments (see above). As a result of a bankruptcy, the debtor loses all rights to administer and dispose of its assets. A bankruptcy order takes effect retroactively from 0.00 hours on the day the order is rendered. During a Dutch bankruptcy proceeding, the assets of a debtor are generally liquidated and the proceeds distributed to the debtor’s creditors in accordance with the respective rank and priority of their claims. The general principle of Dutch insolvency law is the paritas creditorum (principle of equal treatment), 490 ----- which means that all creditors have an equal right to payment and that the proceeds of bankruptcy proceedings shall be distributed in proportion to the size of their respective claims. However, certain creditors (such as secured creditors and tax and social security authorities) will have special rights that take priority over the rights of other creditors. Consequently, Dutch insolvency laws could reduce your potential recovery in a Dutch bankruptcy proceeding. The claim of a creditor may be limited depending on the date the claim becomes due and payable in accordance with its terms. Generally, claims of the noteholders that were not due and payable by their terms on the date of a bankruptcy of the Issuer or the relevant guarantor incorporated or organized under Dutch law will be accelerated and become due and payable as of that date. Each of these claims will have to be submitted to the bankruptcy receiver (curator) to be verified. “Verification” under Dutch law means that the receiver determines the value of the claim and whether and to what extent it will be admitted in the bankruptcy of the company for the purpose of the distribution of the proceeds. The valuation of claims that otherwise would not have been payable at the time of the bankruptcy proceeding may be based on a net present value analysis. Interest payments that fall due after the date of the bankruptcy cannot be verified, unless secured by a pledge or mortgage, in which case interest will be admitted pro memoria. The existence, value and ranking of any claims submitted by the noteholders may be challenged in the Dutch bankruptcy proceeding. Generally, in a creditors’ meeting (verificatievergadering), the bankruptcy receiver, the insolvent debtor and all verified creditors may dispute the verification of claims of other creditors. Creditors whose claims or value thereof are disputed in the creditors’ meeting may be referred to separate court proceedings (renvooiprocedure). These procedures could cause noteholders to recover less than the principal amount of their Notes or less than they could recover in a U.S. liquidation proceeding. Such _renvooi proceedings could also cause payments to the noteholders to be delayed compared with holders of undisputed claims. As in moratorium of payments proceedings, in the bankruptcy of a company a composition (akkoord) may be offered to creditors, which shall be binding on unsecured non preferential creditors if it is approved by (i) a simple majority in number of the creditors represented at the creditors’ meeting, representing at least 50% in amount of the claims that are acknowledged and conditionally admitted, and (ii) subsequently ratified (gehomologeerd) by the court. Remaining proceeds, if any, after satisfaction of the secured and the preferential creditors are distributed among the unsecured non preferential creditors, who will be satisfied on a pro rata basis. Contractual subordination may to a certain extent be given effect in Dutch insolvency proceedings. The actual effect depends largely on the way such subordination is construed. In exceptional circumstances, a compulsory plan of composition may limit the contractual subordination. Secured creditors may enforce their rights against assets of the debtor to satisfy their claims under a Dutch bankruptcy as if there is no bankruptcy. As in moratorium of payments proceedings the supervisory judge (rechtercommissaris) can order a “cooling down period” for a maximum of two months (which can be extended once for another period of two months) during which enforcement actions by secured creditors are barred unless such creditors have obtained leave for enforcement from the supervisory judge. Furthermore, a bankruptcy receiver can force a secured creditor to enforce its security interest within a reasonable period of time, failing which the receiver will be entitled to sell the secured assets, if any, and the secured creditor will have to share in the general costs of the bankruptcy, which can be significant. Excess proceeds of enforcement must be returned to the bankruptcy estate; they may not be set off against an unsecured claim of the secured creditor in the bankruptcy. An exception applies in the case of set off relating to a payment to the pledgor, not made during its bankruptcy and if there are no other pledgees or other holders of limited rights other than the pledgee, although a set off prior to bankruptcy may be subject to clawback in the case of fraudulent conveyance or bad faith in obtaining the claim used for set off. Moreover, to the extent that Dutch law applies, a legal act performed by a debtor (including, without limitation, an agreement pursuant to which it guarantees the performance of the obligations of a third party or agrees to provide or provides security for any of its or a third party’s obligations, enters into additional agreements benefiting from existing security and any other legal act having a similar effect) can be challenged in an insolvency proceeding 491 ----- or otherwise and may be nullified by any of its creditors or its trustee in bankruptcy. See below “— _Fraudulent Transfer.”_ Under Dutch law, as soon as a debtor is declared bankrupt, in principle, all pending executions of judgments against such debtor, as well as all attachments on the debtor’s assets (other than with respect to secured creditors and certain other creditors, as described above), will be terminated by operation of law. Simultaneously with the opening of the bankruptcy, a bankruptcy receiver will be appointed. The proceeds resulting from the liquidation of the bankruptcy estate may not be sufficient to satisfy unsecured creditors under the guarantees granted by an insolvent guarantor after the secured and the preferential creditors have been satisfied. In principle, litigation pending on the date of the bankruptcy order is automatically stayed.",N/A,as_expected,2024,879
1923_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,1447,CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS,1447.19,The Netherlands,1447.19.4,Limitations on Enforcement,"If a Dutch private limited liability company or public limited liability company grants a guarantee or security interest and that guarantee or security interest is not in the company’s corporate interest, the guarantee or security interest may be nullified by the relevant Dutch company, its bankruptcy receiver (curator) in bankruptcy (faillissement) and its administrator (bewindvoerder) in moratorium of payment proceedings (surseance _van_ _betaling) or otherwise and, as a consequence, not be valid, binding and enforceable against it. In determining whether the granting of a guarantee or security interest is in the interest of a Dutch company, Dutch courts would not only consider the text of the objects clause in the articles of association (statuten) of the company but all relevant circumstances, including (i) whether the company irrespective of the wording of the objects clause derives certain commercial benefits from the transaction in respect of which the guarantee or security interest was granted and (ii) the balance between the risk that the company is assuming and the benefit it derives from such transaction. In addition, if it is determined that there are no, or insufficient, commercial benefits from the transactions for the company that grants the guarantee, then such company (and any bankruptcy receiver) may challenge the enforcement of the guarantee or security interest, and it is possible that such challenge would be successful. Such benefit may, according to Dutch case law, consist of an indirect benefit derived by the company as a consequence of the interdependence of such company with the group of companies to which it belongs. In addition, it is relevant whether, as a consequence of the granting of the guarantee or security interest, the continuity of such company would foreseeably be endangered by the granting of such guarantee or security interest. It remains possible that even if such strong financial and commercial interdependence exists, the transaction may be declared void if it appears that the granting of the guarantee or security interest cannot serve the realization of the relevant company’s objects or where it is determined that there is a material imbalance to the disadvantage of the company between the commercial benefit on the one hand and the risks on the other hand. The above also applies with respect to any security interest granted or other legal act entered into by a Dutch company. If Dutch law applies, a guarantee or security governed by Dutch law may be voided by a court, if the document was executed through undue influence (misbruik van omstandigheden), fraud (bedrog), duress (bedreiging) or mistake (dwaling) of a party to the agreement contained in that document. Payment pursuant to a guarantee or following enforcement or foreclosure of security granted may, regardless of an insolvency situation occurring or not, also be withheld due to unforeseen circumstances (onvoorziene omstandigheden), force majeure (niet toerekenbare tekortkoming) or reasonableness and fairness (redelijkheid en billijkheid). Other impeding factors include dissolution (ontbinding) of contract and set off (verrekening). In addition, a guarantee issued by a Dutch company and a security interest provided by a Dutch company may be suspended (schorsen) by the Enterprise Chamber of the Court of Appeal in Amsterdam (Ondernemingskamer van het Gerechtshof te Amsterdam) on the motion of the holder or holders of 10% or more of the shares in such company, as well as on the motion of a trade union and of other entities entitled thereto in the articles of association of the relevant Dutch company. Likewise, the guarantee or 492 ----- security itself may be upheld by the Enterprise Chamber, yet actual payment under it may be suspended or avoided. According to Dutch case law, a director (bestuurder) of a company acts wrongfully against a creditor of the company if he has entered into commitments on behalf of that company, while he knew or reasonably ought to understand that the company would not, or not within a reasonable period of time, be able to meet its obligations and would not provide sufficient opportunity for recourse for the detriment that the creditor would suffer on the basis thereof. The foregoing is subject to any circumstances raised by the director on the basis of which the conclusion is justified that he personally cannot be blamed sufficiently (voldoende ernstig verwijt) for the detriment suffered.",N/A,as_expected,2024,879

Australian insolvency laws will be relevant upon the insolvency of this entity and the,1447.21.1,Voluntary administration,"Voluntary administration is a non-terminal insolvency process begun by the appointment of one or more administrators to a company, during which the administrator investigates the company’s affairs and recommends to its creditors whether it should enter into a Deed of Company Arrangement approved by its creditors, be wound up or revert to normal operation by its directors. The most common method for appointment of an administrator is for the company’s board to resolve that in the opinion of the directors voting for the resolution, the company is insolvent, or is likely to become insolvent at some future time and that an administrator should be appointed. A creditor with a security interest over the whole, or substantially the whole, of the company’s property can also appoint an administrator, as can a liquidator or provisional liquidator (if the company is already in liquidation or provisional liquidation). A company need not be presently insolvent to enter into voluntary administration, however in the case of an appointment by the company’s board or a liquidator or provisional liquidator, the appointer must believe that the company is likely to become insolvent at some future time. A creditor with a security interest over the whole, or substantially the whole, of the company’s property, may only appoint an administrator if that security interest has become, and remains, enforceable. Voluntary administration is a procedure designed to salvage insolvent or near-insolvent companies so that the company can return to trading or provide a better return for creditors and shareholders. It is the only formal process in Australia with rehabilitation as one of its express goals. The objects of Part 5.3A of the Corporations Act (which deals with voluntary administration) are set out in section 435A as follows: 493 ----- The object of this part is to provide for the business, property and affairs of an insolvent company to be administered in a way that: - maximizes the chances of the company or as much as possible of its business, continuing in existence; or - if it is not possible for the company or its business to continue in existence—results in a better return for the company’s creditors and members than would result from an immediate winding up of the company. The duration of voluntary administration is prescribed in the Corporations Act and is intended to provide for a short period of administration, although the administrator can seek a short adjournment from creditors of the company or a direction from an Australian court to lengthen the period of the administration where the circumstances justify that course. During the period of voluntary administration, the administrator controls the company (the powers of the directors and officers are suspended). The administrator is free to carry on the business of the company and does so as the company’s agent. During the period of voluntary administration, there is a moratorium on claims by the company’s creditors, such that (with certain exceptions) no proceedings against the company, or in relation to the company’s property, can be commenced or continued with, and no enforcement processes can begin or proceed other than with, the consent of the administrator or the court. Similarly, a secured creditor cannot enforce their security interest over the property of the company except with the consent of the administrator or the court, unless the secured creditor holds a security interest over the whole or substantially the whole of the company’s property and enforces the security interest in relation to all property subject to the security interest within 13 business days following the appointment of the administrator. During a voluntary administration, the voluntary administrator must convene at least two meetings of creditors. At the second creditors’ meeting, creditors will be asked to vote on whether the company should execute a Deed of Company Arrangement if one is proposed (see below), be wound up (see below) or revert to the control of its directors. That decision is made by the company’s creditors (by a majority in number and value) at a meeting convened by the administrator. If the vote is split between value and number, the administrator, which generally chairs the meeting of creditors has a casting vote on the outcome. The voluntary administration ends when the company executes a Deed of Company Arrangement or the creditors resolve that it be wound up or revert to the control of its directors.",N/A,as_expected,2024,879

Australian insolvency laws will be relevant upon the insolvency of this entity and the,1447.21.2,Deed of Company Arrangement,"A Deed of Company Arrangement is a deed, which binds the deed administrators, company, its officers, its members, its unsecured creditors (whether or not they voted in favor of it) and its secured creditors (who voted in favor of it). Secured creditors who do not vote in favor of the deed of company arrangement will generally not be bound by its terms. The content of a Deed of Company Arrangement will depend on the proposal, which is put to vote at the second creditors’ meeting held during the voluntary administration procedure. A Deed of Company Arrangement will generally provide for the restructure or rehabilitation of the company usually by compromising claims against the company in exchange for a distribution to creditors. There are few restrictions under Australian law on the content of a Deed of Company Arrangement—a Deed of Company Arrangement may provide for the realization of assets, the orderly winding down of the company’s business, the pursuit of litigation for the benefit of creditors, and/or the compromise of claims against the company. It will often also provide for a moratorium on claims against the company for the period during which the Deed of Company Arrangement operates. 494 ----- A Deed of Company Arrangement can be terminated in accordance with its terms, by an order of an Australian court, or in certain circumstances by resolution of the company’s creditors. The consequences of termination will depend on the terms of the deed, orders made by a Court (if applicable), or the particulars of any resolution put to creditors. Two common consequences of termination are: - that the company is wound up (for example, if the deed has not been performed, the Court makes orders terminating the deed or the creditors pass a resolution terminating the deed and that the company be wound up); or - that the company returns to the control of its directors and officers (if the deed has been performed).",N/A,as_expected,2024,879

Australian insolvency laws will be relevant upon the insolvency of this entity and the,1447.21.3,Receivership,"Receivership is a form of non-terminal insolvency process, under which a receiver (or receiver and manager) is appointed in respect of a company to take control of or get in specific property, so as to protect the rights of a party (usually a secured creditor) entitled to that property. Receivers are usually appointed privately by a secured creditor in accordance with the terms of a security document. In certain limited circumstances, receivers may also be appointed by a court on application of a party seeking to protect its interests. A receivership can occur concurrently with a voluntary administration, Deed of Company Arrangement or a winding up. Where a receivership occurs concurrently with a voluntary administration, the administrator’s powers are subject to the functions and powers of the receiver. Where a receivership occurs concurrently with a winding up (or liquidation), the receiver’s powers are not diminished, although there may be some restrictions on the extent to which the receiver may exercise those powers, including due to a subsequent liquidation terminating the receiver’s agency of the company. The manner of a receiver’s appointment will depend on the terms of the charge or security document under which the receiver is appointed. Depending on the extent of the assets securing the company’s obligation and the terms of the charge, the secured creditor will usually have the ability to appoint either a receiver or a receiver and manager. A receiver is charged with the realization or management of the secured asset over which he or she has been appointed. A receiver and manager is empowered to take control of the debtor’s business as a going concern for the purpose of repayment of the secured debt, either through realization of the debtor’s assets or through the income generated by the debtor’s business. For the purposes of this offering memorandum, there is no distinction between receivers and receivers and managers, so the term “receivers” is used to describe both types of appointment. A receiver’s powers are determined by the terms of the security under which she or he is appointed and certain laws (including the Corporations Act), but will generally be very broad and will usually include the power to enter into possession and control of the secured property, lease or sell the property, and, in the case of a receiver and manager, to carry on the business of the debtor and do all things, which the debtor is normally empowered to do. In carrying on the business of the debtor the receiver generally acts as agent of the company. A receiver owes its primary duty to the secured creditor who appointed them. The Corporations Act also imposes certain statutory duties on a receiver in the conduct of its administration of the debtor’s assets. Of primary importance within these duties is that imposed by 420A of the Corporations Act, which obliges receivers to take reasonable care to ensure that, if sold, the secured assets are sold for market value or, if there is no market value, for the best price reasonably obtainable in the circumstances. Receivers are also officers of the company and therefore, are subject to the officers’ duties imposed by the Corporations Act and the law generally. 495 ----- While the directors and officers of the debtor are not formally displaced by the appointment of a receiver or receiver and manager, the powers of the receiver supersede those of the existing company management and will usually result in the directors and officers being left without an active role in relation to the secured property (which can include the entire operation of the company). The directors are generally required to provide the receiver with reports as to the company’s affairs and to cooperate with the receiver to the extent necessary to achieve the purposes of the receivership. In the normal course, a privately-appointed receivership will terminate where the purpose for which the receiver was appointed has been achieved. This will usually be the repayment of the debt owed to the secured creditor. If there are insufficient assets held by the debtor to repay the secured debt in full, the receivership will terminate when the receiver exhausts all of the available assets of the debtor pursuant to which the receiver is appointed and retires. On termination of the receivership (assuming there is not also a voluntary administration or winding up process on foot), control of the debtor and all of its remaining assets (if any) are returned to the debtor’s directors and officers.",N/A,as_expected,2024,879

Australian insolvency laws will be relevant upon the insolvency of this entity and the,1447.21.4,Winding up,"A winding-up (or liquidation) is a terminal insolvency process by which a company’s affairs are brought to an end, and its assets are distributed among its creditors and (if there is a surplus after creditors are paid) its members. A winding up most commonly occurs where a company is insolvent, and is commenced: - where a court makes an order that the company be wound up in insolvency (or for some other reason); - by resolution of the company’s members (known as a creditors’ voluntary winding up if the company is insolvent); or - by resolution of the company’s creditors at the second creditors’ meeting in a voluntary administration. It is also possible for a company to be wound up on a solvent basis, most commonly because its members wish it to cease trading and have their capital returned (known as a members’ voluntary winding up). During a winding up (subject to contrary order of the court): - individual claimants are stayed from litigating their claims in court and instead must lodge a proof of debt with the liquidator—in order to achieve this, a stay is imposed to prevent the assets of the company being wasted by litigation; - the leave of a court must be obtained in order to bring or continue proceedings against a company, or in relation to the property of the company; and - enforcement processes in relation to the property of the company cannot be begun or continued against a company, although a secured creditor does not require the leave of the court to deal with the property the subject of a security interest. During liquidation, unsecured creditors have a right to vote at any creditors’ meetings and are entitled to participate in the distribution of a fund of assets protected and properly administered. Secured creditors generally retain the right to enforce their security and may elect to appoint a receiver. Where a receivership and liquidation occur concurrently, a liquidator will generally not have power to deal with the company’s assets that are the subject of a valid security interest in favor of the secured creditor. 496 ----- Once appointed, a liquidator is able to bring proceedings, among other things, against persons in relation to “voidable transactions,” pursuant to section 588FE(1) of the Corporations Act. The most commonly prosecuted “voidable transaction” claims, and their relevance to holders of Notes, are discussed further in the limitations section below. The proceeds of successful claims will be available for distribution to the company’s creditors. After collecting the assets and finalization of the process of calling for proofs of debt and adjudicating those proofs by the liquidator (and the time for receipt of proofs of debt having expired), the liquidator can pay a dividend to creditors. Depending upon the complexity and size of the company, liquidation can last for several years and the liquidator may declare several interim dividends over that time. Section 556(1) of the Corporations Act provides a prescribed order (commonly referred to as a “waterfall”) for the payment of unsecured debts and claims against the company, which in summary is as follows: - secured creditors (although certain employee priority and other priority expenses may be paid in priority to secured creditors with a circulating security interest in respect of circulating assets such as inventory); then - expenses of the winding-up (including the fees and expenses of the liquidator and any prior voluntary administrator or deed administrator); then - unpaid wages, unpaid superannuation contributions, and other priority employee entitlements (persons who advance funds to pay those claims have the priorities for those payments, which the employees otherwise enjoy); then - the claims of ordinary unsecured creditors; then finally - the claims of shareholders. In the case of winding-up, the final step to be taken in the process is the deregistration of the company. The steps for deregistration are governed by the Corporations Act and once deregistered the company ceases to exist and the liquidator’s role comes to an end. On January 1, 2021, a simplified liquidation process for small companies with liabilities less than $1 million was introduced in Australia. The aim of the process is to streamline a liquidation by, among other things, reducing regulatory and creditor reporting requirements, reducing rights of liquidators to clawback unfair preference payments from unrelated creditors and removing creditors meetings and other creditor rights available in a general liquidation.",N/A,as_expected,2024,879

Australian insolvency laws will be relevant upon the insolvency of this entity and the,1447.21.5,Scheme of arrangement,"A scheme of arrangement is a court approved compromise or arrangement between a company and its creditors or members. Schemes can be utilized by companies to provide for a modification or adjustment of the rights of the company’s creditors or members, which, if approved, will be binding on all creditors or members. In brief, there are two different types of schemes: members’ schemes and creditors’ schemes. Before either type of scheme can be implemented it must be approved by the court, ASIC and the members or creditors of the company. A members’ scheme will inevitably involve some restructuring of the company and the rights and obligations of its members. Once approved, the scheme will be binding on all members (including dissenting members). A creditors’ scheme will often involve a proposal to defer, compromise or extinguish the company’s debts—a typical scenario would involve a moratorium in respect of claims against the company and a 497 ----- compromise of debts owed by it (and/or a modification of the rights of creditors or a class of them in relation to the company). Once approved, the scheme will be binding on all creditors (including dissenting creditors). A creditors’ scheme needs to be approved by each class of affected creditors (in each case by a voting majority constituting 75% in value and majority in number). Unlike a deed of company arrangement, schemes of arrangement can bind secured creditors and owners and lessors in respect of their property and can release third party claims. Schemes are extremely flexible and can be utilized to implement any arrangement relating to the rights and obligations of the company and its creditors, save that a scheme, which is contrary to law, or not in the public interest, is unlikely to be approved by the court (even if it has the support of members and/or creditors).",N/A,as_expected,2024,879

Part 5.3B was introduced by the Corporations Amendment (Corporate Insolvency Reforms) Act 2020 (Cth) with effect from January 1, 2021. The company the subject of the restructure generally retains control of the conduct of the company’s business, property and affairs during the restructuring process. A restructuring practitioner is appointed to advise the company on the restructuring process, assist in the preparation of a restructuring plan, and make certain declarations to creditors in relation to the restructuring plan proposed to creditors. Similar moratoria on enforcement and other action, which can be taken by creditors and other third parties generally apply in relation to a restructuring process under Part 5.3B of the Corporations Act, as apply under a voluntary administration.

Australian insolvency laws will be relevant upon the insolvency of this entity and the,1447.21.7,Summary of limitations on the validity and enforceability of Note Guarantee and security interests provided by Australian Guarantor under Australian law,"_General_ Under Australian law, the enforceability of the Note Guarantee and security interests provided by the Australian Guarantor is subject to various limitations, some of which are summarized below. _Breach of Directors’ Duties_ The decision to provide the Note Guarantee and/or security interests by the Australian Guarantor may be found to have been in breach of the duties owed by the directors of the Australian Guarantor, including the duty to act in good faith in the best interests of the Australian Guarantor, and for a proper purpose. If a Court were to find that the directors of the Australian Guarantor breached those duties in connection with providing the Note Guarantee and/or security interests it provided, in certain circumstances, they may become voidable. If the Note Guarantee from the Australian Guarantor is avoided, it is possible that holders of Notes would be left with a claim solely against the Issuer and the other Guarantors. _Personal Properties Securities Act 2009 (Cth)_ 498 ----- In Australia, the _Personal Properties Securities Act 2009 (Cth) (the “PPSA”) establishes a national system for the registration of security interests, a system of priority and other provisions, which will affect most collateral classes (described as “personal property” under the PPSA) other than interests in land, fixtures attached to land, statutory licenses and general law liens. Perfection of security interests granted by an Australian entity or granted by any entity over assets located in Australia, which (in each case) are deemed “personal property” for the purposes of the PPSA (“Australian PPSA Collateral”) is achieved through registration on a central register established under the PPSA and known as the Personal Property Securities Register (the “PPSR”), or the secured party having possession or control of Australian PPSA Collateral. Among other things, security interests perfected by control over certain financial assets (for example bank accounts held with an authorized deposit taking institution, shares and letters of credit), subject to limited exceptions, would rank in priority over prior registered secured interests (like those of the holders of Notes) regardless of notice. In certain circumstances, purchasers and lessees of Australian PPSA Collateral can acquire it free of a security interest even when they had notice of that security interest. Generally, where a security interest over personal property is granted by means of a security agreement, then (unless perfection occurs by possession or control), a failure to register that security interest on the PPSR within the first to occur of 20 business days after signing of the security agreement and the company entering into insolvency or, if later, at least six months before the commencement of a winding-up or administration of the grantor of that security interest, will result in that security interest vesting in the grantor, such that the secured party’s interest will in effect no longer exist and will not be enforceable. Also, the secured creditor’s priority may be adversely affected, as perfected security interests generally take priority over unperfected security interests and third parties leasing or taking transfer of the collateral will generally take free of all unperfected security interests. _Risks Arising in a Winding-Up Voidable transactions_ If the Australian Guarantor is subject to a winding up, the liquidator may apply to an Australian Court for orders that the entry into the Note Guarantee and/or security interests by the Australian Guarantor or a transaction in connection with the Note Guarantee and/or security interests by the Australian Guarantor constitutes a voidable transaction and should be set aside. The most commonly brought voidable transactions claims include the following: - an “unfair preference,” (sections 588FA and 588FC of the Corporations Act) being a transaction between the company and a creditor carried out at a time when the company was insolvent (or the company became insolvent as a result of the transaction) that results in the creditor receiving from the company, in respect of an unsecured debt, more than the creditor would receive on a winding up of the company if the transaction were set aside; - an “uncommercial transaction,” (sections 588FB and 588FC of the Corporations Act) being a transaction carried on at a time the company was insolvent (or the company became insolvent as a result of the transaction) that a reasonable person in the company’s position would not have entered into, having regard to the benefits and detriment to the company of entering into the transaction, the benefits to the other parties to the transaction of entering into it and any other relevant matters; - an “unreasonable director-related transaction” or an “unfair loan” (sections 588FDA and 588FD, respectively, of the Corporations Act); or - a “creditor-defeating disposition,” (section 588FDB of the Corporations Act) being a disposition of property of a company where (a) the consideration payable to the company was less than the lesser of (i) the market value of the property and (ii) the best price reasonably 499 ----- obtainable, and (b) the disposition has the effect of preventing the property from becoming available for the benefit of the company’s creditors in a winding-up or hindering, or significantly delaying, the process of making the property so available. _Green security_ A security interest granted by the company in respect of “circulating assets” in the 6 month period leading up to the liquidator’s appointment or, if the liquidation was preceded by voluntary administration then the commencement of the voluntary administration, will be void except so far as the security interest secures: - a new advance (other than an advance to discharge an unsecured debt owed to the secured party which must be given as consideration for the circulating security interest); - interest on such an advance; - the amount of a liability (e.g. under a guarantee) undertaken at or after that time on behalf of, or for the benefit of, the company; or - an amount payable for property services supplied to the company at or after that time or interest on an amount so payable. The security interest will not be void if the company is proven to have been solvent immediately after the time it granted the security interest. _Impact of the above on entry by the Australian Guarantor into the Note Guarantee and/or security interests_ The extent to which the entry into the Note Guarantee and/or security interests by the Australian Guarantor is susceptible to challenge on the bases set out above depends, among other things, on when the relevant transaction was entered into relative to the commencement of the winding up (or, if a voluntary administration precedes the winding up, the commencement of the voluntary administration). Different time periods apply depending on the circumstances of the relevant transaction and the identity of the parties to it. _Ipso facto reforms_ On September 18, 2017, the Treasury Laws Amendment (2017 Enterprise Incentives No. 2) Act 2017 (“TLA Act”) was enacted in Australia. With effect from July 1, 2018, this legislation introduced new provisions into the Corporations Act, which provide for an automatic stay on the enforcement of certain rights and self-executing provisions (known as “ipso facto” rights) arising under certain contracts (such as a right entitling a creditor to terminate the contract or to accelerate payments or providing for automatic acceleration) (“Automatic Stay”), if the reason for the enforcement of those rights or provisions is: (a) the contractual counterparty being under administration, having a managing controller or receiver appointed over the whole or substantially the whole of its property, or announcing, applying for or being the subject of a scheme of arrangement (for the purpose of it avoiding being wound up in insolvency), or being under a restructuring process under Part 5.3B of the Corporations Act; (b) the contractual counterparty’s financial position during any of those affected procedures; or (c) a reason that is in substance contrary to the TLA Act (known as “prescribed reasons”). 500 ----- Notably, the procedures under which the Automatic Stay would apply do not include being subject to winding up or liquidation (unless those processes are consequent to a voluntary administration or a scheme) or where a deed of company arrangement has been executed (unless the deed administrators are able to obtain a court order for a stay to operate) or the restructuring process under Part 5.3B ends. Relevantly, the Automatic Stay does not apply to other types of contractual defaults – for example, if the company has failed to meet its payment or other performance obligations under the relevant agreement. The length of the Automatic Stay depends on which formal insolvency process applies to the company, as follows (subject to courts order extending the stay): - in the case of a scheme of arrangement: the stay will end within three months of the announcement, or where an application is made within that three months, when the application is withdrawn or dismissed by the court or when the scheme ends or the company is would up; - in the case of a receivership or managing controllership: the stay will end when the receiver’s or managing controller’s control ends; and - in the case of a voluntary administration: the stay will end on the latest of when the administration ends or the company is would up. The scope of the Automatic Stay, specifically what contract types, rights and self-executing provisions are excluded by the Automatic Stay are set out in the Corporations (Stay on Enforcing Certain Rights) _Regulations 2018 (“Regulations”) and the_ _Corporations (Stay on Enforcing Certain Rights) Declaration 2018 (“Declaration”)._ The Declaration declares the various rights (including self-executing clauses that, when executed, provide those rights) that are excluded from the operation of the Automatic Stay and those rights that remain available to the parties should a trigger event occur. The Automatic Stay applies to ipso facto rights arising under contracts, agreements or arrangements entered into at or after July 1, 2018, subject to certain exclusions set out in the Corporations Act, subordinate regulations and a Declaration related to the TLA Act that also came into effect on July 1, 2018. The subordinate regulations prescribe that a right contained in a kind of contract, agreement or arrangement for the underwriting of an issue, or sale, of bonds or that is, or governs, bonds, is not subject to the Automatic Stay. Rights exercised with the consent of the relevant administrator, managing controller, scheme administrator, restructuring practitioner (or a liquidator if a liquidation follows the administration or scheme) and the right to appoint a controller (in respect of security over the whole or substantially the whole property) during the decision period following the appointment of administrators are excluded. In addition to the exclusions currently applicable as a result of related subordinate regulations and the Declaration that came into effect on July 1, 2018, rights prescribed by regulations or Ministerial declarations following July 1, 2018 may also be excluded. Any such subordinate legislation that may be implemented following July 1, 2018 may also prescribe additional reasons to which the automatic stay on enforcement applies. The Automatic Stay does not apply retrospectively (i.e., for agreements entered into prior to the new provisions coming into force on 1 July 2018). The ipso facto legislation also gives the Court the power to impose stay orders in respect of a potentially broader range of contractual rights (where the court is satisfied that the relevant right is being exercised, is likely to be exercised or there is a threat that it might be exercised because of one of the prescribed reasons described above) or lift the Automatic Stay (where the Court is satisfied that doing so is in the interests of justice) and extend the duration of the Automatic Stay. 501 ----- The effect of the _ipso facto reforms means that, in the event of a Guarantor being subject to the appointment of a voluntary administrator, a managing controller over the whole or substantially the whole of its property or a scheme of arrangement (for the purpose of avoiding it being wound up in insolvency), the rights of any counterparty to a contract with a Guarantor that would otherwise be enlivened by those insolvency events (or triggered by its financial position whilst affected by one of those affected procedures) may be unenforceable. This may affect the exercise of rights under the Note Guarantee provided by the Australian Guarantor as against the Australian Guarantor. Until judicial consideration of the new provisions of the Corporations Act as introduced by the TLA Act, the subordinate regulations and the Declaration and any changes in market practice, the scope of the _ipso facto reform and its potential effect on the Note Guarantee provided by the Australian Guarantor remains uncertain. 502 -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,879

There are four main forms of formal insolvency processes in Australia: voluntary administration, deed of company arrangement, receivership and winding-up (also called liquidation).

It was incorporated and registered in England and Wales on 8 December 2021. The address of its registered office is 2 Minster Court, Mincing Lane, London, EC3R 7PD. These interim condensed consolidated financial statements comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (the Group) and have been prepared in connection with the shareholders’ deed, the USD 500.0m PIK toggle notes due 2027 indenture and the privately placed term loan facilities agreement due 2026 (incorporating the term, CAR and RCF facilities). A newly created company Tara Topco Limited (‘Tara’) obtained a significant new equity investment led by long-term shareholders in the former Ardonagh holding company, The Ardonagh Group Limited (‘TAGL’), alongside new co-investors through accounts managed by MDP and HPS. The new equity investment resulted in TAGL merging into Tara on 31 May 2022. Following this merger, the Company acquired Ardonagh New Midco 3 Limited (‘NM3L’), including the group of companies previously owned by TAGL, on 1 June 2022 and the Ardonagh Group activities are thereafter overseen by the Company as an indirect subsidiary of Tara. The prior period comparatives therefore reflect the fact that during the nine-month period to 30 September 2022 the Company had only four months of trading. As announced on 15 September, Ardonagh and Markerstudy Group (‘Markerstudy’) have agreed a merger between Markerstudy and Ardonagh’s Atlanta Group of businesses to create a major new player in the UK insurance market with the transaction subject to customary conditions (including regulatory approvals). Owing to the forthcoming merger, the financial information presented in this interim report is shown to identify the impact of Ardonagh Retail ceasing to be part of Ardonagh.

The Group reported an operating profit of £76.5m (2021: £102.7m) for the year ended 31 December 2022, net cash inflows from operating activities of £171.1m (2021: £688.5m), net decrease/(increase) in cash and cash equivalents of £118.0m (2021: £754.1m). Available cash of £269.6m (2021: £411.3m) was reported on 31 December 2022. The Directors have assessed the Group’s financial position and its ability to meet its obligations as and when they fall due. In making the going concern assessment the Directors have taken into account the following: - The Group’s capital structure, operations and liquidity. - Base case and stressed cash flow forecasts over the calendar years 2023 and 2024. - The impact on the base case and stressed cashflow forecasts arising from material acquisitions and capital injections subsequent to year end. - The principal risks facing the Group. and its systems of risk management and internal control. - The Group’s capital management, among other things, aims to ensure that it meets financial covenants attached to its interest-bearing loans and borrowings. There have been no breaches of the financial covenants of any interest-bearing loans and borrowing in the reporting period. - Post year-end operating results and cashflows of the Group continue to be positive. Key assumptions that the Directors have reflected in the base case cash flow forecasts include that: - The Group will continue to benefit from a £191.5m Revolving Credit Facility that is not drawn at the date of this report. - Client retention and renewal rates remain robust, despite the current economic uncertainty, as the 2022 trading performance continues to demonstrate resilience across the Group. - Interest costs are modelled using current forward interest and FX rates (other than where interest rates on debt have been fixed through interest rate swaps). ###### FINANCIAL STATEMENTS",N/A,as_expected,2024,879

In making the going concern assessment the Directors have taken into account the following: - The Group’s capital structure, operations and liquidity. - Base case and stressed cash flow forecasts over the calendar years 2023 and 2024. - The impact on the base case and stressed cashflow forecasts arising from subsequent material acquisitions and as a result of Ardonagh Retail ceasing to be part of Ardonagh following the expected merger between Markerstudy and Ardonagh’s Atlanta Group of businesses. - The principal risks facing the Group. and its systems of risk management and internal control. - The Group’s capital management, among other things, aims to ensure that it meets financial covenants attached to its interest-bearing loans and borrowings. There have been no breaches of the financial covenants of any interest-bearing loans and borrowings in the current period. - Actual trading and cashflows of the period and the continued positive results in October 2023. Key assumptions that the Directors have reflected in the base case cash flow forecasts include that: - The Group will continue to benefit from a £191.5m Revolving Credit Facility that is not drawn at the date of this report. - Client retention and renewal rates remain robust, despite current economic uncertainties, with the trading performance continuing to demonstrate resilience across the Group. - Interest costs are modelled using current forward interest rates (other than where interest rates on debt have been fixed through interest rate swaps). Key stress scenarios that the Directors have considered include cumulative stresses to the base plan as a result of: - Shortfalls in base case projected income throughout 2023 and 2024. - Deterioration in base case cash conversion rates over and above the shortfalls in income. - An inflationary cost increase of 2% over the base case assumptions. - Additional interest costs on the term and CAR debt facilities applying the maximum additional margins that can be triggered. - Mitigating actions within management control including delayed capital expenditure, a reduction in discretionary spend and measured reductions in employee headcount and remuneration. The Directors have also modelled reverse stress scenarios, including assessing those that result in a default on the Group’s term debt facilities that would require a technical repayment obligation and those that would exhaust available liquidity. The stresses needed for these outcomes to happen significantly exceed the key stress scenarios above and the Directors consider such conditions to be a remote possibility. Other mitigations which may be possible in the stress scenarios but have not been included in the analysis include seeking shareholder support, securitising premium receivables and further incremental and more prolonged cost reductions. The Directors continue to consider the wider operational and financial consequences and ramifications of global political and economic tensions (including related to the Ukrainian conflict, foreign exchange rates, inflation and increasing interest rates). In particular: - Insurance broking is a resilient and defensive market, which has historically had limited impact from past economic or capital market downturns. The Group is highly diversified and not unduly exposed to a single carrier, customer or market sector. - Although economic developments remain fluid, the stress testing demonstrates the Group’s financial resilience and operating flexibility. - As a result of Russia invading Ukraine, we have seen significant new sanctions legislation from a range of legislators (including the US, EU and UK), with newly sanctioned entities and individuals, and new (or wider in scope) sectoral sanctions targeting Russia (and Belarus). The Ardonagh Group has no appetite for potential breaches of applicable sanctions regimes and applies appropriate controls including automated screening of clients against relevant sanctions lists. We continue to actively monitor the situation as it develops and will respond accordingly as new sanctions are enacted. - The Group continues to monitor the risk of cyber-attacks, but the Group has not identified any significant security risks during the period ended 30 September 2023. Following the assessment of the Group’s financial position and its ability to meet its obligations as and when they fall due, including the further potential financial implications of economic uncertainty included in stress tests, the Directors are not aware of any material uncertainties that cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. ----- ###### FINANCIAL STATEMENTS",N/A,as_expected,2024,879

1923_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,1447,CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS,1447.58,Critical judgements in applying accounting policies,1447.58.1,,"The Company obtained control of NM3L on 1 June 2022, which is the owner of Ardonagh Midco 1 Limited (Midco 1) and thus the businesses that were previously part of the Ardonagh Group that existed prior to 1 June 2022 headed by The Ardonagh Group Limited. For the year ended 31 December 2022, the Company applied acquisition accounting in accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations to the acquisition of NM3L and, in the consolidated financial statements of the Group, it therefore measured the identifiable net assets acquired of NM3L at fair value on 1 June 2022, which included the recognition of intangible assets arising on a business combination and the recognition of goodwill and non-controlling interests. A critical judgement was applied in the prior year to determine if it was appropriate to apply acquisition accounting, which included consideration of the wider transaction, if there had been a change in control, and who was the acquirer. Acquisition accounting was applied as a business had been acquired and because the Company clearly obtained control of that business. As at 31 December 2022, the Group had not completed the acquisition accounting of NM3L. Goodwill recognised in the prior year’s consolidated financial statements was based on provisional fair values of the assets acquired. The initial allocation of goodwill to the cash generating units was also done on a provisional basis in accordance with IAS 36. During the current year, the Group completed the acquisition accounting of NM3L, and the resulting amount of goodwill has been finalised and reallocated to cashgenerating units in a manner that is most appropriate to the business. During 2023, the Group entered into negotiations to dispose of the entire share capital of Atlanta Investment Holdings 3 Limited (‘AIH3L’), being the holding company for the Retail operating segment (the ‘disposal group’). On 1 September 2023, all material matters fundamental to the deal were agreed upon with the buyer and there were no further matters that could have caused the planned sale to be withdrawn or changed significantly. Consequently, as at that date the disposal group was classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations. At that date, the carrying values of all assets and liabilities within the disposal group were measured in accordance with applicable IFRS and then compared to the fair value less cost to sell of the disposal group. The excess, if any, of the carrying value of the disposal group over its fair value less cost to sell is required to be recognised as an impairment loss. There was no material difference between the carrying value and the fair value less cost to sell of the disposal group and therefore no impairment loss was recognised. Furthermore, in accordance with IFRS 5, from the date of classification as held for sale, non-current assets within the disposal group are not subject to depreciation or amortisation. ----- ###### FINANCIAL STATEMENTS",N/A,as_expected,2024,879

Other assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may exceed its recoverable amount. The last annual impairment test was performed as at 1 July 2023 (see note 8). An impairment test of an asset or cash-generating unit (or group of cash-generating units) is performed by comparing its carrying amount with its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use, where its value in use is the present value of its future cash flows. An impairment test requires the application of significant judgement because it relies on key assumptions, including forecast cash flows, a discount rate, a terminal growth rate and an Adjusted EBITDA multiple. Accordingly, the resulting estimates are significant estimates because there is a significant risk of a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of affected balances within the next financial year. Goodwill arising from a new business combination is, for the purposes of impairment testing, allocated to those cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the goodwill that was acquired. Impairment testing is performed at the level of the smallest groups of cash-generating units at which goodwill is monitored, known as the divisions. Forecast cash flows used in the value in use calculation were determined by considering historic business performance, by overlaying it with assumptions to reflect areas where growth or income improvement was expected, and by taking into account the expected results of cost management programmes to which the Group was committed. These forecasts were extrapolated to subsequent years using a steady growth rate being the CPI inflation rate of 2%, and a terminal value was calculated using the perpetual growth model. The discount rate of 9.55% to 11.45% that was applied to the forecasts was a market participant weighted average cost of capital calculated by reference to the Capital Asset Pricing Model. The fair value of the Group was calculated based on multiples of forecast 2024 Adjusted EBITDA and on information provided by external advisors, where that information is based on recent transactions in the insurance broking industry. The fair value of a division was estimated by apportioning the fair value of the Group between the divisions based on the value in use of each division. The estimated costs of disposal are assumed, based on market experience, to be 1.5% of the fair value of the division. See note 8 for the carrying values of goodwill and intangible assets at the period end. Further, As at 30 September 2023, there were no indications of impairment and therefore no impairment test has been performed.",N/A,as_expected,2024,879

Under IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’, the Group determines and presents operating segments based on the information that is provided to the Group Executive Committee, which is the Group’s chief operating decision maker. Operating segments are reviewed and revised as necessary following structural changes within the Group or on significant business combinations. The Group Executive Committee assesses the performance of the operating segments based on an Adjusted EBITDA measure and cash generation forecasts to meet debt obligations to the Corporate segment. The presentation of the segment information reflects that. The Group Executive Committee assesses the financial position of the Group on a consolidated Group basis and therefore does not regularly receive measures of total assets or total liabilities on an operating segment basis. Accordingly, no financial position measures are reported within the Group’s segmental analysis. The results include items directly attributable to an operating segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis. The Retail segment was classified as a discontinued operation in the current period and segment information reported on the next pages does not include any amounts for discontinued operations, which are described in more detail in note 26. Of the Total Income disclosed in the consolidated income statement, £498.7m (2022; £159.3m) is attributable to sales made to clients outside the UK. Commissions and fees represent the Group’s revenue from contracts with customers which is recognised in accordance with IFRS 15.

The effective tax rate in these interim condensed consolidated financial statements is 9.9% giving rise to a tax credit on continuing operations of £25.3m. The tax charge differs from that which would result from applying the standard rate of corporation tax, mainly due to the impact of non-UK earnings, statutory restrictions on the deductibility of interest expense and the recognition of deferred tax assets against future projections of taxable income. The tax charge on discontinued operations in these interim condensed consolidated financial statements is £6.7m. This includes a one-off tax charge of £3.9m which has arisen due to the classification of the disposal group as held for sale. The Group has adopted International Tax Reform – Pillar Two Model Rules – Amendments to IAS 12 upon their release on 23 May 2023. The amendments provide a temporary mandatory exception from deferred tax accounting for the top-up tax, which is effective immediately, and require new disclosures about the Pillar Two exposure from 31 December 2023. The mandatory exception applies retrospectively. However, because no new legislation to implement the top-up tax was enacted or substantively enacted at 31 December 2022 in any jurisdiction in which the Group operates and no related deferred taxes were recognised at that date, the retrospective application has no impact on the Group’s condensed interim financial statements. The relief and the new disclosures will also be reflected in the Group’s consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ending 31 December 2023. ----- ###### FINANCIAL STATEMENTS",N/A,as_expected,2024,879

Opinion In our opinion: - the financial statements of Ardonagh Midco 2 Plc (the ‘parent company’) and its subsidiaries (the ‘group’) give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 31 December 2022 and of the group’s loss for the year then ended; - the group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom adopted international accounting standards; - the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice, including Financial Reporting Standard 101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework”; and - the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006. We have audited the financial statements which comprise: - the consolidated statement of profit and loss and other comprehensive income; - the consolidated and parent company statements of financial position; - the consolidated and parent company statements of changes in equity; - the consolidated statement of cash flows; and - the related notes 1 to 35 to the consolidated financial statements and 1 to 13 to the parent company financial statements. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the group financial statements is applicable law, and United Kingdom adopted international accounting standards. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the parent company financial statements is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including FRS 101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework” (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice). ###### 2. Basis for opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the group and the parent company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the Financial Reporting Council’s (the ‘FRC’s’) Ethical Standard as applied to listed entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. ----- ###### INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF ARDONAGH MIDCO 2 PLC Report on the audit of the financial statements 3. Summary of our audit approach Key audit matters The key audit matters that we identified in the current period were: - Acquisition accounting under IFRS 3 Business Combinations – Ed Broking Group Limited, Besso Insurance Group Limited - Presentation of Alternative Performance Measures (‘APMs’); and - Goodwill impairment. Materiality The materiality that we used for the group financial statements was £9m which was determined on the basis of 0.76% of revenue. Scoping Scoping coverage included 7 components subject to full scope audits and a further 17 subject to the audit of specified account balances. These scoped in entities represent 77% of revenue and 73% of insurance debtors. Significant changes in our approach In the current year, we no longer consider the following as key audit matters: - Going concern was removed as a key audit matter following improvement in the group’s operating profit and an improved liquidity position. - We re-visited our risk assessment on revenue recognition in the group and no longer consider the risk associated with the acquisition of Swinton to be a key audit matter. - The Preference share issue: classification as debt or equity was a one-off event in 2021 and is not applicable in 2022. ###### 4. Conclusions relating to going concern In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate. Our evaluation of the directors’ assessment of the group and the parent company’s ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting included: - Gained an understanding of management’s process and controls for performing the going concern assessment. - Challenged key assumptions underpinning cash flow forecasts, the stresses applied and the reverse stress test by performing an analysis and comparison of actual performance versus prior period going concern forecasts to assess management’s ability to forecast. - Performed a sensitivity analyses over management’s forecasts for interest rate volatility and inflation to assess the appropriatness of the headroom. - Inspected correspondence between the group and its regulators. ----- ###### INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF ARDONAGH MIDCO 2 PLC Report on the audit of the financial statements - Performed an analysis of the group’s financial performance in the first five months after the balance sheet date. - Assessed financial statement disclosures in respect of going concern for transparency and inclusion of all facts and circumstances of which we are aware through the performance of the audit work. Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the group's and parent company’s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue. Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections of this report. ###### 5. Key audit matters Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we identified. These matters included those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. 5.1 Acquisition accounting under IFRS 3 Business combinations – Ed Broking Group Limited, Besso Insurance Group Limited Key audit matter description On 1 November 2021 the group acquired the entire issued share capital of Ed Broking Group Limited and Besso Insurance Group Limited (“Ed, Besso”). This transaction constituted a business combination under IFRS 3 Business combinations, and resulted in the recognition of £250m of goodwill and £130m separately acquired intangible assets. Management engaged a third-party expert to perform an independent fair value assessment of the acquired intangible assets at the valuation date and perform the Purchase Price Allocation (“PPA”) for financial reporting purposes. Management had 12 months from the date of acquisition to finalise the acquisition accounting. This period elapsed during 2022 and the numbers reported in respect of this acquisition are final. Transactions that constitute a business combination under IFRS 3 must be accounted for by applying the acquisition method, so that the assets and liabilities assumed are recognised by the acquirer at their acquisition-date fair values. Key steps in the acquisition method that were completed during the year were: - Recognition and measurement of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed; and - Recognition and measurement of goodwill. The Ed, Besso acquisition is considered a key audit matter due to the scale of the transaction, the complexity of accounting due to the PPA approach, and the impact of these on the financial statements. Refer to Note 11 to the financial statements (Intangible assets). ----- ###### INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF ARDONAGH MIDCO 2 PLC Report on the audit of the financial statements How the scope of our audit responded to the key audit matter We have obtained an understanding of the relevant controls over management’s process for acquisition accounting. In addition, we performed the following audit procedures: - Assessed management’s projections, forecasts and accounting assumptions including the impact of a high inflation environment on the underlying cash flow assumptions, used in the fair value analysis. - Tested the completeness and accuracy of data inputs used in the valuation of goodwill and intangible assets. - Involved our valuation specialists in assessing the reasonableness of the key valuation assumptions and whether the valuation assumptions are consistent with what market participants would use in pricing the item. Key observations We are satisfied that the acquisition accounting under IFRS 3 Business combinations for Ed Broking Group Limited and Besso Insurance Group Limited is appropriate. 5.2 Presentation of Alternative Performance Measures (APMs) Key audit matter description Adjusted EBITDA is a key metric that management use to assess the quality of the group’s earnings. Management removes adjusting items (“Items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA”), being significant acquisition and disposal related items and other costs associated with the ongoing transformation of the group. Pro formas are presented as if the significant acquisition and disposal related transactions occurred on the first day of the comparative period. The group reports a Loss for the period of £280.8m, an EBITDA of £269.8m and Adjusted EBITDA of £373.4m in the Annual Report. This measure and other such non-GAAP measures used are Alternative Performance Measures (“APMs”). An APM is defined by European Securities and Markets Authority (“ESMA”) as “a financial measure of historical or future performance, financial position, or cash flows, other than a financial measure defined or specified in the applicable financial reporting framework (e.g. UK adopted IFRS) applied by the entity”. The group defines adjusting items in the Glossary in Section 3 of the Annual Report. A risk exists that these adjusting items are not consistently applied across the group. In addition, there is a risk that these adjusting items are not clearly disclosed in note 5 and that undue prominence is given to APMs compared to the statutory results of the group within the financial statements. Refer to section 1 of the Annual Report (Performance review) and section 3 of the Annual Report (Other unaudited financial information). ----- ###### INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF ARDONAGH MIDCO 2 PLC Report on the audit of the financial statements How the scope of our audit responded to the key audit matter We have obtained an understanding of the relevant controls over management’s process for APMs. In addition, we performed the following procedures: - Tested a sample of items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA to assess consistency with the group’s published definition and policies for these items; - Tested the accuracy of a sample of underlying expenses excluded from Adjusted EBITDA to invoices or other supporting evidence; - Assessed whether the use of APMs in the group’s financial statements is consistent with the guidelines produced by regulators; - Assessed whether there is appropriate balance between the use of statutory metrics, Adjusted EBITDA and other Pro Forma metrics, together with clear definitions and reconciliations within the Annual Report; - Assessed the prominence given to Adjusted EBITDA and other Pro Forma metrics relative to the group’s statutory results; and - Considered whether Adjusted EBITDA and other Pro Forma metrics were consistently applied in the current period’s financial statements. Key observations We considered that the group’s use and presentation of Alternative Performance Measures was acceptable and consistently applied. ----- ###### INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF ARDONAGH MIDCO 2 PLC Report on the audit of the financial statements 5.3 Goodwill impairment Key audit matter description Goodwill arising on business combinations is a significant asset on the balance sheet of the group £2,027m (2021: £1,620m). Goodwill increased significantly during 2022 following significant acquisitions including that of Ed Broking Group Limited and Besso Insurance Group Limited. As required by IAS 36 Impairment of Assets, goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually. During 2022 the group continued to monitor goodwill at the division level as this remained the lowest level of aggregation of cash generating units within the group at which goodwill could be monitored for management purposes. Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the recoverable amount of each division, using the higher of value in use (“VIU”) and fair value less costs to dispose (“FVLCD”). The VIU amount is subjective and calculated using an impairment model underpinned by key assumptions including forecast cash flows, discount rates and long-term growth rates. Management use a VIU approach to assess the recoverable amount of all divisions. A headroom calculation is performed as the amount of calculated VIU above the carrying value of the division. Divisions with less head room are at greater risk of impairment where the impairment model is sensitive to key assumptions. Management performed this assessment and concluded an impairment of £41m was required in the MGA division after the higher of value in use (“VIU”) and fair value less costs to dispose (“FVLCD”) calculated was less than the carrying amount of goodwill allocated to this division. Refer to Note 4 to the financial statements (Key sources of estimation uncertainty) and Note 11 to the financial statements (Intangible assets). How the scope of our audit responded to the key audit matter We have gained an understanding of management’s process for performing the annual impairment test and obtained an understanding of relevant controls. In addition, we performed the following audit procedures: - challenged management’s CGU assessment through assessing the level at which cash inflows are generated and the level at which goodwill is monitored; - challenged the assumptions used in the annual impairment review, in particular forecast growth rates applied to each of the divisions within the five year business plan through assessing segment strategies and planned business development; - tested the accuracy of the calculations behind management’s impairment model; - performed an assessment of actual FY 2022 cash flows against prior period forecasts to assess the accuracy of management’s forecasting; and - involved our valuation specialists to assess and challenge the discount rate used. ----- ###### INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF ARDONAGH MIDCO 2 PLC Report on the audit of the financial statements Key observations We agree with management’s conclusion that an impairment is required to the goodwill allocated to the MGA division as of the date of the impairment exercise. The forecasts used in the annual impairment exercise were consistent with the most recent financial forecasts approved by the Board. Key assumptions including discount rates and growth rates used within business forecasts are reasonable. ###### 6. Our application of materiality 6.1 Materiality We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work. Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows: Group financial statements Parent company financial statements Materiality £9m (2021: £9m) £8.1m (2021: £8.1m) Basis for determining materiality Rationale for the benchmark applied 0.76% of commission and fees (2021: 0.99% of commission and fees) Commission and fees was determined to be the key driver since it is the key metric for a number of the users of the financial statements. It is the best metric to show the growth of the group and is also the metric given the highest prominence in the strategic report. 0.79% of Parent company net assets (2021: 0.79% of Parent company net assets). We apply a materiality cap for the parent company to be lower than the group at 90%. (2021: 90%) Net assets was determined to be the materiality benchmark given the activities of the company. A nontrading holding company with principal activities being to hold intercompany subordinated debt and investment in subsidiaries. ----- ###### INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF ARDONAGH MIDCO 2 PLC Report on the audit of the financial statements Group Materiality £9m Commission and Component materiality range fees £1,118m £2.2m to 3.0m. Commission and fees Audit Committee Group materiality reporting threshold £0.45m 6.2 Performance materiality We set performance materiality at a level lower than materiality to reduce the probability that, in aggregate, uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceed the materiality for the financial statements as a whole. Group financial statements Parent company financial statements Performance materiality Basis and rationale for determining performance materiality 60% (2021: 60%) of group materiality 60% (2021: 60%) of parent company materiality In determining performance materiality, we considered our risk assessment which included our assessment of the group’s overall control environment. The group is still growing quickly and has a developing control environment, as such we decided to not rely on controls over a number of business processes and instead conduct a substantive audit. 6.3 Error reporting threshold We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess of £0.45m (2021 £0.45m), as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. We also report to the Audit Committee on disclosure matters that we identified when assessing the overall presentation of the financial statements. ----- ###### INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF ARDONAGH MIDCO 2 PLC Report on the audit of the financial statements 7 An overview of the scope of our Audit 7.1 Identification and scoping of components Our group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the group and its environment, including group-wide controls, and assessing the risks of material misstatement at the group level. Given the number of components and operating locations within the group, we assessed the extent of audit work required to be performed to give appropriate coverage for the purposes of the group financial statement audit. Our approach considered revenue contribution to the group result as a primary measure of financial significance and scope, and insurance debtors as a secondary balance sheet measure given the significance of the insurance debtors balance to the operational activities of wider group. Coverage obtained on this basis was 77% of revenue (2021: 82%) and 73% of insurance debtors. Of the group’s 24 significant components, 7 were subjected to full scope audits of the financial information of the component and 17 subjected to an audit of one or more account balances, classes of transactions or disclosures. Audits were performed at levels of materiality lower than group materiality with a range of £2.2m to £3.0m. Those subjected to an audit of one or more account balances, classes of transactions or disclosures are not individually financially significant enough to require full scope audit of the financial information of the component for group purposes, but did present specific areas of risk which needed to be addressed. At the group level we also tested the consolidation process and carried out analytical procedures to confirm our conclusion that there were no significant risks of material misstatement of the aggregated financial information of the remaining components not subject to a full audit. ----- ###### INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF ARDONAGH MIDCO 2 PLC Report on the audit of the financial statements 7.2 Our consideration of the control environment We obtained an understanding of the control environment, including the significant underlying IT systems. We planned not to rely on the general IT controls or application controls, as the group is still growing quickly and has a developing control environment. We obtained an understanding of the relevant controls relating to the financial reporting environment and the major revenue streams. 7.3 Our consideration of climate-related risks As part of the audit, we made enquiries of management to understand the process they have adopted to assess the potential impact of climate change on the financial statements. Management considers that the impact of climate change does not give rise to a material financial statement impact. We used our knowledge of the Group to evaluate management’s assessment. We also considered the consistency of the disclosures in relation to climate change made in the other information within the annual report with the financial statements and our knowledge from our audit. 7.4 Working with other auditors Work on Arachas Corporate Brokers (Ireland) was subject to a full scope audit and Glennon (Ireland), Resilium (Australia), MDS (Brazil) and MDS (Portugal) were subject to specified audit procedures. This was undertaken by Deloitte overseas component audit teams. We directed and supervised the component teams in the performance of their work through providing detailed instructions setting out the work to be performed, having regular conference calls with the team throughout the audit and by performing a review of their audit working papers over a video conference. ###### 8 Other information The other information comprises the information included in the annual report, other than the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information contained within the annual report. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether this gives rise to a material misstatement in the financial statements themselves. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. ----- ###### INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF ARDONAGH MIDCO 2 PLC Report on the audit of the financial statements 9 Responsibilities of directors As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group’s and the parent company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so. ###### 10 Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the FRC’s [website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor’s report.](http://www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities) ###### 11 Extent to which the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below. 11.1 Identifying and assessing potential risks related to irregularities In identifying and assessing risks of material misstatement in respect of irregularities, including fraud and non-compliance with laws and regulations, we considered the following: - the nature of the industry and sector, control environment and business performance including the design of the group’s remuneration policies, key drivers for directors’ remuneration, bonus levels and performance targets; - results of our enquiries of management and the audit committee about their own identification and assessment of the risks of irregularities; ----- ###### INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF ARDONAGH MIDCO 2 PLC Report on the audit of the financial statements - any matters we identified having obtained and reviewed the group’s documentation of their policies and procedures relating to: `o` identifying, evaluating and complying with laws and regulations and whether they were aware of any instances of non-compliance; `o` detecting and responding to the risks of fraud and whether they have knowledge of any actual, suspected or alleged fraud; `o` the internal controls established to mitigate risks of fraud or non-compliance with laws and regulations; - the matters discussed among the audit engagement team including significant component audit teams and relevant internal specialists, including tax, valuations, IT, and industry specialists regarding how and where fraud might occur in the financial statements and any potential indicators of fraud. As a result of these procedures, we considered the opportunities and incentives that may exist within the organisation for fraud and identified the greatest potential for fraud in the following areas: goodwill impairment, acquisition accounting under IFRS 3 business combinations – Ed Broking Group Limited, Besso Insurance Group Limited, presentation of alternative performance measures and revenue recognition – cut off in Specialty division. In common with all audits under ISAs (UK), we are also required to perform specific procedures to respond to the risk of management override. We also obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory framework that the group operates in, focusing on provisions of those laws and regulations that had a direct effect on the determination of material amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The key laws and regulations we considered in this context included the UK Companies Act. In addition, we considered provisions of other laws and regulations that do not have a direct effect on the financial statements but compliance with which may be fundamental to the group’s ability to operate or to avoid a material penalty. These included the group’s FCA permissions and compliance with FCA client assets regulations. 11.2 Audit response to risks identified As a result of performing the above, we identified acquisition accounting under IFRS 3 business combinations – Ed Broking Group Limited, Besso Insurance Group Limited, presentation of alternative performance measures, and goodwill impairment as key audit matters related to the potential risk of fraud. The key audit matters section of our report explains the matters in more detail and also describes the specific procedures we performed in response to those key audit matters. ----- ###### INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF ARDONAGH MIDCO 2 PLC Report on the audit of the financial statements In addition to the above, our procedures to respond to risks identified included the following: - reviewing the financial statement disclosures and testing to supporting documentation to assess compliance with provisions of relevant laws and regulations described as having a direct effect on the financial statements; - enquiring of management, the audit committee and in-house legal counsel concerning actual and potential litigation and claims; - performing analytical procedures to identify any unusual or unexpected relationships that may indicate risks of material misstatement due to fraud; - reading minutes of meetings of those charged with governance, reviewing internal audit reports and reviewing correspondence with the FCA; - in relation to the cut off risk in Specialty division revenue: we analysed the divisional vs budget performance throughout the year, comparing to market expectations to identify any significant differences on the basis of known rate inflation across the market. We also obtained the December 2022 and January 2023 revenue listings and assessed whether revenue was correctly being recognised in each period. - in addressing the risk of fraud through management override of controls, testing the appropriateness of journal entries and other adjustments; assessing whether the judgements made in making accounting estimates are indicative of a potential bias; and evaluating the business rationale of any significant transactions that are unusual or outside the normal course of business.

1923_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,100,NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,100.1,2** **Basis of preparation (continued),100.1.1,,"Key stress scenarios that the Directors have considered include cumulative stresses to the base plan as a result of: - Shortfalls in base case projected income throughout 2023 and 2024. - Deterioration in base case cash conversion rates over and above the shortfalls in income. - An inflationary cost increase of 2% over the base case assumptions. - Additional interest costs on the term and CAR debt facilities based on forward interest rate expectations. - Mitigating actions within management control including delayed capital expenditure, a reduction in discretionary spend and measured reductions in employee headcount and remuneration. The Directors have also modelled reverse stress scenarios, including assessing those that result in a default on the Group’s term debt facilities that would require a technical repayment obligation and those that would exhaust available liquidity. The stresses needed for these outcomes to happen significantly exceed the key stress scenarios above and the Directors consider such conditions to be a remote possibility. Other mitigations which may be possible in the stress scenarios but have not been included in the analysis include seeking shareholder support, securitising premium receivables and further incremental and more prolonged cost reductions. The Directors continue to consider the wider operational and financial consequences and ramifications of global political and economic tensions (including related to the Ukrainian conflict, foreign exchange rates, inflation and increasing interest rates). In particular: - Insurance broking is a resilient and defensive market, which has historically had limited impact from past economic or capital market downturns. The Group is highly diversified and not unduly exposed to a single carrier, customer or market sector. - Although economic developments remain fluid, the stress testing demonstrates the Group’s financial resilience and operating flexibility. - As a result of Russia invading Ukraine, we have seen significant new sanctions legislation from a range of legislators (including the US, EU and UK), with newly sanctioned entities and individuals, and new (or wider in scope) sectoral sanctions targeting Russia (and Belarus). The Ardonagh Group has no appetite for potential breaches of applicable sanctions regimes and applies appropriate controls including automated screening of clients against relevant sanctions lists. We continue to actively monitor the situation as it develops and will respond accordingly as new sanctions are enacted. - The Group continues to monitor the risk of cyber-attacks, but the Group has not identified any significant security risks during the period ended 31 December 2022. Following the assessment of the Group’s financial position and its ability to meet its obligations as and when they fall due, including the further potential financial implications of economic uncertainty included in stress tests, the Directors are not aware of any material uncertainties that cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. ----- ###### FINANCIAL STATEMENTS",N/A,as_expected,2024,879

1923_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,100,NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,100.3,(a) Basis of consolidation,100.3.1,,"The Group consolidates those investees that it is deemed to control, referred to as subsidiaries. The Group has control over an investee if all three of the following are met: (i) it has power over the investee, (ii) it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the investee, and (iii) it has ability to use its power over the investee to affect the amount of its own returns. The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether the Group controls another entity. Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. The assets, liabilities, profits and losses of the subsidiary are added line by line to those of the Group. Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains and losses on transactions between Group companies are eliminated. Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group. Accounting for business combinations The Group uses the acquisition method of accounting to account for business combinations. The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair value of the assets transferred, the liabilities assumed, and the equity interests issued by the Group. The consideration transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement. Identifiable assets acquired, and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed, in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. The Group does not recognise a contingent asset at the acquisition date. The Group recognises any non-controlling interest in the acquiree at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the acquiree’s net assets. Acquisition-related costs, except costs to issue debt or equity securities, are expensed as incurred. If a business combination is achieved in stages, the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree is re-measured to fair value at the acquisition date through profit or loss. Some acquisitions involve a put and/or call option. A put option gives the seller the right to require the Group to acquire its shareholdings in the acquiree at a future date. A call option gives the Group the right to require the seller to sell its shareholdings in the acquiree to the Group. The put and/or call options are usually exercisable within specified time periods. The exercise price of the options is usually based on a multiple of EBITDA, net of the net debt of the acquiree for the financial year that immediately precedes the financial year in which the option is exercised. The Group recognises a financial liability where there is a put option, at an amount corresponding to the present value of the option price (the redemption amount), and that liability is classified as ‘Share buyout’ in the financial statements. Subsequent changes to the fair value of deferred consideration, contingent consideration or the share buyout balance are recognised in accordance with IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ in profit or loss, unless the changes occur during the ‘measurement period’ of up to one year following the acquisition date and are the result of additional information that the acquirer has obtained after the acquisition date about facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date. Contingent consideration that is classified as equity is not re-measured, and its subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity. ----- ###### FINANCIAL STATEMENTS",N/A,as_expected,2024,879
1923_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,100,NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,100.4,NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 3** **Accounting policies (continued),100.4.1,,"Disposal of subsidiaries Where the Group disposes of its controlling interest in a subsidiary, the assets and liabilities are derecognised along with any related non-controlling interest and other components of equity. Any resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss. Any interest retained in the former subsidiary is measured at fair value when control is lost. Goodwill Goodwill is initially measured as the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred and of the non-controlling interest over the fair value of the net of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If goodwill is negative (i.e. a shortfall instead of an excess), it is recognised in profit or loss. Goodwill acquired in the period represents expected synergies from combining operations of the acquiree and the Group, and intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment and is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold. Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units for the purposes of impairment testing. Transactions with non-controlling interests Transactions with non-controlling interests that do not result in the loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions. Intellectual property Intellectual property assets include a bespoke database and online platform. These assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life of 4 years. Derecognition of intangible assets An intangible asset is derecognised on disposal, or when no future economic benefits are expected from use or disposal. Gains or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset, measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset, are recognised in profit or loss when the asset is derecognised. Impairment of assets Intangible assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment. Assets that are subject to amortisation or depreciation are reviewed for impairment at each statement of financial position date or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. If it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the recoverable amount of the ‘cash generating unit’ to which the asset belongs is determined, being the lowest level for which there are separately identifiable cash flows. Any impairment charges arising from the review of the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets are, where material, disclosed separately on the face of the consolidated income statement. Financial assets classified as amortised cost Financial assets that meet the following conditions are classified and subsequently measured at amortised cost: - the financial asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows; and - the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. The amortised cost of a financial asset is the amount at which the financial asset is measured at initial recognition minus the principal repayments, plus the cumulative amortisation using the effective interest method of any difference between that initial amount and the maturity amount, adjusted for any loss allowance. The Group’s financial assets measured at amortised cost include trade and other receivables (except for certain other receivables measured at FVTPL, see below), advances to related parties, cash and cash equivalents and certain other financial assets. The Group’s trade receivables do not generally have a significant financing component, so their transaction (invoiced) price is considered to be their amortised cost. Insurance brokers act as agents in placing the insurable risks of their clients with insurers and, as such, are not usually liable as principal for amounts arising from such transactions. In recognition of this relationship, debtors from insurance broking transactions are not, in general, included as an asset of the Group. Other than the receivable for fees and commissions earned on a transaction, recognition of the insurance transaction does not, in general, occur until the Group receives cash in respect of premiums or claims, at which time a corresponding liability is established in favour of the insurer or the client. An exception exists in relation to funded premium and claim items whereby the Group has a legal obligation to make good any shortfall to client monies in the event of default. In certain circumstances, the Group advances premiums, refunds or claims to insurers or clients prior to collection. These advances are reflected in the consolidated statement of financial position as part of trade receivables. Financial assets classified as FVTOCI Financial assets are classified and subsequently measured at FVTOCI if they meet the criteria to be classified at amortised cost except that the business model is to sell financial assets as well as to hold financial assets to collect contractual cash flows. The Group may also irrevocably elect to classify and subsequently measure equity investments at FVTOCI. Gains and losses on these equity instruments are never recycled to profit or loss. Dividend income from equity instruments measured at FVTOCI is recognised in profit or loss as part of investment income when the right to payment has been established (provided that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and that the amount of income can be measured reliably), except when the Group benefits from such proceeds as a recovery of part of the cost of the instrument, in which case, such gains are recorded in other comprehensive income. The right to payment is established on the ex-dividend date for listed equity securities, and usually on the date when shareholders approve the dividend for unlisted equity securities. Equity instruments at FVTOCI are not subject to an impairment assessment. The Group has designated all of its unlisted equity investments as at FVTOCI, because these investments were on initial recognition held as long-term strategic investments that are not expected to be sold in the short to medium term. ----- ###### FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Financial assets classified as FVTPL Financial assets that do not meet the criteria for being measured at amortised cost or FVTOCI are measured at FVTPL. Specifically: - Investments in equity instruments are classified as FVTPL, unless the Group designates an equity investment as FVTOCI on initial recognition. - Debt instruments (including receivables) that do not meet the amortised cost criteria or the FVTOCI criteria are classified as FVTPL. Financial assets classified as FVTPL are recorded in the statement of financial position at fair value. Changes in fair value are recorded in profit and loss to the extent they are not part of a designated hedging relationship. The Group has not designated any debt investments that meet the amortised cost or FVTOCI criteria as being measured at FVTPL. Other financial assets measured at FVTPL include convertible loan receivables, and receivables recognised on a business combination in relation to the Group’s right to variable consideration on rolling contracts with customers for which the performance obligation was satisfied prior to the acquisition. These financial assets are not classified as amortised cost or FVTOCI because their cash flows do not represent solely payments of principal and interest. Foreign exchange gains and losses The carrying amount of financial assets that are denominated in a foreign currency is determined in that foreign currency and translated at the spot rate at the end of each reporting period. Specifically: - for equity instruments measured at FVTOCI, exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income; and - for all other financial assets that are not part of a designated hedging relationship, exchange differences are recognised in profit or loss in the other operating costs line item. Reclassifications Financial assets are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition. They would only be reclassified if the Group were to change its business model for managing its financial assets, in which case the affected financial assets would be reclassified following that change. Impairment of financial assets The Group assesses, on a forward-looking basis, the expected credit losses (ECL) associated with its financial assets carried at amortised cost. The Group recognises a loss allowance for such losses at each reporting date. The Group recognises lifetime ECL for trade and other receivables. The expected credit losses on these financial assets are estimated using a provision matrix based on the Group’s historical credit loss experience, adjusted for factors that are specific to the debtors and by scalar factors to reflect differences between economic conditions during the period over which the historical data was collected versus current conditions and the Group’s view of economic conditions over the expected lives of the receivables, including the time value of money where appropriate. Scalar factors are typically based on GDP and unemployment rate forecasts. For all other financial instruments, the Group recognises lifetime ECL when there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition. If, on the other hand, the credit risk on the financial instrument has not increased significantly since initial recognition, the Group measures the loss allowance for that financial instrument at an amount equal to 12 months ECL. ----- ###### FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The Group assumes that the credit risk on a financial instrument has not increased significantly since initial recognition if the financial instrument is determined to have low credit risk at the reporting date. A financial instrument is determined to have low credit risk if (i) the financial instrument has a low risk of default, (ii) the borrower has a strong capacity to meet its contractual cash flow obligations in the near term, and (iii) adverse changes in economic and business conditions in the longer term may, but will not necessarily, reduce the ability of the borrower to fulfil its contractual cash flow obligations. All cash and cash equivalents are assessed to have low credit risk at each reporting date as they are held with reputable banks and financial institution counterparties with, wherever possible, a minimum single A credit rating from both Moody’s and S&P. The Group measures the loss allowance for such assets at an amount equal to 12 months ECL. ECL is estimated as the difference between all contractual cash flows that are due to the Group in accordance with the contract and all the cash flows that the Group expects to receive, discounted at the original effective interest rate. Lifetime ECL represents the expected credit losses that will result from all possible default events over the expected life of a financial instrument. 12 months ECL represents the portion of lifetime ECL that is expected to result from default events on a financial instrument that are possible within 12 months after the reporting date. Lifetime ECL is measured on a collective basis to cater for cases where evidence of significant increases in credit risk at the individual instrument level may not yet be available. Definition of default The Group considers the following as constituting an event of default for internal credit risk management purposes as historical experience indicates that receivables that meet either of the following criteria are generally not recoverable: - when there is a breach of financial covenants by the counterparty; or - information developed internally or obtained from external sources indicates that the debtor is unlikely to pay its creditors, including the Group, in full. Irrespective of the above analysis, the Group considers that default has occurred when a financial asset is more than 90 days past due unless the Group has reasonable and supportable information to demonstrate that a longer or shorter default criterion is more appropriate. Credit-impaired financial assets A financial asset is credit-impaired when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of that financial asset have occurred. Evidence that a financial asset is credit-impaired includes observable data about the following events: - significant financial difficulty of the counterparty; - a breach of contract, such as a default or past due event; - the lender(s) of the counterparty, for economic or contractual reasons relating to the counterparty’s financial difficulty, having granted to the counterparty a concession that the lender(s) would not otherwise consider; - it is becoming probable that the counterparty will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation; or - the disappearance of an active market for that financial asset because of the financial difficulties. Write-off policy The Group writes off a trade receivable when there is information indicating that the debtor is in severe financial difficulty and there is no realistic prospect of recovery, e.g. when the debtor has been placed under liquidation or has entered into bankruptcy proceedings, or when the trade receivables are over two years past due, whichever occurs earlier. A write-off constitutes a derecognition event. Financial assets written off may still be subject to enforcement activities under the Group’s recovery procedures, taking into account legal advice where appropriate. Any recoveries made are recognised in profit or loss. ----- ###### FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Classification and subsequent measurement of financial liabilities All financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method or at FVTPL. Financial liabilities are classified and measured as FVTPL when (i) the financial liability is deferred consideration, contingent consideration or a share buyout balance relating to a business combination to which IFRS 3 applies, or (ii) it is a derivative. Financial liabilities at FVTPL are stated at fair value with any gains or losses arising on changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss to the extent that they are not part of a designated hedging relationship. The net gain or loss recognised in profit or loss incorporates any interest paid on the financial liabilities. For financial liabilities that are denominated in a foreign currency that are not part of a designated hedging relationship, the foreign exchange gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss. The Group’s financial liabilities include borrowings, trade and other payables, derivatives, deferred consideration, contingent consideration and a share buyout balance. Borrowings Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the statement of financial position date. Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. They are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. Trade payables Trade payables are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost. Derivative financial instruments Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value at each reporting date. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss immediately unless the derivative is designated and effective as a hedging instrument, in which case the timing of the recognition in profit or loss depends on the nature of the hedge relationship. The fair values of various derivative financial instruments used for hedging purposes are disclosed in note 24 hedge accounting. Movements in the cash flow hedging reserve in shareholders’ equity are included in the consolidated statement of changes in equity. Deferred consideration, contingent consideration and share buyout balance The Group is party to consideration arrangements in the form of deferred consideration, contingent consideration and a share buyout balance. Deferred consideration represents fixed or determinable amounts payable at a specified date in the future. Contingent consideration is consideration that is contingent on a future event, usually the future performance of the acquired business. Share buyout arises as a result of put options held by minority shareholders of acquired businesses. These liabilities are recognised initially at their discounted present value and are remeasured at each reporting date. The discount unwind and the remeasurement of these liabilities are recognised in profit or loss as finance cost. ----- ###### FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Cash flow hedges The Group enters into forward contracts to manage its exposure to foreign exchange rate risks. The Group also enters into interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate risks. The Group designates these derivatives as cash flow hedges. Where the Group identifies foreign currency borrowings for which changes in foreign exchange rates offset the Group’s exposure to changes in cash flows associated with highly probable forecast transactions, such as forecast revenue denominated in that foreign currency, the Group also designates such borrowings as cash flow hedges. In all cases these are hedges of a particular risk associated with the cash flows of highly probable forecast transactions. At the inception of such hedging transactions the Group documents whether the hedging instrument is effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, which is when the hedging relationships meet all of the following hedge effectiveness requirements: - there is an economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument; - the effect of credit risk does not dominate the value changes that result from that economic relationship; and - the hedge ratio of the hedging relationship is the same as that resulting from the quantity of the hedged item that the Group actually hedges and the quantity of the hedging instrument that the entity actually uses to hedge that quantity of hedged item. If a hedging relationship ceases to meet the hedge effectiveness requirement relating to the hedge ratio but the risk management objective for that designated hedging relationship remains the same, the Group adjusts the hedge ratio of the hedging relationship (i.e. rebalances the hedge) so that it meets the qualifying criteria again. When a derivative or other financial instrument is designated as a cash flow hedging instrument, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of such instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated under the heading of cash flow hedging reserve. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of the instrument that is recognised in other comprehensive income is limited to the cumulative change in fair value of the hedged item, determined on a present value basis, from inception of the hedge. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in profit or loss and is included in finance costs for the derivatives that hedge borrowings and in other operating costs for the instruments that hedge revenue. Amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity are reclassified to profit or loss in the periods when the hedged item affects profit or loss, included in the same line as that which the hedged item affects. Furthermore, if the Group expects that some or all of the loss accumulated in other comprehensive income will not be recovered in the future, that amount is immediately reclassified to profit or loss. The Group discontinues hedge accounting only when the hedging relationship (or a part thereof) ceases to meet the qualifying criteria (after rebalancing, if applicable). This includes instances when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised. The discontinuation is accounted for prospectively. Any gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity at that time remains in equity and is reclassified to profit or loss when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in profit or loss. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the gain or loss accumulated in equity is recognised immediately in profit or loss. ----- ###### FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Derivatives hedging borrowings The Group’s risk management policy is to hedge against adverse fluctuations in interest rates by reducing its exposure to variability in cash flows on the Group’s floating-rate borrowings to the extent that it is practicable and cost effective to do so. Interest rate risk exposures are hedged by the Group using interest rate swap derivatives to offset the variability associated with the variable rates on its floating-rate borrowings. The Group uses the hypothetical derivative method to determine the changes in fair value of the hedged item. The Group assesses hedge effectiveness by comparing the changes in fair value of a hypothetical derivative reflecting the terms of the floating rate borrowing with the changes in fair value of the derivatives used to hedge the exposure. The Group determines the hedge ratio by comparing the notional of the derivatives with the principal of the designated portion of the borrowing. The Group has identified the following possible sources of ineffectiveness in these cash flow hedge relationships: - The variable interest rate of the swap is not subject to a floor, and the borrowing from which the hedged items are expected to flow are subject to a floor of 0.75%. Should the floor have an intrinsic value, this would trigger ineffectiveness going forward. - The effect of the counterparty and the Group’s own credit risk on the fair value of the interest rate swap, which is not reflected in the change in the fair value of the hedged items; and - The possibility of changes to the critical terms of the hedged items due to a refinancing or debt renegotiation such that they no longer match those of the interest rate swap. Derivatives hedging revenue The Group’s policy is for the critical terms of the forward contracts to align with the hedged item. The Group determines the existence of an economic relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item based on the currency, amount and timing of their respective cash flows. The Group assesses whether the instrument designated in each hedging relationship is expected to be and has been effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged item using the hypothetical derivative method. In these hedge relationships, the main sources of ineffectiveness are: - The effect of the counterparty and the Group’s own credit risk on the fair value of the forward contracts, which is not reflected in the change in the fair value of the hedged cash flows attributable to the change in exchange rates; - The use of different discounting curves for the hedged item and the hedging instrument, because for the derivatives the discounting curve used depends on collateralisation and the type of collateral used; and - Changes in the timing of the hedged transactions. For the forward contracts hedging revenue, the Group designates the entire hedging instrument (i.e. the currency forward inclusive of the forward element). Given the size of the notional, tenure and currency pairs involved in the currency forwards, the forward points are not considered to be significant enough to warrant separation as costs of hedging and so are included in the measurement of the hedged item. ----- ###### FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Finance income and finance costs The Group’s finance income and finance costs include: - Interest income - Interest expense - Interest on defined benefit pension schemes - Unwind of discount on provisions - Unwind of discount on financial assets or liabilities, including on lease liabilities and lease receivables - Unwind of discount and fair value remeasurement of deferred consideration, contingent consideration and the share buyout balance - The net gain or loss reclassified from other comprehensive income to profit or loss in relation to derivatives hedging borrowings - Gains and losses on convertible loan receivables Interest income and expense are recognised using the effective interest method for debt instruments classified as amortised cost and as FVTOCI. Post-placement performance obligations The Group may also have post-placement obligations in contracts with customers, which mainly consist of claims services associated with the claims life cycle, e.g. first notification, claims investigation, decision and settlement, supply chain management, fraud investigation, field/loss adjusting services and management information, but which may also include other performance obligations such as the provision of mid-term adjustments. To the extent that commission and fees received (or receivable) relate to both placement and post-placement performance obligations, a suitable proportion of income related to post-placement obligations is deferred based on the estimated standalone selling prices of the performance obligations in the contract and is presented as a contract liability. Revenue for post-placement obligations is recognised over the period of providing the services. Variable consideration The Group is a party to the following material arrangements where the consideration receivable by the Group is variable: - Trading deals – profit share arrangements and loss corridor arrangements: Trading deals are arrangements with insurers which include incentives and penalties based on the performance of the book of business. Revenue related to these arrangements is recognised on a best estimate basis, only to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognised will not occur (a constraint). Under some of these arrangements (e.g. profit share arrangements), an additional commission is earned from the insurer based on the profit from the underlying book of business or the volume of policies placed. The estimated additional commission is recognised as a contract asset and is reclassified to trade and other receivables when the underlying results are determined. Some of the additional commissions may be provided in advance, in which case they can be subject to a clawback. Advanced commission is recognised as a contract liability until the Group satisfies the underlying performance obligations. Under loss corridor arrangements, the commission received by the Group is subject to a clawback if a set loss ratio exceeds an agreed threshold. When the threshold is exceeded, a payment calculated as a percentage of the loss (between 1% and 4% of the loss) is due to the insurer up to a maximum. Expected clawbacks under loss corridor arrangements are recognised in trade and other payables. Payment terms of the above arrangements vary across the Group and depend on the specific agreement with the insurer. Because of the time required for policies to earn out and for claims to mature, final settlement of profit share and loss corridor arrangements may take up to 2-3 years from the point at which the Group places a policy (i.e. satisfies its performance obligation). - Cancellation rights: Some contracts with customers include cancellation rights, whereby the consideration receivable by the Group is subject to a clawback. If no claims are made under the policy, then cancellations usually entitle the policyholder to a proportional refund of the consideration. When the effect is material, the Group adjusts the estimated consideration for the expected clawback based on historical experience of average cancellations and recognises revenue only on the amount that is not expected to be refunded. The Group reassesses at the end of the reporting period whether the estimated clawback needs to be revisited. Amounts that are expected to be refunded for consideration that has been received or invoiced are recognised in trade and other payables. - Rolling contracts: Some policies placed by the Group are rolling until the customer cancels the policy. Revenue recognised on rolling contracts (based on the expected consideration net of cancellations) is presented in contract assets until the consideration is invoiced (except where acquired as part of a business combination, in which case it is presented in trade and other receivables as a financial asset measured at fair value). ----- ###### FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Other income Other income includes; - Fair value gains and losses on financial assets at FVTPL that are recognised on a business combination in relation to the Group’s right to variable consideration on rolling contracts with customers for which the performance obligation was satisfied prior to the acquisition. - Rent receivable and service charges receivable in respect of sub-let properties. - Profit on termination of leases. Long-Term Incentive Plans The Group operates a number of Long-Term Incentive Plans (LTIPs), under which the Group receives services from employees as consideration for cash settled incentives which vest over a number of years based on achievement against certain performance measures and/or service conditions. The incentives are earned by participants in the relevant performance and/or service period (the performance period) and they must remain in employment in order to be entitled to payment. The Group recognises an expense in respect of LTIPs over the vesting period, which is deemed to commence when the Group makes participants aware of their right to participate in the LTIP and ends on conclusion of the performance period. Where an LTIP is payable in instalments the Group recognises an expense based on either (i) the staged vesting approach, or (ii) the plan’s benefit formula, depending on the specific facts and circumstances of the relevant award. Where benefits are materially higher in later years the expense is recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. At the end of each reporting period the Group revises its estimate of the expected pay-out, and it recognises the impact of the revision to the original estimate, if any, in the income statement with a corresponding adjustment to the related accrual or prepayment (there can be a prepayment if an interim payment has been made subject to a clawback period) as relevant. Defined benefit pension arrangements The Group has defined benefit arrangements. The cost of providing benefits for these schemes is determined using the projected unit credit method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at the end of each annual reporting period. Remeasurements comprising actuarial gains and losses, and the return on plan assets (excluding interest income), including the tax thereon, are recognised immediately in the statement of financial position with a charge or credit to other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur. Remeasurements recognised in other comprehensive income are not reclassified. Current service costs are recognised in profit or loss within salaries and associated expenses, as are any past service costs such as those arising from curtailments or settlements. Gains or losses on settlement of a defined benefit plan are recognised when the settlement occurs. Interest is calculated by applying a discount rate to the net defined benefit liability or asset and is recognised within finance costs (note 7). Defined benefit costs are split into three categories: - Service costs, which includes current service cost and past service cost; and - Interest on the pension obligation; and - Remeasurement of net pension obligation, which includes: - The impact on the liabilities of changes in financial assumptions, which are based on market conditions at the reporting date, and demographic assumptions, such as life expectancy, compared with those adopted at the start of the period; and - The impact on the liabilities of actual experience being different to assumptions made at the start of the period; and - The return on plan assets above or below the interest income on those plan assets. The net pension obligation (or pension surplus) recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position represents the deficit (or surplus) in a defined benefit plan. Any surplus is limited to the present value of any economic benefits available in the form of refunds from the plans or reductions in future contributions to the plans. ----- ###### FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Share-based payments The Group operates equity-settled and cash-settled share-based payment schemes. For equity-settled share-based payment schemes, the fair value of the services received in exchange for the grant of the shares is recognised as an expense, measured based on the grant date fair value of the shares and recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, which generally depends on service and performance conditions being met. For cash-settled share-based payment schemes, the Group recognises an expense and a corresponding liability over the vesting period based on the fair value of the shares at the reporting date. The shares issued under the schemes generally have no dividend or voting rights and cannot be sold. The shares of an equitysettled share-based payment scheme are normally convertible to ordinary shares of the Group on the occurrence of a crystallisation event, being the earlier of a liquidity event, an Initial Public Offering (IPO) and a winding-up. The Group has the option to repurchase the shares if an employee leaves the Group prior to the occurrence of a crystallisation event. The Group assumes that the credit risk on a financial instrument has not increased significantly since initial recognition if the financial instrument is determined to have low credit risk at the reporting date. A financial instrument is determined to have low credit risk if (i) the financial instrument has a low risk of default, (ii) the borrower has a strong capacity to meet its contractual cash flow obligations in the near term, and (iii) adverse changes in economic and business conditions in the longer term may, but will not necessarily, reduce the ability of the borrower to fulfil its contractual cash flow obligations. All cash and cash equivalents are assessed to have low credit risk at each reporting date as they are held with reputable banks and financial institution counterparties with, wherever possible, a minimum single A credit rating from both Moody's and S&P. The Group measures the loss allowance for such assets at an amount equal to 12 months ECL. ECL is estimated as the difference between all contractual cash flows that are due to the Group in accordance with the contract and all the cash flows that the Group expects to receive, discounted at the original effective interest rate. Lifetime ECL represents the expected credit losses that will result from all possible default events over the expected life of a financial instrument. 12 months ECL represents the portion of lifetime ECL that is expected to result from default events on a financial instrument that are possible within 12 months after the reporting date. Lifetime ECL is measured on a collective basis to cater for cases where evidence of significant increases in credit risk at the individual instrument level may not yet be available. Definition of default The Group considers the following as constituting an event of default for internal credit risk management purposes as historical experience indicates that receivables that meet either of the following criteria are generally not recoverable: - when there is a breach of financial covenants by the counterparty; or - information developed internally or obtained from external sources indicates that the debtor is unlikely to pay its creditors, including the Group, in full. Irrespective of the above analysis, the Group considers that default has occurred when a financial asset is more than 90 days past due unless the Group has reasonable and supportable information to demonstrate that a longer or shorter default criterion is more appropriate. Credit-impaired financial assets A financial asset is credit-impaired when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of that financial asset have occurred. Evidence that a financial asset is credit-impaired includes observable data about the following events: - significant financial difficulty of the counterparty; - a breach of contract, such as a default or past due event; - the lender(s) of the counterparty, for economic or contractual reasons relating to the counterparty's financial difficulty, having granted to the counterparty a concession that the lender(s) would not otherwise consider; - it is becoming probable that the counterparty will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation; or - the disappearance of an active market for that financial asset because of the financial difficulties. Write-off policy The Group writes off a trade receivable when there is information indicating that the debtor is in severe financial difficulty and there is no realistic prospect of recovery, e.g. when the debtor has been placed under liquidation or has entered into bankruptcy proceedings, or when the trade receivables are over two years past due, whichever occurs earlier. A write-off constitutes a derecognition event. Financial assets written **_off may still be subject to enforcement activities under the Group's recovery procedures, taking into account legal advice where appropriate. Any recoveries made are recognised in profit or loss. ----- ###### FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Classification and subsequent measurement of financial liabilities All financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method or at FVTPL. Financial liabilities are classified and measured as FVTPL when (i) the financial liability is deferred consideration, contingent consideration or a share buyout balance relating to a business combination to which IFRS 3 applies, or (ii) it is a derivative. Financial liabilities at FVTPL are stated at fair value with any gains or losses arising on changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss to the extent that they are not part of a designated hedging relationship. The net gain or loss recognised in profit or loss incorporates any interest paid on the financial liabilities. For financial liabilities that are denominated in a foreign currency that are not part of a designated hedging relationship, the foreign exchange gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss. The Group's financial liabilities include borrowings, trade and other payables, derivatives, deferred consideration, contingent consideration and a share buyout balance. _Borrowings_ Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the statement of financial position date. Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. They are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. _Trade payables_ Trade payables are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost. Derivative financial instruments Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value at each reporting date. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss immediately unless the derivative is designated and effective as a hedging instrument, in which case the timing of the recognition in profit or loss depends on the nature of the hedge relationship. The fair values of various derivative financial instruments used for hedging purposes are disclosed in note 26 hedge accounting. Movements in the cash flow hedging reserve in shareholders' equity are included in the consolidated statement of changes in equity. Deferred .consideration contingent consideration and share buyout balance The Group is party to consideration arrangements in the form of deferred consideration, contingent consideration and a share buyout balance. Deferred consideration represents fixed or determinable amounts payable at a specified date in the future. Contingent consideration is consideration that is contingent on a future event, usually the future performance of the acquired business. Share buyout arises as a result of put options held by minority shareholders of acquired businesses. These liabilities are recognised initially at their discounted present value and are remeasured at each reporting date. The discount unwind and the remeasurement of these liabilities are recognised in profit or loss as finance cost. ----- ###### FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Cash flow hedges The Group enters into forward contracts to manage its exposure to foreign exchange rate risks. The Group also enters into interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate risks. The Group designates these derivatives as cash flow hedges, being hedges of a particular risk associated with the cash flows of recognised liabilities and highly probable forecast transactions. At the inception of such hedging transactions the Group documents whether the hedging instrument is effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, which is when the hedging relationships meet all of the following hedge effectiveness requirements: - there is an economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument; - the effect of credit risk does not dominate the value changes that result from that economic relationship; and - the hedge ratio of the hedging relationship is the same as that resulting from the quantity of the hedged item that the Group actually hedges and the quantity of the hedging instrument that the entity actually uses to hedge that quantity of hedged item. If a hedging relationship ceases to meet the hedge effectiveness requirement relating to the hedge ratio but the risk management objective for that designated hedging relationship remains the same, the Group adjusts the hedge ratio of the hedging relationship (i.e. rebalances the hedge) so that it meets the qualifying criteria again. When a derivative is designated as a cash flow hedging instrument, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated under the heading of cash flow hedging reserve. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative that is recognised in other comprehensive income is limited to the cumulative change in fair value of the hedged item, determined on a present value basis, from inception of the hedge. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in profit or loss and is included in finance costs for the derivatives that hedge borrowings and in other operating costs for the derivatives that hedge revenue. Amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity are reclassified to profit or loss in the periods when the hedged item affects profit or loss, included in the same line as that which the hedged item affects. Furthermore, if the Group expects that some or all of the loss accumulated in other comprehensive income will not be recovered in the future, that amount is immediately reclassified to profit or loss. The Group discontinues hedge accounting only when the hedging relationship (or a part thereof) ceases to meet the qualifying criteria (after rebalancing, if applicable). This includes instances when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised. The discontinuation is accounted for prospectively. Any gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity at that time remains in equity and is reclassified to profit or loss when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in profit or loss. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the gain or loss accumulated in equity is recognised immediately in profit or loss. ----- ###### FINANCIAL STATEMENTS _Derivatives hedging borrowings_ The Group's risk management policy is to hedge its foreign currency exposure to its USO denominated borrowings, where there is no offsetting foreign currency exposure from its investments funded by those borrowings. For the cross currency swaps (before they were all settled in 2020) and the forward contracts hedging borrowings, the Group separates the foreign currency basis spread and forward points from the derivative and excludes it from the designation of that financial instrument as the hedging instrument. The fair value changes in the currency basis spread and forward points are separately accounted for as a cost of hedging in other comprehensive income and recognised in the costs of hedging reserve within equity. Such costs of hedging are amortised (i.e. reclassified to profit or loss) over the life of the hedged borrowings (or when the hedge is de-designated). The treatment for the currency basis element and forward points is optional and the option is applied on a hedge by hedge basis. The Group uses the hypothetical derivative method to determine the changes in fair value of the hedged item. The Group assesses hedge effectiveness by comparing the changes in fair value of a hypothetical derivative reflecting the terms of the foreign currency debt security issued due to movements in the foreign currency rate with the changes in fair value of the derivatives used to hedge the exposure. The Group determines the hedge ratio by comparing the notional of the derivatives with the principal of the debt securities issued. The Group has identified the following possible sources of ineffectiveness in these cash flow hedge relationships: - The use of cross currency derivatives and forward contracts as a protection against currency risk creates an exposure to the derivative counterparty's credit risk which is not offset by the hedged item. This risk is minimised by entering into contracts with high credit quality counterparties; - The use of different discounting curves for the hedged item and the hedging instrument, because for the derivatives the discounting curve used depends on collateralisation and the type of collateral used; and - Designation of off-market hedging instruments. No other sources of ineffectiveness affected these hedge relationships. The Group has not designated any net positions as hedged items on cash flow hedges of foreign currency risk. _Derivatives hedging revenue_ The Group's risk management policy is to hedge 80%, 65% and 50% of its estimated foreign currency exposure in respect of forecast revenue (except where offset by foreign currency costs) over the following 12, 24 and 36 months respectively. Hedges mature monthly and new hedges are added on a rolling quarterly basis. The Group's policy is for the critical terms of the forward contracts to align with the hedged item. The Group determines the existence of an economic relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item based on the currency, amount and timing of their respective cash flows. The Group assesses whether the derivative designated in each hedging relationship is expected to be and has been effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged item using the hypothetical derivative method. In these hedge relationships, the main sources of ineffectiveness are: - The effect of the counterparty and the Group's own credit risk on the fair value of the forward contracts, which is not reflected in the change in the fair value of the hedged cash flows attributable to the change in exchange rates; - The use of different discounting curves for the hedged item and the hedging instrument, because for the derivatives the discounting curve used depends on collateralisation and the type of collateral used; and - Changes in the timing of the hedged transactions. For the forward contracts hedging revenue, the Group designates the entire hedging instrument (i.e. the currency forward inclusive of the forward element). Given the size of the notional, tenure and currency pairs involved in the currency forwards, the forward points are not considered to be significant enough to warrant separation as costs of hedging and so are included in the measurement of the hedged item. ----- ###### FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Finance income and finance costs The Group's finance income and finance costs include: - Interest income - Interest expense e Interest on defined benefit pension schemes - Unwind of discount on provisions - Unwind of discount on financial assets or liabilities, including on lease liabilities and lease receivables - Unwind of discount and fair value remeasurement of deferred consideration, contingent consideration and the share buyout balance - The net gain or loss reclassified from other comprehensive income to profit or loss in relation to derivatives hedging borrowings - Gains and losses on convertible loan receivables Interest income and expense are recognised using the effective interest method for debt instruments classified as amortised cost and as FVTOCI. _Post-placement performance obligations_ The Group may also have post-placement obligations in contracts with customers, which mainly consist of claims services associated with the claims life cycle, e.g. first notification, claims investigation, decision and settlement, supply chain management, fraud investigation, field/loss adjusting services and management information, but which may also include other performance obligations such as the provision of mid-term adjustments. To the extent that commission and fees received (or receivable) relate to both placement and post-placement performance obligations, a suitable proportion of income related to post-placement obligations is deferred based on the estimated standalone selling prices of the performance obligations in the contract and is presented as a contract liability. Revenue for post-placement obligations is recognised over the period of providing the services. _Variable consideration_ The Group is a party to the following material arrangements where the consideration receivable by the Group is variable: - _Trading deals -_ _profit share arrangements and loss corridor arrangements: Trading deals are arrangements with insurers which include incentives and penalties based on the performance of the book of business. Revenue related to these arrangements is recognised on a best estimate basis, only to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognised will not occur (a constraint). Under some of these arrangements (e.g. profit share arrangements), an additional commission is earned from the insurer based on the profit from the underlying book of business or the volume of policies placed. The estimated additional commission is recognised as a contract asset and is reclassified to trade and other receivables when the underlying results are determined. Some of the additional commissions may be provided in advance, in which case they can be subject to a clawback. Advanced commission is recognised as a contract liability until the Group satisfies the underlying performance obligations. Under loss corridor arrangements, the commission received by the Group is subject to a clawback if a set loss ratio exceeds an agreed threshold. When the threshold is exceeded, a payment calculated as a percentage of the loss (between 1% and 4% of the loss) is due to the insurer up to a maximum. Expected clawbacks under loss corridor arrangements are recognised in trade and other payables. Payment terms of the above arrangements vary across the Group and depend on the specific agreement with the insurer. Because of the time required for policies to earn out and for claims to mature, final settlement of profit share and loss corridor arrangements may take up to 2-3 years from the point at which the Group places a policy (i.e. satisfies its performance obligation). - _Cancellation rights: Some contracts with customers include cancellation rights, whereby the consideration receivable by the Group is subject to a clawback. If no claims are made under the policy, then cancellations usually entitle the policyholder to a proportional refund of the consideration. When the effect is material, the Group adjusts the estimated consideration for the expected clawback based on historical experience of average cancellations and recognises revenue only on the amount that is not expected to be refunded. The Group reassesses at the end of the reporting period whether the estimated claw back needs to be revisited. Amounts that are expected to be refunded for consideration that has been received or invoiced are recognised in trade and other payables. - _Rolling contracts: Some policies placed by the Group are rolling until the customer cancels the policy. Revenue recognised on rolling contracts (based on the expected consideration net of cancellations) is presented in contract assets until the consideration is invoiced (except where acquired as part of a business combination, in which case it is presented in trade and other receivables as a financial asset measured at fair value). ----- ###### FINANCIAL STATEMENTS _Other income_ Other income includes; - Fair value gains and losses on financial assets at FVTPL that are recognised on a business combination in relation to the Group's right to variable consideration on rolling contracts with customers for which the performance obligation was satisfied prior to the acquisition. - Rent receivable and service charges receivable in respect of sub-let properties. - Profit on termination of leases. _Long-Term Incentive Plans_ The Group operates a number of Long-Term Incentive Plans (LTIPs), under which the Group receives services from employees as consideration for cash settled incentives which vest over a number of years based on achievement against certain performance measures and/or service conditions. The incentives are earned by participants in the relevant performance and/or service period (the performance period) and they must remain in employment in order to be entitled to payment. The Group recognises an expense in respect of LTIPs over the vesting period, which is deemed to commence when the Group makes participants aware of their right to participate in the LTIP and ends on conclusion of the performance period. Where an L TIP is payable in instalments the Group recognises an expense based on either (i) the staged vesting approach, or (ii) the plan's benefit formula, depending on the specific facts and circumstances of the relevant award. Where benefits are materially higher in later years the expense is recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. At the end of each reporting period the Group revises its estimate of the expected pay-out, and it recognises the impact of the revision to the original estimate, if any, in the income statement with a corresponding adjustment to the related accrual or prepayment (there can be a prepayment if an interim payment has been made subject to a clawback period) as relevant. _Defined benefit pension arrangements_ The Group has some defined benefit arrangements as a result of an acquisition made in 2021. The cost of providing benefits for these schemes is determined using the projected unit credit method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at the end of each annual reporting period. Remeasurements comprising actuarial gains and losses, and the return on plan assets (excluding interest income), including the tax thereon, are recognised immediately in the statement of financial position with a charge or credit to other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur. Remeasurements recognised in other comprehensive income are not reclassified. Current service costs are recognised in profit or loss within salaries and associated expenses, as are any past service costs such as those arising from curtailments or settlements. Gains or losses on settlement of a defined benefit plan are recognised when the settlement occurs. Interest is calculated by applying a discount rate to the net defined benefit liability or asset and is recognised within finance costs (note 8). Defined benefit costs are split into three categories: - Service costs, which includes current service cost and past service cost; and - Interest on the pension obligation; and - Remeasurement of net pension obligation, which includes: - The impact on the liabilities of changes in financial assumptions, which are based on market conditions at the reporting date, and demographic assumptions, such as life expectancy, compared with those adopted at the start of the year; and - The impact on the liabilities of actual experience being different to assumptions made at the start of the year; and - The return on plan assets above or below the interest income on those plan assets. The net pension obligation (or pension surplus) recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position represents the deficit (or surplus) in a defined benefit plan. Any surplus is limited to the present value of any economic benefits available in the form of refunds from the plans or reductions in future contributions to the plans. ----- ###### FINANCIAL STATEMENTS",N/A,as_expected,2024,879

Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control nor joint control over those policies. The results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in the consolidated financial statements as a single line in each of the statement of financial position and the statement of profit or loss using the equity method of accounting. The consolidated statement of financial position therefore includes investment in associates measured at cost as adjusted for post-acquisition changes in the Group’s economic share of the net assets of the associate, less any impairment in the value of the investment, but the carrying amount cannot fall below zero. The consolidated income statement includes a share of the profit or loss of the associate. Joint arrangements The Group applies IFRS 11 ‘Joint Arrangements’ to all joint arrangements. Investments in joint arrangements are, as required by IFRS 11, classified as either joint operations or joint ventures, depending on the contractual rights and obligations of each investor. The Group has assessed the nature of its joint arrangements and has determined them to be joint ventures. Joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method, in a similar manner to associates. ----- ###### FINANCIAL STATEMENTS",N/A,as_expected,2024,879

Their fair value is calculated as the sum of the present value of projected cash flows in excess of returns on contributory assets over the life of the relationship with the customers. These assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of between 5 and 10 years, which is estimated by reference to the history of the relationships and levels of attrition. Distribution network Distribution network intangible assets are recognised on a business combination because the acquirer is able to benefit from already established distribution channels. Their fair value is calculated as the sum of the present value of projected future cash flows generated by existing distribution channels. These assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of 10 years, which is estimated by reference to the history of the relationships and levels of attrition. Brand Brand intangible assets are recognised on a business combination because they are separable or arise from contractual or other legal rights. Their fair value is calculated as the sum of the present value of projected royalty payments that would be paid to license the right to use the brand. These assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of between 1 and 10 years, which considers the Group’s track record of retaining brands and experience of the insurance broking market. Computer software Computer software is recognised when purchased separately, when acquired as part of a business combination, or when internally-generated. The fair value of computer software that is purchased separately is calculated by reference to the amount paid. The fair value of computer software that is acquired as part of a business combination is calculated using the depreciated replacement cost or relief from royalty approach. The fair value of internally-generated computer software is calculated as described below. These assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life of 4 years. Internally-generated computer software and assets under construction (unless acquired on a business combination) Expenditure on research activities is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred. An internally-generated intangible asset arising from the development of computer software is recognised if, and only if, all the following conditions have been demonstrated: - the technical feasibility of completing the asset so that it will be available for use or sale; - the intention to complete the asset and to use or sell it; - the ability to use or sell the asset; - how the asset will generate future economic benefits; - the availability of adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the asset; and - the ability to measure reliably the expenditure attributable to the asset during its development. The amount initially recognised is the sum of the expenditure incurred from the date when the intangible asset first meets the recognition criteria listed above and is classified as an asset under construction. Where no internally-generated intangible asset can be recognised, development expenditure is recognised in profit or loss in the period in which it is incurred. Internally-generated intangible assets are not amortised in the period subsequent to initial recognition but before they are ready for use. Amortisation commences when they are ready for use as intended by management. They are then reported at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, on the same basis as intangible assets that are acquired separately. Internally-generated intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life of 4 years. ----- ###### FINANCIAL STATEMENTS",N/A,as_expected,2024,879

Property, plant and equipment is derecognised on disposal, or when no future economic benefits are expected from use or disposal. Gains or losses arising from derecognition of property, plant and equipment, measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset, are recognised in profit or loss when the asset is derecognised. ----- ###### FINANCIAL STATEMENTS",N/A,as_expected,2024,879

Right-of-use assets The Group recognises right-of-use assets at the commencement date of the lease (i.e. the date the underlying asset is available for use). Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and are adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liabilities. The cost of right-of-use assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognised, initial direct costs incurred, lease payments made at or before the commencement date of the lease less any lease incentives received, plus the estimated costs of restoring the underlying asset to the condition required by the terms of the lease. Unless the Group is reasonably certain to obtain ownership of the leased asset at the end of the lease term, the recognised rightof-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the estimated useful life and the lease term. Right-ofuse assets are subject to impairment. Lease liabilities At the commencement date of the lease, the Group recognises lease liabilities measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term. The lease payments include fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments) less any lease incentives receivable, variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, and amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees. The lease payments also include the exercise price of a purchase option reasonably certain to be exercised by the Group and payments of penalties for terminating a lease if the lease term reflects the Group exercising the option to terminate. The variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognised as an expense in the period on which the event or condition that triggers the payment occurs. In calculating the present value of lease payments, the Group uses the incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date if the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable, which is generally the case. After the commencement date, the amount of lease liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of interest and it is reduced for the lease payments made. In addition, the carrying amount of lease liabilities is remeasured if there is a modification, a change in the lease term, a change in the in-substance fixed lease payments or a change in the assessment to purchase the underlying asset. Leases of low value assets The Group elects on a lease-by-lease basis whether to apply the lease of low-value assets exemption to non-property leases that are considered to be of low value (i.e. below £5,000). Where the exemption is applied, lease payments on leases of low-value assets are recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Subleases The Group does not undertake arrangements as a lessor other than as a sublessor. When the Group is a sublessor, it classifies the sublease as a finance lease if the sublease transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the asset that is the subject of the sublease, namely the right-of-use asset arising from the head lease. The sublease is otherwise classified as an operating lease. ----- ###### FINANCIAL STATEMENTS",N/A,as_expected,2024,879

Transaction costs arising on the issue of a financial asset or financial liability are accounted for as follows: - Transaction costs are added to or deducted from the fair value of the financial asset or financial liability if they are directly attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset or financial liability, respectively, and if the financial asset is measured at fair value through other comprehensive income or if the financial asset or financial liability, respectively, is measured at amortised cost. - Transaction costs are recognised immediately in profit or loss if they are directly attributable to the issue of a financial asset or financial liability at fair value through profit or loss, or if they are not directly attributable to the issue of a financial asset or financial liability. Derecognition Financial assets are derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire, or the Group transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred. On derecognition of a financial asset measured at amortised cost, the difference between the asset's carrying amount and the sum of the consideration received and receivable is recognised in profit or loss. On derecognition of an investment in an equity instrument which the Group has elected on initial recognition to measure at fair value through other comprehensive income, the cumulative gain or loss previously accumulated in equity is not reclassified to profit or loss but is included in retained earnings. A financial liability is derecognised when it is extinguished, discharged, cancelled or expires. The difference between the carrying value of the financial liability and the consideration paid and payable, including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed, is recognised in profit or loss. Where an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability. Offsetting Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset, and the net amount presented in the statement of financial position when, and only when, the Group currently has a legally enforceable right to set off the amounts and it intends either to settle them on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. Classification and subsequent measurement of financial assets The Group classifies its financial assets in the following measurement categories: - Amortised cost; - Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI); or - Fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL). All recognised financial assets are subsequently measured in their entirety at either amortised cost or fair value, depending on their classification. ----- ###### FINANCIAL STATEMENTS",N/A,as_expected,2024,879

The Group charges fees and retains a portion of the policy premiums as commission. Premiums are typically collected on an annual basis, at or near contract inception (which could be up to 60 days from contract inception).

Capitalised costs are released to profit or loss on inception or renewal of the contract with the customer, which normally takes place within one to three months of the reporting period. - Costs to obtain – incremental fees paid to distributors (usually aggregator websites) for obtaining new business. These costs are amortised, on a systematic basis that is consistent with the transfer to the customer of the goods or services to which the asset relates, over the average life of the relationship with the customer.

Other assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may exceed its recoverable amount. The last annual impairment test was performed as at 1 October 2022. An impairment test of an asset or cash-generating unit (or group of cash-generating units) is performed by comparing its carrying amount with its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use, where its value in use is the present value of its future cash flows. An impairment test requires the application of significant judgement because it relies on key assumptions, including forecast cash flows, a discount rate, a terminal growth rate and an Adjusted EBITDA multiple. Goodwill arising from a new business combination is, for the purposes of impairment testing, allocated to those cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the goodwill that was acquired. Impairment testing is performed at the level of the smallest groups of cash-generating units at which goodwill is monitored, known as the divisions. Forecast cash flows used in the value in use calculation were determined by considering historic business performance, by overlaying it with assumptions to reflect areas where growth or income improvement was expected, and by taking into account the expected results of cost management programmes to which the Group was committed. These forecasts were extrapolated to subsequent years using a steady growth rate being the CPI inflation rate of 3.8%, and a terminal value was calculated using the perpetual growth model. The discount rate of 9.16% to 10.79% that was applied to the forecasts was a market participant weighted average cost of capital calculated by reference to the Capital Asset Pricing Model. The fair value of the Group was calculated based on multiples of forecast 2022 Adjusted EBITDA and on information provided by external advisors, where that information is based on recent transactions in the insurance broking industry. The fair value of a division was estimated by apportioning the fair value of the Group between the divisions based on the value in use of each division. The estimated costs of disposal are assumed, based on market experience, to be 1.5% of the fair value of the division. See note 11 for the carrying values of goodwill and intangible assets at the period end. ----- ###### FINANCIAL STATEMENTS",N/A,as_expected,2024,879

A summary of goodwill allocated to the divisions is presented in the tables below: ----- An impairment test of goodwill is performed by comparing the carrying amount of each division (i.e. CGU or group of CGUs), including the goodwill, with the recoverable amount of the division. The recoverable amount of a division is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal (FVLCD) and its value in use (VIU), where the VIU of the division is the present value of its future cash flows. If the recoverable amount of a division is lower than its carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised. The impairment test of the divisions as at 1 October 2022 resulted in an impairment charge of £41m to goodwill in MGA division. The impairment loss of £41m in MGA division is driven by a decrease in forecasted cashflows of the business as compared to previous assessment and increase in the discount rate due to the prevailing economic environment. The impairment charge is recorded within depreciation, amortisation and impairment of non-financial assets line in the statement of profit or loss. Following the impairment test but during the year, MGA business was reorganised and transferred to Retail, Advisory and Capital Solutions based on synergies with the respective divisions. The key data is summarised in the following tables: Further information is provided below about the amounts in the above tables: - _Goodwill: The ‘Interdivision reclassifications’ column in table 1 reflects the impact on goodwill of the reclassification of certain businesses between divisions during the period presented. There were no interdivision reclassifications during the period from 1 October 2021 to 1 October 2022. The ‘Foreign exchange’ column in table 1 reflects the retranslation, using the exchange rate at the reporting date, of goodwill that resulted from the acquisition of a foreign operation. The ‘Acquisitions and disposals’ column in table 1 reflects the impact on goodwill of the acquisitions by the Group during the period to 1 October 2022 of: - The share capital of Hooper Dolan companies, the goodwill of which is included in the Europe division; - The share capital of Ed Broking and Besso companies, the goodwill of which is included in the Specialty division; - The share capital of Lorega Holdings Limited, the goodwill of which is included in the Advisory division; - The share capital of Stuart Insurances Limited, the goodwill of which is included in the Europe division; - The business and assets of Oneglobal Broking Limited, the goodwill of which is included in the Specialty division; - The goodwill of various other individually not material businesses. - _Carrying amount: The ‘Carrying amount’ column in table 3 includes the carrying amounts of the divisions. These amounts are determined by adding back external debt and lease liabilities to the net assets of each division and the Corporate non-operating segment, by allocating the resulting adjusted net assets of the Corporate non-operating segment across the divisions pro rata to the resulting adjusted net assets of each division, and by adding these amounts to the goodwill of the divisions after first grossing that goodwill up for the non-controlling interest. - _Value in use: The ‘VIU’ column in table 2 includes the present value of future cash flows of the divisions together with an allocation of the cash flows of the Corporate non-operating segment, where the cash flows are based on the most recent five-year forecast for Adjusted EBITDA as approved by management, pro forma for completed transactions as at 1 October 2022. These forecasts were determined by considering historic business performance, by overlaying it with assumptions to reflect areas where growth or income improvement is expected, and by taking into account the expected results of cost management programmes to which the Group is committed. The 2027 forecast is extrapolated to subsequent years using a steady growth rate being the forecast CPI inflation rate of 3.8% per annum, and a terminal value is calculated using the perpetual growth model. The discount rates that have been applied to the forecasts, in particular 10.33% for Advisory, 10.33% for Retail, 10.26% for Specialty, 10.15% for MGA, 9.39% for Europe, and 10.85% for Global Partners, are market participant weighted average cost of capitals calculated by reference to the Capital Asset Pricing Model. - _Fair value less costs of disposal: The ‘FVLCD’ column in table 2 is determined by reference to the fair value of the Group, which is calculated based on multiples of forecast 2023 Adjusted EBITDA and on information provided by external advisors. The estimated costs of disposal, which are assumed based on market experience to be 1.5% of the fair value of the division, are then deducted to determine the FVLCD of the division. - _Recoverable amount: The ‘Recoverable amount’ column in tables 2 and 3 is equal to the VIU for all divisions, as VIU is greater than FVLCD in all cases. ###### FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ----- The key assumption to which the VIU and thus the recoverable amount is most sensitive is the five-year forecast for Adjusted EBITDA. If the five-year forecast for Adjusted EBITDA were to be further decreased by 10%, impairment to the MGA division will be increased to £57m. If the five-year forecast for Adjusted EBITDA were to be decreased by 65.85%, there would also be an impairment to the Global Partners division. If the five-year forecast for Adjusted EBITDA were to be decreased by 66,41%, there would also be an impairment to the Europe division. If the five-year forecast for Adjusted EBITDA were to be decreased by 67.04%, there would also be an impairment to the Advisory division. No further reasonably possible change in this assumption alone would result in an impairment to any other CGU.",N/A,as_expected,2024,879

Goodwill is tested for impairment annually, and whenever there is an indication that it may be impaired. The annual impairment test is performed as at 1 October each year. An impairment, if any, that results from that annual impairment test would be reflected in the 31 December financial statements. Goodwill is, for the purposes of impairment testing, allocated to CGUs or groups of CGUs expected to benefit from the business combination associated with that goodwill, where a CGU is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generate independent cash inflows. Management reviewed business performance, as at 1 October 2022, based on the CGUs or groups of CGUs that are divisions. The divisions represented the lowest level within the Group at which goodwill was monitored for internal management purposes, so the annual impairment test was performed by reference to the divisions. ----- ###### FINANCIAL STATEMENTS",N/A,as_expected,2024,879

Some of the Group’s leases are being held over beyond the original end date of the lease. Rent is normally fixed but may be subject to a review every few years. Many of the Group’s long-term contracts have an option to terminate the lease prior to its end date, but in most cases termination options are not reasonably certain to be exercised so that the lease liability reflects all lease payments through to the ultimate end date of the lease. Service charges and other contractual payments to the lessor are excluded from the measurement of the lease liability. VAT (including when it is irrecoverable) and business rates are also excluded from the measurement of the lease liability as they do not constitute a lease payment under IFRS 16. The Group does not act as a lessor other than as a sublessor. Subleases are not considered material for the Group. Leases of low value assets, for which the Group applies the practical expedient not to recognise a lease liability, are not considered material for the Group.

The significant measurement period adjustments are listed below: - Acquisition of Ed Broking Group Limited and Besso Insurance Group Limited (the ‘Ed Broking and Besso companies’) – A measurement period adjustment was recorded to adjust the estimated net asset recoverable figure, to correct an investment value, add a provision for an E&O liability and an accrual for bonuses payable along with other re-allocations. Following these adjustments and the receipt of the external purchase price allocation report (‘PPA report’) the identifiable intangible assets were re-classified and as a result customer relationships reduced by £(47.9)m, brand reduced by £(3.2)m, Intellectual property increased by £5.6m and the deferred tax liability reduced by £12.1m. As a result, Goodwill increased by £62.0m. - Acquisition of AccuRisk Solutions LLC – A measurement period adjustment was recorded to allocate the identifiable intangible assets recognised on acquisition. Customer relationships decreased by £(3.4)m, brand increased by £0.8m and the deferred tax liability decreased by £2.4m. As a result, Goodwill increased by £0.2m. - Acquisition of Usay Group Limited – A measurement period adjustment was recorded to allocate the identifiable intangibles recognised on acquisition. Customer relationships decreased by £(6.0)m, brand increased by £4.3m, intellectual property increased by £2.4m and the deferred tax liability decreased by £1.0m. As a result, Goodwill decreased by £(0.6)m. - Acquisition of the Hooper Dolan companies – A measurement period adjustment was recorded to allocate the identifiable intangibles recognised on acquisition. Customer relationships increased by £8.3m, brand increased by £0.2m and the deferred tax liability increased by £(1.1)m. As a result, Goodwill decreased by £(7.3)m. The acquisitions were accounted for under IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’, which requires that the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed, including certain contingent liabilities, are measured at their acquisition date fair value. Goodwill is calculated as the difference between the acquisition consideration and the acquisition date fair value of the net assets/(liabilities) acquired. Goodwill represents expected synergies from combining operations of the acquiree and the Group, and/or intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition, and is allocated to the acquirer’s cash generating units, or groups of cash-generating units, that are expected to benefit from the synergies from combing operations of the acquiree and the Group. The amounts recognised in the year end consolidated financial statements are all provisional for 2022 acquisitions and adjustments may occur during the remainder of the measurement period, which is twelve months from the date of acquisition. The revenue and loss of the combined entity for the current reporting period as though the acquisition date for all business combinations that occurred during the year had been as of the beginning of the annual reporting period is disclosed in Section 3. ###### FINANCIAL STATEMENTS",N/A,as_expected,2024,879

Actual credit loss experience is, where appropriate, adjusted by scalar factors to reflect differences between economic conditions during the period over which the historical data was collected, current conditions and the Group’s view of economic conditions over the expected lives of the receivables. The scalar factors are based on GDP and unemployment rate forecasts (source: HM Treasury ‘Forecasts for the UK Economy’) and include the following: - GDP: A 119.02% decrease in the growth in GDP is expected, from 4.08% in 2022 to (0.78%) in 2023 which indicates that historical credit loss experience should be increased. - Unemployment rate: A 14.57% increase in unemployment rates is expected, from 3.78% in 2022 to 4.33% in 2023, which indicates that historical credit loss experience should be increased.

In assessing the probability of recovery of the deferred tax assets, a review is undertaken of the 5 year forecasts and other assumptions relating to future profitability. Where applicable, these deferred tax assets are limited to the level of the consolidated deferred tax liability, as an estimate of the reasonableness of future profitability within the Ardonagh Group. This deferred tax liability has been taken at the level of Ardonagh Group Holdings Limited as this is the level at which the group is managed at and provides the basis for the measurement of deferred tax for group subsidiary companies. The total gross deferred tax liability at the AGHL level is £337m, with a total deferred tax asset of £152m resulting in a net deferred tax liability of £185m. The total gross deferred tax liability at Midco2 is £166m, with a total deferred tax asset of £148m resulting in a net deferred tax liability of £18m. . Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are only offset if there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities, and if they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on the same taxable entity or on different taxable entities which intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously. As a result of offsetting the net deferred tax liability of £18m comprises a deferred tax asset of £34m relating to UK and a deferred tax liability of £52m relating to non UK jurisdictions. In the March 2021 Budget, it was announced that the UK Corporation Tax Rate will rise from its current rate of 19% to 25% with effect from April 2023. UK deferred tax balances as at 31 December 2022 are measured at the rate that the respective assets and liabilities will reverse.

Opinion In our opinion: - the financial statements of Ardonagh Midco 2 Pie (the 'parent company') and its subsidiaries (the 'group') give a true and fair view of the state of the group's and of the parent company's affairs as at 31 December 2021 and of the group's loss for the year then ended; - the group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom adopted international accounting standards; - the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice, including Financial Reporting Standard 101 ""Reduced Disclosure Framework""; and - the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006. We have audited the financial statements which comprise: - the consolidated statement of profit and loss and other comprehensive income; - the consolidated and parent company statements of financial position; - the consolidated and parent company statements of changes in equity; - the consolidated statement of cash flows; and - the related notes 1 to 37 and 1 to 14. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the group financial statements is applicable law, and United Kingdom adopted international accounting standards. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the parent company financial statements is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including FRS 101 ""Reduced Disclosure Framework"" (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice). 2. Basis for opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the group and the parent company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the Financial Reporting Council's (the 'FRC's') Ethical Standard as applied to listed entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. 3. Summary of our audit approach Key audit matters The key audit matters that we identified in the current year were: Going concern; Acquisition accounting under IFRS 3 Business Combinations - Bravo; Goodwill impairment; Presentation of Alternative Performance Measures ('APMs'); Revenue recognition - Estimation of Variable Consideration reported in Commissions and fees and revaluation of the trail commission asset acquired with Swinton (""Swinton Monthly Products asset"") reported in Other income; and Preference share issue: classification as debt or equity. In our opinion: - the financial statements of Ardonagh Midco 2 Pie (the 'parent company') and its subsidiaries (the 'group') give a true and fair view of the state of the group's and of the parent company's affairs as at 31 December 2021 and of the group's loss for the year then ended; - the group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom adopted international accounting standards; - the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice, including Financial Reporting Standard 101 ""Reduced Disclosure Framework""; and - the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006. -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,879

Scoping coverage included 9 components subject to full scope audits and a further 9 subject to the audit of specified account balances. These scoped in entities represent 82% of group Revenue and 84% of group total cash. There have been no significant changes to our audit approach compared to the prior year except for changes in the key audit matters as described below. In the current year, the Preference share issue: classification as debt or equity and Acquisition accounting under IFRS 3 business combinations - Bravo, were both considered Key Audit Matters given the significance of the preference share issue and the Bravo acquisition to the group. The Enhanced Transfer Value (""ETV"") provision is no longer considered a Key Audit Matter as the ETV redress programme is nearing completion with the net ETV provision being considered not material. 4. Conclusions relating to going concern In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate. Our evaluation of the directors' assessment of the group's and parent company's ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting is discussed in section 5.1. Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the group's and parent company's ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue. Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections of this report. 5. Key audit matters Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we identified. These matters included those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.",N/A,as_expected,2024,879

Going Concern@,100.303.1,,"Key audit matter Management makes an assessment of the group's ability to continue as a going concern, taking into description** account all available information about the future, which is at least, but is not limited to, twelve months from the date when the financial statements are authorised for issue. The Directors' ----- concluded that it is appropriate to prepare the financial statements for the 12 months ended 31 December 2021 on a going concern basis. As at 31 December 2021 the group has debt (current and non-current) amounting to £2,67Sm (2020: £1,969m). The borrowings include $500m payment-in-kind (""PIK"") toggle notes due 2027, a privately placed term loan facility due 2026 of £1,57Sm, a £300m committed Capex, Acquisition and Re­ organisation (""CAR"") facility due 2026 and a $540m CAR facility due 2026. Under the terms of the debt arrangements the group also continues to benefit from the availability of a Revolving Credit Facility (""RCF""). The group's finance costs on bank and other borrowings give rise to annual interest costs of £217.4m (?020: £136.4m), which are considered within year end forecast cash flows. As part of their going concern assessment, the Directors have considered the principal risks facing the group, including the potential continued financial and operational impacts of Covid-19, and its systems of risk management and internal control. In the light of the economic uncertainty caused by Covid-19 the Directors have considered key stress scenarios as follows: - Shortfalls in base case projected income throughout 2022 and 2023; - Deterioration in base case cash conversion rates over and above the shortfalls in income; and Mitigating actions within management control including delayed capital expenditure, a reduction in discretionary spend and some reduction in employee headcount and remuneration. Auditing the going concern assessment involved subjective judgement and an increased extent of effort, including the rieed to make additional enquiries of management outside of the finance function. Refer to Note 2 to the financial statements for the basis of preparation. How the scope of our audit** We have gained an understanding of management's process for performing the going concern responded to the key audit** assessment and obtained an understanding of relevant controls.",N/A,as_expected,2024,879
1923_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,100,NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,100.304,matter,100.304.1,,"We performed the following audit procedures: - We evaluated and challenged key assumptions underpinning cash flow forecasts, the stresses applied and the reverse stress test. In particular we compared market forecast assumptions for 2022 and 2023 with the actual performance in 2021 compared to the revised budgets developed in March 2021. - We assessed mitigating cost actions within management's control and tested the availability of the RCF and compliance with debt covenants; - We made inquiries of senior management in relation to their assessment of the continued operational impacts of Covid -19 on the group including inquiries regarding business resilience; - We inspected correspondence between the group and its regulators - We performed an analysis of the group's financial performance in the first two months after the balance sheet date; and - We assessed financial statement disclosures in respect of going concern for transparency and inclusion of all facts and circumstances of which we are aware through the performance of the audit work. Key observations We concur with the Directors' conclusion that it is appropriate to prepare the financial statements for the 12 months ended 31 December 2021 on a going concern basis. ----- 5.2. Goodwill Impairment** @ Key audit matter** Goodwill arising on business combinations is a significant asset on the balance sheet of the group description** £1,619.6m (2020: £1,192.0m). Goodwill increased significantly during 2021 following significant acquisitions. As required by IAS 36 Impairment of Assets, goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually. Management concluded no impairment was required. During 2021 the group continued to monitor goodwill at the division level as this remained the lowest level of aggregation of cash generating units within the group at which goodwill could be monitored for management purposes. Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the recoverable amount of each division, using the higher of value in use (""VIU"") and fair value less costs to dispose (""FVLCD""). The VIU amount is subjective and calculated using an impairment model underpinned by key assumptions including forecast cash flows, discount rates and long-term growth rates. Management use a VIU approach to assess the recoverable amount of all divisions. A headroom calculation is performed as the amount of calculated VIU above the carrying value of the division.

The E shares accumulate dividends semi-annually in arrears on 30 June and 31 December, which are deferred and not declared unless the Company, the issuer, elects to pay them in cash. The dividends accumulate based on a 360-day year at a rate of 12.5% per annum, or at a rate of 11.5% per annum for the relevant accumulation period if the Company elects to declare and pay the dividend rather than to defer and thus not declare nor pay it. The E shares have no maturity date, but they are redeemable at any time at the option of the Company. The E shares are classified as equity as there is no contractual obligation to pay a dividend or interest, there is no contractual obligation to redeem them, and the holder of the E shares does not have a put option over them. The declaration and payment of dividends and the redemption of the E shares are all at the option of the Company.",N/A,as_expected,2024,879

These arrangements adjust the consideration that the Group is entitled to for satisfying its performance obligations, and the amount and timing of revenue subject to these arrangements is inherently uncertain. The Group applies judgement in estimating the related variable consideration, which is measured on a best estimate basis using either the 'expected value' method or the 'most likely amount' method, and which is recognised to the extent that a significant reversal will not occur (a constraint). In making the estimate, the Group uses historical, current and forecast information that is reasonably available to it. A higher constraint (in some cases, full constraint) is applied when the results underlying these arrangements are highly susceptible to factors outside the Group's influence or when the Group's experience has limited predictive value. Estimates of the variable consideration are assessed at the end of each reporting period to determine whether they need to be revised. The underwriting results are reviewed by the Group and the insurer on a regular basis, and information provided by the insurer is used to refine the estimated amount of consideration. As the underwriting results become more certain, the constraint is relaxed. As at 31 December 2021, a loss corridor liability of £4.2m (2020: £5.0m) is included within trade and other payables and a variable profit commission of £18.Sm (2020: £6.Bm) is included within contract assets. Fair value gains and losses on financial assets at FVTPL are recognised on a business combination in relation to the Group's right to variable consideration on rolling contracts with customers for which the performance obligation was satisfied prior to the acquisition. The fair value of the Swinton rolling contract (a closed book of business) is a level 3 valuation, in accordance with IFRS 13 'Fair Value Measurement', the key assumptions of which are (a) the product lifetime restrictions of 12, 24 and 36 months for the Home Emergency Cover, Swinton Breakdown Insurance, and Personal Accident products, (b) the discount rate, which is based on the Ardonagh weighted average cost of capital (WACC), and (c) the lapse rate curves, which are estimated based on historical experience. A one-year increase in the product lifetime restrictions across all three products would give rise to a £0.2m increase in other income in 2021. A 1% increase in the discount rate would give rise to a £5.9m decrease in other income in 2021. The financial asset corresponding to the Swinton rolling contract is £26.0m as at 31 December 2021 (2020: £24.Bm). ----- ###### FINANCIAL STATEMENTS",N/A,as_expected,2024,879

Other assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may exceed its recoverable amount. The last annual impairment test was performed as at 1 October 2021. An impairment test of an asset or cash-generating unit (or group of cash-generating units) is performed by comparing its carrying amount with its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use, where its value in use is the present value of its future cash flows. An impairment test requires the application of significant judgement because it relies on key assumptions, including forecast cash flows, a discount rate, a terminal growth rate and an Adjusted EBITDA multiple. Goodwill arising from a new business combination is, for the purposes of impairment testing, allocated to those cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the goodwill that was acquired. Impairment testing is performed at the level of the smallest groups of cash-generating units at which goodwill is monitored, known as the ""divisions"". Forecast cash flows used in the value in use calculation were determined by considering historic business performance, by overlaying it with assumptions to reflect areas where growth or income improvement was expected, and by taking into account the expected results of cost management programmes to which the Group was committed. These forecasts were extrapolated to subsequent years using a steady growth rate being the CPI inflation rate of 1.9% (2020: 1.7%), and a terminal value was calculated using the perpetual growth model. The discount rate of 9.67% (2020: 9.84%) that was applied to the forecasts was a market participant weighted average cost of capital calculated by reference to the Capital Asset Pricing Model. The fair value of the Group was calculated based on multiples of forecast 2021 Adjusted EBITDA and on information provided by external advisors, where that information is based on recent transactions in the insurance broking industry. The fair value of a division was estimated by apportioning the fair value of the Group between the divisions based on the value in use of each division. The estimated costs of disposal are assumed, based on market experience, to be 1.5% of the fair value of the division. ----- ###### FINANCIAL STATEMENTS",N/A,as_expected,2024,879

There was an amendment to the terms of the term facilities due 2026 debt arrangements on 19 August 2021, reducing the margin on the term facilities due 2026 by 0.25% to the nominal interest rates set out in note 29 and removing the PIK option from these facilities. This was accounted for as a modification as the cash flows of the amended debt compared to the remaining cash flows of the original debt were, when both were discounted using the original effective interest rate, less than 10% different, such that it was concluded that the amendment did not constitute a substantial change to the debt arrangements. A £20.7m modification gain has been recognised in the income statement, within finance costs, and the carrying amount of the debt has been adjusted accordingly. On 18 November 2021, the margins on the term facility due 2026 were further reduced by 0.50% due to change to the consolidated senior net leverage ratio. This reduction is not a change in market interest rates (it is specific to the Group) and thus has been accounted for by adjusting the carrying amount of the debt to reflect the revised estimated cash flows using the original effective interest rate.

The recoverable amount of a division is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal ('FVLCD') and its value in use ('VIU'), where the VIU of the division is the present value of its future cash flows. If the recoverable amount of a division is lower than its carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised. The impairment test of the divisions as at 1 October 2021 (and 1 October 2020) did not result in an impairment charge to goodwill.

The 'Foreign exchange' column in table 1 reflects the retranslation, using the exchange rate at the reporting date, of goodwill that resulted from the acquisition of a foreign operation. The 'Acquisitions and disposals' column in table_ 1 reflects the impact on goodwill of the acquisitions by the Group during the 12 month period to 1 October 2021: The share capital of Marmalade Limited, the goodwill of which is included in the Retail division; The share capital of Headley Holdings Limited, of Hera Indemnity Limited, of Drayton Ins. Limited and of Usay Group Limited, the goodwill of which is included in the Advisory division; The share capital of Brian J Pierce Limited, the goodwill of which is included in the Europe division; The share capital of Resilium Bidco Pty Limited and of AccuRisk Solutions LLC, and a business and certain assets of Helmsley Wynne Furlonge LLP, the goodwill of which is included in the Global Partners division; The share capital of Sino Insurance Brokers Limited, the goodwill of which is included in the Specialty division; The goodwill of various other individually immaterial businesses. (2020: The 'Acquisitions and disposals' column in table 1 reflects the impact on goodwill of the acquisitions by the Group during the 12 month period to 1 October 2020 of a business and certain assets of Rural Insurance, the goodwill of which is included in the MGA division, of the share capital of Nevada 4 Midco 1 Limited, the goodwill of which is included in the Insurance Broking division, of the share capital of Nevada 5 Topco Limited, the goodwill of which is included in the Arachas division, of the share capital of Nevada 4 Midco 1 Limited, the parent of Bravo Investment Holdings Limited, the goodwill of which is included in the Insurance Broking division, of the share capital of Thames Underwriting Limited, the goodwill of which is included in the MGA division, of the share capital of Lloyd Latchford Group Limited, the goodwill of which is included in the Retail division, and of various other individually immaterial businesses.) The term 'Adjusted' has been used to describe goodwill as at 1 October 2020 in table 1 because it reflects the disposal by the Group of Milburn Insurance Brokers even though that disposal occurred after 1 October 2020. This was to ensure that the goodwill and thus the carrying amount as at 1 October 2020 was determined in a way that was consistent with the recoverable amount as at 1 October 2020, which was based on forecasts that reflected that disposal as if it had already occurred. ----- ###### FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - _Carrying amount: The 'Carrying amount' column in table 3 includes the carrying amounts of the divisions. These amounts are determined by adding back external debt and lease liabilities to the net assets of each division and the Corporate non-operating division, by allocating the resulting adjusted net assets of the Corporate non-operating division across the divisions pro rata to the resulting adjusted net assets of each division, and by adding these amounts to the goodwill of the divisions after first grossing that goodwill up for the non-controlling interest. - _Value in use: The 'VIU' column in table 2 includes the present value of future cash flows of the divisions together with an allocation of the cash flows of the Corporate non-operating division, where the cash flows are based on the most recent five­ year forecast for Adjusted EBITDA as approved by management, pro forma for completed transactions as at 1 October 2021 (2020: 1 October 2020). These forecasts were determined by considering historic business performance, by overlaying it with assumptions to reflect areas where growth or income improvement is expected, and by taking into account the expected results of cost management programmes to which the Group is committed. The 2026 forecast (2020: 2025 forecast) is extrapolated to subsequent years using a steady growth rate being the CPI inflation rate of 1.9% per annum (2020: CPI inflation rate of 1.7% per annum), and a terminal value is calculated using the perpetual growth model. The discount rate of 9.67% (2020: 9.84%) that has been applied to the forecasts is a market participant weighted average cost of capital calculated by reference to the Capital Asset Pricing Model. - _Fair value less costs of disposal: The 'FVLCD' column in table 2 is determined by reference to the fair value of the Group, which is calculated based on multiples of forecast 2022 (2020: forecast 2021) Adjusted EBITDA and on information provided by external advisors. The fair value of a CGU is estimated using a valuation technique that makes use of level 3 inputs, in accordance with IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement, specifically by apportioning the fair value of the Group between the divisions based on the VIU of each division. The estimated costs of disposal, which are assumed based on market experience to be 1.5% (2020: 1.5%) of the fair value of the division, are then deducted to determine the FVLCD of the division. - _Recoverable amount: The 'Recoverable amount' column in tables 2 and 3 is equal to the VIU for all divisions, as VIU is greater than FVLCD in all cases. The key assumption to which the VIU and thus the recoverable amount is most sensitive is the five-year forecast for Adjusted EBITDA. If the five-year forecast for Adjusted EBITDA were to be decreased by 29.06% (2020: 41.91%), there would be an impairment to the MGA division. If the five-year forecast for Adjusted EBITDA were to be decreased by 30.69% (2020: 20.16%) there would also be an impairment to the Europe division. If the five-year forecast for Adjusted EBITDA were to be decreased by 61.47% (2020: 40.42%), there would also be an impairment to the Advisory division. No further reasonably possible change in this assumption alone would result in an impairment to any other CGU. ----- ###### FINANCIAL STATEMENTS",N/A,as_expected,2024,879

'Foreign exchange' arises from the retranslation, using the exchange rate at the reporting date, of goodwill that resulted from the acquisition of a foreign operation. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually, and whenever there is an indication that it may be impaired. The annual impairment test is performed as at 1 October each year. An impairment, if any, that results from that annual impairment test would be reflected in the 31 December financial statements. Goodwill is, for the purposes of impairment testing, allocated to CGUs or groups of CGUs expected to benefit from the business combination associated with that goodwill, where a CGU is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generate independent cash inflows. Management reviewed business performance, as at 1 October 2021 (and 1 October 2020), based on the CGUs or groups of CGUs that are divisions. The divisions represented the lowest level within the Group at which goodwill was monitored for internal management purposes, so the annual impairment test was performed by reference to the divisions. ----- ###### FINANCIAL STATEMENTS",N/A,as_expected,2024,879

Some of the Group's leases are being held over beyond the original end date of the lease. Rent is normally fixed but may be subject to a review every few years. Many of the Group's long-term contracts have an option to terminate the lease prior to its end date, but in most cases termination options are not reasonably certain to be exercised so that the lease liability reflects all lease payments through to the ultimate end date of the lease. Service charges and other contractual payments to the lessor are excluded from the measurement of the lease liability. VAT (including when it is irrecoverable) and business rates are also excluded from the measurement of the lease liability as they do not constitute a lease payment under IFRS 16. The Group does not act as a lessor other than as a sublessor. Subleases are not considered material for the Group. leases of low value assets, for which the Group applies the practical expedient not to recognise a lease liability, are not considered material for the Group.

The significant measurement period adjustments are listed below: - Acquisition of Nevada 5 Topco Limited (Arachas) - A measurement period adjustment was recorded on 31 March 2021 to allocate the intangibles recognised on acquisition and an adjustment to off-market leases resulting in a decrease to goodwill of £(1.2)m and an increase to customer relationships of £0.4m. - Acquisition of Nevada 4 Midco 1 Limited (Bravo) - A measurement period adjustment was recorded on 7 July 2021 to allocate the intangibles recognised on acquisition. Customer relationships increased by £36.Sm, brand by £2.0m, intellectual property by £1.Bm and deferred tax decreased by £(7.6)m. As a result, Goodwill decreased by £(32.6)m. - Acquisition of Robus Group Limited - A measurement period adjustment was recorded on 30 June 2021 to allocate the intangibles recognised on acquisition. Customer relationships decreased by £(0.9)m, brand by £(0.l)m and deferred tax increased by £0.2m. As a result, goodwill increased by £(0.4)m. There was also an adjustment booked to the acquisition accounting resulting in a reduction to the price of the acquisition of £(0.4)m. - Acquisition of Lloyd Latchford - A measurement period adjustment was recorded on 30 April 2021 to reclassify the intangible recognised on acquisition. Customer relationships decreased by £(1.3)m, brand by £(0.l)m, computer software increased by £0.Sm and deferred tax by £0.lm. As a result, goodwill increased by £0.9m. The acquisitions were accounted for under IFRS 3 'Business Combinations', which requires that the identifiable assets acquired, and the liabilities assumed are measured at their acquisition date fair value. Goodwill is calculated as the difference between (a) the acquisition consideration plus the amount of any non-controlling interest, and (b) the acquisition date fair value of the net assets/(liabilities) acquired. The amounts recognised in the year end consolidated financial statements are provisional and adjustments may occur during the remainder of the measurement period. ----- ###### FINANCIAL STATEMENTS",N/A,as_expected,2024,879

This associate is initially recognised at cost and subsequently via the equity method, where the cost is the consideration comprising cash of HKD14.3m and contingent consideration with a fair value of HKD21.4m. The Group was entitled, under the terms of the acquisition of the 40% interest, to exercise a call option during the period 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2023 to acquire a further 35% interest in Sino Insurance Brokers Limited, comprising 350,000 ordinary shares of HKDl each. On 1 January 2021, the Group obtained control over Sino Insurance Brokers Limited as a result of the call option becoming currently exercisable (albeit not exercised) on and from that date. The call option, if exercised, enables the Group to increase its 40% holding in Sino Insurance Brokers Limited to 75%. Sino Insurance Brokers Limited and its subsidiaries had previously been accounted for as an associate, but they are consolidated from 1 January 2021 as a result of the Group obtaining control. The consideration paid on 1 January 2021 was £nil. The equity interest was remeasured on 1 January 2021 (a business combination achieved in stages) from its carrying amount of £4.lm to its fair value of £5.5m, giving rise to a £1.4m gain in the income statement, and it was then derecognised.

Variable consideration is a key source of estimation uncertainty (note 4). The increase to the contract assets balance during the year ending 31 December 2021 reflects a £5.lm impact of new acquisitions offset by a decrease of £(0.8)m in profit commissions. The estimated revenue relating to profit commission that was recognised in 2021 on policies incepted prior to 2021 amounts to £3.2m (2020: £6.4m related to policies incepted prior to 2020). This is generally due to re-estimation of amounts previously recognised and relaxation of the constraint on revenue as amounts become more certain. Contract liabilities represent the Group's obligation to transfer services to customers for which the Group has received the consideration (or the amount is due) from the customer. During the year ended 31 December 2021, the Group recognised revenue amounting to £30.9m (2020: £26.Sm) that was included in the opening balance of contract liabilities. Contract liabilities increased during the year ending 31 December 2021 mainly due 'to a £4.2m increase in Geo Underwriting Services Limited and £10.7m following the acquisition of the Ed Broking and Besso companies. The Group applies the practical expedient in IFRS 15 not to disclose information about the transaction price associated with performance obligations to be completed after the reporting date, if the performance obligation is part of a contract that has an original expected duration of one year or less. With respect to contracts with an original expected duration of more than a year, the aggregate amount of transaction price allocated to performance obligations that are unsatisfied (or partially satisfied) as of the reporting date is £22.7m (2020: £8.lm).

The scalar factors are based on GDP and unemployment rate forecasts (source: HM Treasury 'Forecasts for the UK Economy') and include the following: - GDP: A 26.32% decrease in the growth in GDP is expected, from 7.13% in 2021 to 5.25% in 2022, which indicates that historical credit loss experience should be increased (2020: a 147.89% increase in the growth in GDP was expected, from (10.65)% in 2020 to 5.1% in 2021, which indicated that historical credit loss experience should be decreased); and - Unemployment rate: A 7.03% decrease in unemployment rates is expected, from 4.63% in 2021 to 4.3% in 2022, which indicates that historical credit loss experience should be decreased (2020: a 12.61% increase in unemployment rates was expected, from 5.95% in 2020 to 6.7% in 2021, which indicated that historical credit loss experience should be increased).

The Group applied the amendments to IFRS 9 which allowed the Group to continue hedge accounting during the period of uncertainty arising from IBOR reforms. In assessing whether the hedge is expected to be highly effective on a forward-looking basis, the Group therefore assumed that the cash flows of the interest rate swaps and the hedged debt instruments are not altered by IBOR reform. The original LIBOR floating rate loan and original LIBOR interest rate swaps were modified so that the loan and swaps will reference a SONIA interest rate on each future interest reset date, and thus the Group no longer has exposure to LIBOR as at the reporting date. The Group has amended its hedge designations and documentation to reflect these changes. ----- At the reporting date the Group hedged its USO PIK toggle notes using forward contracts. Consequently, there is no net exposure to currency risk on the USO PIK toggle notes. The Group does not currently use derivative contracts to hedge the currency risk on its €180.0m privately placed term facility or its USO S40.0m CAR facility, but there is a natural currency hedge with the Euro investments and with the USO investment in Ed Broking Group Limited.

At the previous year end it was the intention of Management to enact the PIK option meaning the carrying amount of borrowings has taken this into account when calculating the effective interest rate, and in January 2021 the options were exercised. There was an amendment to the terms of the term facilities due 2026 debt arrangements on 19 August 2021, reducing the margin on the term facilities due 2026 by 0.25% to the nominal interest rates set out in the table above and removing the PIK option from these facilities. This was accounted for as a modification as the cash flows of the amended debt compared to the remaining cash flows of the original debt were, when both were discounted using the original effective interest rate, less than 10% different, such that it was concluded that the amendment did not constitute a substantial change to the debt arrangements. A £20. 7m modification gain has been recognised in the income statement, within finance costs, and the carrying amount of the debt has.been adjusted accordingly. On 18 November 2021, the margins on the term facility due 2026 were further reduced by 0.50% due to change to the consolidated senior net leverage ratio. This reduction is not a change in market interest rates (it is specific to the Group) and thus has been accounted for by adjusting the carrying amount of the debt to reflect the revised estimated cash flows using the original effective interest rate. A £23.4m gain has been recognised in the income statement, within finance costs. Interest is payable on the notes in January and July of each year.

These were replaced in 2020 by B ordinary shares of The Ardonagh Group Limited (TAGL Ordinary B shares), which are accounted for as an equity-settled share-based payment arrangement that modifies the existing arrangements and results in no incremental fair value at the modification date. The new Ardonagh MIP, comprising the Tier 1 arrangements and the Employee Growth Plan (EGP) scheme, were also issued in 2020, both of which are equity-settled share-based payment schemes with the corresponding shares being the MIP A and MIP B shares respectively. The fair value of the services received in exchange for the grant of the shares is recognised as an expense, measured based on the grant date fair value of the shares and recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. The TAGL Ordinary B shares and various MIP shares have no dividend or voting rights and can only be sold in limited circumstances. The Ardonagh and Atlanta MIP shares were granted in exchange for the nominal subscription price of £0.01 per share, whilst the subsequent EGP and Tier 1 arrangements were granted at fair value. They are convertible to ordinary shares of the Group on the occurrence of a crystallisation event, being the earlier of a liquidity event, an IPO and a winding-up. The Group has the option to repurchase shares if an employee leaves the Group prior to the occurrence of a crystallisation event, for an amount that depends on whether the employee is a 'good leaver' or 'bad leaver'. On 25 October 2021, the TAGL Tier 1 arrangements and Employee Growth Plan ('EGP') were modified by exchanging MIP A and MIP B shares held by employees for TAGL Ordinary B shares. In introducing the modification, the Group have acquired all of the MIP A and MIP B shares previously held by employees in exchange for issuing a total of 39,405,713 TAGL B Ordinary shares, which hold no voting rights and the value of which is impacted by leaver provisions that are attached to them. Also, on 26 October 2021, 55,050,994 of the TAGL Ordinary B shares that were held by employee minority shareholders and other individuals providing services to the Group were sold by those shareholders to a majority shareholder of the Group, and those TAGL Ordinary B shares were then exchanged for an equivalent number of ordinary shares in the TAGL.

On 25 February 2022, Resilium arranged an AUD 40m debt facility that can be drawn in tranches similar to the Group's CAR facilities outlined in note 29 Borrowings. Subject to customary closing conditions including regulatory approvals expected to close in the first half of 2022, Ardonagh anticipates a significant new equity investment into the Group led by existing long-term shareholders MDP and HPS, alongside new co-investors through accounts managed by MDP and HPS, including a wholly owned subsidiary of the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority ('ADIA'), and several other large global institutions. Under the terms of the transaction, funds affiliated with MOP will increase their shareholding in the Group and HPS will reinvest in the Group. Co-investors, including a wholly owned subsidiary of ADIA and several other large global institutions, will also acquire more than USO 1 billion equity through accounts managed by MOP and HPS as part of the transaction, which values Ardonagh at USO 7.5 billion. Subject to regulatory approvals being obtained, the new equity investment will result in the Company merging into a newly created company Tara Topco Limited ('Tara') following which the Ardonagh Group activities will be overseen by a newly created subsidiary of Tara called Ardonagh Group Holdings Limited. As a result of Russia invading Ukraine, we have seen significant new sanctions legislation from a range of legislators (including the US, EU and UK), with newly sanctioned entities and individuals, and new (or wider in scope) sectoral sanctions targeting Russia (and Belarus). The Ardonagh Group has no appetite for potential breaches of applicable sanctions regimes. Most of the Group's inherent risk exposure relates to international 'London Market' insurance business within Ardonagh Specialty. Our robust framework and sophisticated control environment, which includes enhanced due diligence on Russian-linked business (prior to accepting the client relationships) and automated daily screening of all existing clients against relevant sanctions lists are dynamically updated as they change. The Group has also reviewed its defences against cyber risks in the context of anticipated increases in such threats to Western companies from Russia and has reviewed its procurement processes and supplier relationships for Russian links. Our mandatory due diligence on potential acquisitions also includes pre-completion screening of full client and supplier lists. We continue to actively monitor the situation as it develops and will respond accordingly as new sanctions are enacted. -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,879

1923_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,3301,B,3301.1,7.1. Identification and scoping of components,3301.1.1,,"Our group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the group and its environment, including group-wide controls, and assessing the risks of material misstatement at the group level. Given the number of components and operating locations within the group, we assessed the extent of audit work required to be performed to give appropriate coverage for the purposes of the group financial statement audit. Our approach considered revenue contribution to the group result as primary measure of financial significance and scope, and cash as a secondary balance sheet measure given the significance of the cash balance to the operational activities of wider group. Coverage obtained on this basis was 82% (2020: 92%) of Revenue and 84% of cash (2020: 90% of group total assets). Of the group's 18 significant components, 9 were subjected to full scope audits of the financial information of the component and 9 subjected to an audit of one or more account balances, classes of transactions or disclosures. Those subjected to an audit of one or more account balances, classes of transactions or disclosures are not individually financially significant enough to require full scope audit of the financial information of the component for group purposes, but did present specific areas of risk which needed to be addressed. At the group level we also tested the consolidation process and carried out analytical procedures to confirm our conclusion that there were no significant risks of material misstatement of the aggregated financial information of the remaining components not subject to a full audit. a Full audit scope a Full audit scope - Specified audit procedures    - Specified audit procedures a Review at group level a Review at group level",N/A,as_expected,2024,879

Working with other auditors,3301.2.1,,"Work on two components, Arachas Corporate Brokers (Ireland) and Resilium (Australia), were undertaken by Deloitte overseas component audit teams. Work on a single component Ed Broking and Besso Insurance (""Ed Besso"") is performed by a different audit firm, EV. We directed and supervised the component teams in the performance of their work through providing detailed instructions setting out the work to be performed, having regular conference calls with the team throughout the audit and by performing a review of their audit working papers over a video conference. 8. Other information The other information comprises the information included in the annual report, other than the financial statements and our auditor's report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information contained within the annual report. a Full audit scope a Full audit scope - Specified audit procedures   - Specified audit procedures a Review at group level a Review at group level ----- Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether this gives rise to a material misstatement in the financial statements themselves. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. 9. Responsibilities of directors As explained more fully in the directors' responsibilities statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as th_e directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group's and the parent company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so. 10. Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the FRC's website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor's report. 11. Extent to which the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below.",N/A,as_expected,2024,879

Identifying and assessing potential risks related to irregularities,3301.3.1,,"In identifying and assessing risks of material misstatement in respect of irregularities, including fraud and non-compliance with laws and regulations, we considered the following: - the nature of the industry and sector, control environment and business performance including the design of the group's remuneration policies, key drivers for directors' remuneration, bonus levels and performance targets; - results of our enquiries of management, internal audit and the audit committee about their own identification and assessment of the risks of irregularities; - any matters we identified having obtained and reviewed the group's documentation of their policies and procedures relating to: o identifying, evaluating and complying with laws and regulations and whether they were aware of any instances of non-compliance; conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. 9. Responsibilities of directors ----- o detecting and responding to the risks of fraud and whether they have knowledge of any actual, suspected or alleged fraud; o the internal controls established to mitigate risks of fraud or non-compliance with laws and regulations; - the matters discussed among the audit engagement team including significant component audit teams and relevant internal specialists, including tax, valuations, IT, and industry specialists regarding how and where fraud might occur in the financial statements and any potential indicators of fraud. As a result of these procedures, we considered the opportunities and incentives that may exist within the organisation for fraud and identified the greatest potential for fraud in the following areas: Goodwill impairment, Acquisition accounting, Presentation of APMs, and Revenue recognition. In common with all audits under ISAs (UK), we are also required to perform specific procedures to respond to the risk of management override. We also obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory framework that the group operates in, focusing on provisions of those laws and regulations that had a direct effect on the determination of material amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The key laws and regulations we considered in this context included the UK Companies Act. In addition, we considered provisions of other laws and regulations that do not have a direct effect on the financial statements but compliance with which may be fundamental to the group's ability to operate or to avoid a material penalty. These included the group's FCA permissions and compliance with FCA client assets regulations.",N/A,as_expected,2024,879

The key audit matters section of our report explains the matters in more detail and also describes the specific procedures we performed in response to those key audit matters. In addition to the above, our procedures to respond to risks identified included the following: - reviewing the financial statement disclosures and testing to supporting documentation to assess compliance with provisions of relevant laws and regulations described as having a direct effect on the financial statements; - enquiring of management, the audit committee and in-house legal counsel concerning actual and potential litigation and claims; - performing analytical procedures to identify any unusual or unexpected relationships that may indicate risks of material misstatement due to fraud; - reading minutes of meetings of those charged with governance, reviewing internal audit reports and reviewing correspondence with the FCA; - in addressing the risk of fraud through management override of controls, testing the appropriateness of journal entries and other adjustments; assessing whether the judgements made in making accounting estimates are indicative of a potential bias; and evaluating the business rationale of any significant transactions that are unusual or outside the normal course of business. We also communicated relevant identified laws and regulations and potential fraud risks to all engagement team members including internal specialists and significant component audit teams, and remained alert to any indications of fraud or non­ compliance with laws and regulations throughout the audit.

1923_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,3301,B,3301.27,NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2** **Basis of preparation,3301.27.1,,"The consolidated financial statements comprise the Company ancl its subsidiaries (the Group) and have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the United Kingdom (UK-adopted IFRS) and the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The consolidated financial statements are presented in GBP (£). Amounts shown are rounded to the nearest thousand, unless stated otherwise. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified to use a different measurement basis where necessary to comply with IFRS. The Directors have considered the guida nee of the UK Financial Reporting Council and events relating to the spread of coronavirus (Covid-19) in preparing these financial statements. Going concern At 31 December 2021, the Group had net assets of £83.8m (31 December 2020 net liabilities: £141.4m) and net current assets of £368.2m (31 December 2020: £159.0m). The Group reported an operating profit of £102.8m for the year ended 31 December 2021 {31 December 2020: £54.lm), net cash inflows from operating activities of £688.Sm (31 December 2020: £152.8m), cash inflows of £754.lm {31 December 2020: £177.lm) and operating cash conversion of 96% {31 December 2020: 97%). Available cash of £411.3m was reported on 31 December 2021 {31 December 2020: £154.Sm). The Directors have assessed the Group's financial position and its ability to meet its obligations as and when they fall due. In making the going concern assessment the Directors have taken into account the following: - The Group's capital structure, operations and liquidity following the 14 July 2020 issuance of new borrowings; £343.0m received for the 350,000 preference shares issued on 3 September 2021; and the additional 19 August 2021 Capex, Acquisition and Re-organisation facility (CAR upsize) of circa £565.0m agreed with the lenders of the Group's privately placed term loan facility due 2026 (see Business Review: Liquidity and Capital Resources), of which £164.3m remains undrawn at the date of this report. These are reflected in the adjusted base case and stressed cash flow forecasts over the calendar years 2022 and 2023. - The impact on the base case cashflow forecasts arising from material acquisitions since the finalisation of the Group's base case budget. - The principal risks facing the Group, including global political tensions (including related to the Ukrainian conflict) and potential residual financial impacts of Covid-19 following lockdown restrictions being removed in the UK, and its systems of risk management and internal control. - Actual trading and cashflows that arose in the two months ended February 2022, with continued positive financial results. ----- ###### FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Key assumptions that the Directors have made in preparing the base case cash flow forecasts are that: - Following the 14 July 2020 issuance of new borrowings, which the Group used to repay its existing borrowings and to fund acquisitions: (a) the Group will continue to benefit from a £191.Sm Revolving Credit Facility that is not drawn at the date of this report, and (b) payment-in-kind interest options are utilised. - Client retention and renewal rates continue to be robust, despite the current economic uncertainty, as the 2021 trading performance continues to demonstrate resilience across the Group. Key stress scenarios that the Directors have considered include cumulative stresses to the base plan as a result of: - Shortfalls in base case projected income throughout 2022 and 2023. - Deterioration in base case cash conversion rates over and above the shortfalls in income. - Mitigating actions within management control including delayed capital expenditure, a reduction in discretionary spend and some reduction in employee headcount and remuneration. The Directors have also modelled reverse stress scenarios, including assessing those that result in a default on our term debt facilities that would require a technical repayment obligation and those that would exhaust available liquidity. The stresses needed for these outcomes to happen significantly exceed the key stress scenarios above and the Directors consider such conditions to be a remote possibility. Other mitigations which may be possible in the stress scenarios but have not been included in the analysis include seeking shareholder support, securitising premium receivables and further incremental and more prolonged cost reductions. The Directors continue to consider the wider operational consequences and ramifications of global political tensions (including related to the Ukrainian conflict) and residual impacts from the Covid-19 pandemic. In particular: - The Group has demonstrated the efficiency and stability of the Group's infrastructure and the ability for home working for a significant portion of our employee base. - Insurance broking is a resilient and defensive market, which has historically had limited impact from past economic or capital market downturns. The Group is highly diversified and not materially exposed to a single carrier, customer or market sector. - Although Covid-19 developments remain fluid, the stress testing demonstrates the Group's financial resilience and operating flexibility. Following the assessment of the Group's financial position and its ability to meet its obligations as and when they fall due, including the further potential financial implications of economic uncertainty included in stress tests, and the wider operational consequences and ramifications of the pandemic, the Directors are not aware of any material uncertainties that cast significant doubt on the businesses of the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. ----- ###### FINANCIAL STATEMENTS",N/A,as_expected,2024,879

1923_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,3301,B,3301.30,(al • Basis of consolidation,3301.30.1,,"The Group consolidates those investees that it is deemed to control, referred to as subsidiaries. The Group has control over an investee if all three of the following are met: (i) it has power over the investee, (ii) it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the investee, and (iii) it has ability to use its power over the investee to affect the amount of its own returns. The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether the Group controls another entity. Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. The assets, liabilities, profits and losses of the subsidiary are added line by line to those of the Group. lntercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains and losses on transactions between Group companies are eliminated. Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group. _Accounting for business combinations_ The Group uses the acquisition method of accounting to account for business combinations. The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair value of the assets transferred, the liabilities assumed and the equity interests issued by the Group. The consideration transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement. Identifiable assets acquired, and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed, in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. The Group recognises any non-controlling interest in the acquiree at the non-controlling interest's proportionate share of the acquiree's net assets. Acquisition-related costs, except costs to issue debt or equity securities, are expensed as incurred. If a business combination is achieved in stages, the acquirer's previously held equity interest in the acquiree is re-measured to fair value at the acquisition date through profit or loss. Some acquisitions involve a put and/or call option. A put option gives the seller the right to require the Group to acquire its shareholdings in the acquiree at a future date. A call option gives the Group the right to require the seller to sell its shareholdings in the acquiree to the Group. The put and/or call options are usually exercisable within specified time periods. The exercise price of the options is usually based on a multiple of EBITDA, net of the net debt of the acquiree for the financial year that immediately precedes the financial year in which the option is exercised. The Group recognises a financial liability where there is a put option, at an amount corresponding to the present value of the option price {the redemption amount), and that liability is classified as 'Share buyout' in the financial statements. Subsequent changes to the fair value of deferred consideration, contingent consideration or the share buyout balance are recognised in accordance with IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments' in profit or loss, unless the changes occur during the 'measurement period' of up to one year following the acquisition date and are the result of additional information that the acquirer has obtained after the acquisition date about facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date. Contingent consideration that is classified as equity is not re-measured, and its subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity. ----- ###### FINANCIAL STATEMENTS",N/A,as_expected,2024,879
1923_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,3301,B,3301.31,NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 3** **Accounting policies (continued},3301.31.1,,"_Disposal of subsidiaries_ Where the Group disposes of its controlling interest in a subsidiary, the assets and liabilities are derecognised along with any related non-controlling interest and other components of equity. Any resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss. Any interest retained in the former subsidiary is measured at fair value when control is lost. _Goodwill_ Goodwill is initially measured as the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred and of the non-controlling interest over the fair value of the net of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If goodwill is negative (i.e. a shortfall instead of an excess), it is recognised in profit or loss. Goodwill acquired in the period represents expected synergies from combining operations of the acquiree and the Group, and intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment and is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold. Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units for the purposes of impairment testing. _Transactions with non-controlling interests_ Transactions with non-controlling interests that do not result in the loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions. (bl **Investments in associates and joint ventures _Associates_ An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence and that is neither a subsidiary nor an interest in a joint arrangement. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control nor joint control over those policies. The results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in the consolidated financial statements as a single line in each of the statement of financial position and the statement of profit or loss using the equity method of accounting. The consolidated statement of financial position therefore includes investment in associates measured at cost as adjusted for post-acquisition changes in the Group's economic share of the net assets of the associate, less any impairment in the value of the investment, but the carrying amount cannot fall below zero. The consolidated income statement includes a share of the profit or loss of the associate. _Joint arrangements_ The Group applies IFRS 11 'Joint Arrangements' to all joint arrangements. Investments in joint arrangements are, as required by IFRS 11, classified as either joint operations or joint ventures, depending on the contractual rights and obligations of each investor. The Group has assessed the nature of its joint arrangements and has determined them to be joint ventures. Joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method, in a similar manner to associates. ----- ###### FINANCIAL STATEMENTS",N/A,as_expected,2024,879
1923_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,3301,B,3301.32,NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 3** **Accounting policies (continued) (cl Intangible assets,3301.32.1,,"_Customer relationships_ Customer relationship intangible assets are recognised on a business combination because the acquirer is able to benefit from selling future new business through existing relationships. Their fair value is calculated as the sum of the present value of projected cash flows in excess of returns on contributory assets over the life of the relationship with the customers. These assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of between 5 and 10 years, which is estimated by reference to the history of the relationships and levels of attrition. _Distribution network_ Distribution network intangible assets are recognised on a business combination because the acquirer is able to benefit from already established distribution channels. Their fair value is calculated as the sum of the present value of projected future cash flows generated by existing distribution channels. These assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of 10 years, which is estimated by reference to the history of the relationships and levels of attrition. _Brond_ Brand intangible assets are recognised on a business combination because they are separable or arise from contractual or other legal rights. Their fair value is calculated as the sum of the present value of projected royalty payments that would be paid to licence the right to use the brand. These assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over. their estimated useful lives of between 1 and 10 years, which considers the Group's track record of retaining brands and experience of the insurance broking market. _Computer software_ Computer software is recognised when purchased separately, when acquired as part of a business combination, or when internally-generated. The fair value of computer software that is purchased separately is calculated by reference to the amount paid. The fair value of computer software that is acquired as part of a business combination is calculated using the depreciated replacement cost or relief from royalty approach. The fair value of internally-generated computer software is calculated as described below. These assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life of 4 years. _lnternally-qeneroted computer software and assets under construction (unless acquired on a business combination/_ Expenditure on research activities is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred. An internally-generated intangible asset arising from the development of computer software is recognised if, and only if, all the following conditions have been demonstrated: - the technical feasibility of completing the asset so that it will be available for use or sale; - the intention to complete the asset and to use or sell it; - the ability to use or sell the asset; - how the asset will generate future economic benefits; - the availability of adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the asset; and - the ability to measure reliably the expenditure attributable to the asset during its development. The amount initially recognised is the sum of the expenditure incurred from the date when the intangible asset first meets the recognition criteria listed above and is classified as an asset under construction. Where no internally-generated intangible asset can be recognised, development expenditure is recognised in profit or loss in the period in which it is incurred. Internally-generated intangible assets are not amortised in the period subsequent to initial recognition but before they are ready for use. Amortisation commences when they are ready for use as intended by management. They are then reported at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, on the same basis as intangible assets that are acquired separately. Internally-generated intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life of 4 years. ----- ###### FINANCIAL STATEMENTS",N/A,as_expected,2024,879
1923_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,3301,B,3301.33,NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 3** **Accounting policies (continued),3301.33.1,,"_Intellectual property_ Intellectual property assets include a bespoke database and online platform. These assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life of 4 years. _Derecoqnition ofintanqible assets_ An intangible asset is derecognised on disposal, or when no future economic benefits are expected from use or disposal. Gains or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset, measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset, are recognised in profit or loss when the asset is derecognised. _Impairment of assets_ Intangible assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment. Assets that are subject to amortisation or depreciation are reviewed for impairment at each statement of financial position date or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset's carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. If it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the recoverable amount of the 'cash generating unit' to which the asset belongs is determined, being the lowest level for which there are separately identifiable cash flows. Any impairment charges arising from the review of the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets are, where material, disclosed separately on the face of the consolidated income statement. _Financial assets classified as amortised cost_ Financial assets that meet the following conditions are classified and subsequently measured at amortised cost: - the financial asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows; and o the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. The amortised cost of a financial asset is the amount at which the financial asset is measured at initial recognition minus the principal repayments, plus the cumulative amortisation using the effective interest method of any difference between that initial amount and the maturity amount, adjusted for any loss allowance. The Group's financial assets measured at amortised cost include trade and other receivables (except for certain other receivables measured at FVTPL, see below), advances to related parties, cash and cash equivalents and certain other financial assets. The Group's trade receivables do not generally have a significant financing component, so their transaction (invoiced) price is considered to be their amortised cost. Insurance brokers act as agents in placing the insurable risks of their clients with insurers and, as such, are not usually liable as principal for amounts arising from such transactions. In recognition of this relationship, debtors from insurance broking transactions are not, in general, included as an asset of the Group. Other than the receivable for fees and commissions earned on a transaction, recognition of the insurance transaction does not, in general, occur until the Group receives cash in respect of premiums or claims, at which time a corresponding liability is established in favour of the insurer or the client. An exception exists in relation to funded premium and claim items whereby the Group has a legal obligation to make good any shortfall to client monies in the event of default. In certain circumstances, the Group advances premiums, refunds or claims to insurers or clients prior to collection. These advances are reflected in the consolidated statement of financial position as part of trade receivables. _Financial assets classified as FVTOCI_ Financial assets are classified and subsequently measured at FVTOCI if they meet the criteria to be classified at amortised cost except that the business model is to sell financial assets as well as to hold financial assets to collect contractual cash flows. The Group may also irrevocably elect to classify and subsequently measure equity investments at FVTOCI. Gains and losses on these equity instruments are never recycled to profit or loss. Dividend income from equity instruments measured at FVTOCI is recognised in profit or loss as part of investment income when the right to payment has been established (provided that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and that the amount of income can be measured reliably), except when the Group benefits from such proceeds as a recovery of part of the cost of the instrument, in which case, such gains are recorded in other comprehensive income. The right to payment is established on the ex-dividend date for listed equity securities, and usually on the date when shareholders approve the dividend for unlisted equity securities. Equity instruments at FVTOCI are not subject to an impairment assessment. The Group has designated all of its unlisted equity investments as at FVTOCI, because these investments were on initial recognition held as long-term strategic investments that are not expected to be sold in the short to medium term. ----- ###### FINANCIAL STATEMENTS _Financial assets classified as FVTPL_ Financial assets that do not meet the criteria for being measured at amortised cost or FVTOCI are measured at FVTPL. Specifically: - Investments in equity instruments are classified as FVTPL, unless the Group designates an equity investment as FVTOCI on initial recognition. - Debt instruments (including receivables) that do not meet the amortised cost criteria or the FVTOCI criteria are classified as FVTPL. Financial assets classified as FVTPL are recorded in the statement of financial position at fair value. Changes in fair value are recorded in profit and loss to the extent they are not part of a designated hedging relationship. The Group's Unregulated Collective Investment Scheme (UCIS) assets are classified as FVTPL. These assets do not meet the IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments' criteria for classification as amortised cost or FVTOCI, because their cashflows do not represent solely payments of principal and interest. The Group has not designated any debt investments that meet the amortised cost or FVTOCI criteria as being measured at FVTPL. Other financial assets measured at FVTPL include convertible loan receivables, and receivables recognised on a business combination in relation to the Group's right to variable consideration on rolling contracts with customers for which the performance obligation was satisfied prior to the acquisition. These financial assets are not classified as amortised cost or FVTOCI because their cash flows do not represent solely payments of principal and interest. Foreign exchange gains and losses The carrying amount of financial assets that are denominated in a foreign currency is determined in that foreign currency and translated at the spot rate at the end of each reporting period. Specifically: - for equity instruments measured at FVTOCI, exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income; and - for all other financial assets that are not part of a designated hedging relationship, exchange differences are recognised in profit or loss in the other operating costs line item. Reclassifications Financial assets are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition. They would only be reclassified if the Group were to change its business model for managing its financial assets, in which case the affected financial assets would be reclassified following that change. Impairment of financial assets The Group assesses, on a forward-looking basis, the expected credit losses (""ECL"") associated with its financial assets carried at amortised cost. The Group recognises a loss allowance for such losses at each reporting date. The Group recognises lifetime ECL for trade and other receivables. The expected credit losses on these financial assets are estimated using a provision matrix based on the Group's historical credit loss experience, adjusted for factors that are specific to the debtors and by scalar factors to reflect differences between economic conditions during the period over which the historical data was collected versus current conditions and the Group's view of economic conditions over the expected lives of the receivables, including the time value of money where appropriate. Scalar factors are typically based on GDP and unemployment rate forecasts. For all other financial instruments, the Group recognises lifetime ECL when there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition. If, on the other hand, the credit risk on the financial instrument has not increased significantly since initial recognition, the Group measures the loss allowance for that financial instrument at an amount equal to 12 months ECL.",N/A,as_expected,2024,879

Depreciation is calculated to write off the cost of such assets on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. At the reporting date, the Group's principal rates of depreciation were as follows: Freehold buildings - over 50 years (except integral features which are over 20 years) Leasehold improvements - over the remaining life of the lease Furniture and equipment - over 4 years Computer equipment - over 4 years Fixtures and fittings - over 4 years Motor vehicles - over 4 years The assets' residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each reporting period. Property, plant and equipment is derecognised on disposal, or when no future economic benefits are expected from use or disposal. Gains or losses arising from derecognition of property, plant and equipment, measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset, are recognised in profit or loss when the asset is derecognised. ----- ###### FINANCIAL STATEMENTS",N/A,as_expected,2024,879
1923_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,3301,B,3301.35,NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 3** **Accounting policies (continued) (el Leases,3301.35.1,,"The Group accounts for lease and non-lease components in a contract as a single lease component. Right-of-use assets The Group recognises right-of-use assets at the commencement date of the lease (i.e. the date the underlying asset is available for use). Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and are adjusted for certain remeasurement_s of the lease liabilities. The cost of right-of-use assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognised, initial direct costs incurred, lease payments made at or before the commencement date of the lease less any lease incentives received, plus the estimated costs of restoring the underlying asset to the condition required by the terms of the lease. Unless the Group is reasonably certain to obtain ownership of the leased asset at the end of the lease term, the recognised right­ of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the estimated useful life and the lease term. Right-of­ use assets are subject to impairment. Lease liabilities· At the commencement date of the lease, the Group recognises lease liabilities measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term. The lease payments include fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments) less any lease incentives receivable, variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, and amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees. The lease payments also include the exercise price of a purchase option reasonably certain to be exercised by the Group and payments of penalties for terminating a lease if the lease term reflects the Group exercising the option to terminate. The variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognised as an expense in the period on which the event or condition that triggers the payment occurs. In calculating the present value of lease payments, the Group uses the incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date if the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable, which is generally the case. After the commencement date, the amount of lease liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of interest and it is reduced for the lease payments made. In addition, the carrying amount of lease liabilities is remeasured if there is a modification, a change in the lease term, a change in the in-substance fixed lease payments or a change in the assessment to purchase the underlying asset. Leases of low value assets The Group elects on a lease-by-lease basis whether to apply the lease of low-value assets exemption to non-property leases that are considered to be of low value (i.e. below £5,000). Where the exemption is applied, lease payments on leases of low-value assets are recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Subleases The Group does not undertake arrangements as a lessor other than as a sublessor. When the Group is a sublessor, it classifies the sublease as a finance lease if the sublease transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the asset that is the subject of the sublease, namely the right-of-use asset arising from the head lease. The sublease is otherwise classified as an operating lease. ----- ###### FINANCIAL STATEMENTS",N/A,as_expected,2024,879
1923_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,3301,B,3301.36,NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 3** **Accounting policies (continued) (fl Financial instruments,3301.36.1,,"Recognition and initial measurement Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the financial instrument, and they are measured initially at fair value. Transaction costs arising on the issue of a financial asset or financial liability are accounted for as follows: - Transaction costs are added to or deducted from the fair value of the financial asset or financial liability if they are directly attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset or financial liability, respectively, and if the financial asset is measured at fair value through other comprehensive income or if the financial asset or financial liability, respectively, is measured at amortised cost. - Transaction costs are recognised immediately in profit or loss if they are directly attributable to the issue of a financial asset or financial liability at fair value through profit or loss, or if they are not directly attributable to the issue of a financial asset or financial liability. Derecognition Financial assets are derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire, or the Group transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred. On derecognition of a financial asset measured at amortised cost, the difference between the asset's carrying amount and the sum of the consideration received and receivable is recognised in profit or loss. On derecognition of an investment in an equity instrument which the Group has elected on initial recognition to measure at fair value through other comprehensive income, the cumulative gain or loss previously accumulated in equity is not reclassified to profit or loss but is included in retained earnings. A financial liability is derecognised when it is extinguished, discharged, cancelled or expires. The difference between the carrying value of the financial liability and the consideration paid and payable, including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed, is recognised in profit or loss. Where an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability. Offsetting Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset, and the net amount presented in the statement of financial position when, and only when, the Group currently has a legally enforceable right to set off the amounts and it intends either to settle them on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. Classification and subsequent measurement of financial assets The Group classifies its financial assets in the following measurement categories: - Amortised cost; - Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI); or - Fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL). All recognised financial assets are subsequently measured in their entirety at either amortised cost or fair value, depending on their classification. ----- ###### FINANCIAL STATEMENTS",N/A,as_expected,2024,879
