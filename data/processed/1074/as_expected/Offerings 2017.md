#### e545,000,000 % Senior Notes due 2025

Diamond (BC) B.V. (the ‘‘Issuer’’), a newly-formed private limited liability company (besloten vennootschap met beperkte aansprakelijkheid)
incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands and controlled by affiliates of Bain Capital (as defined herein), is offering e545,000,000 aggregate
principal amount of % Senior Notes due 2025 (the ‘‘notes’’). The notes will mature on, 2025. Interest on the notes will be paid
semi-annually in arrears on and of each year, commencing on, 2018.


This offering is being made in connection with and as part of the proposed financing for the Issuer’s proposed acquisition (the ‘‘Acquisition’’)
of Diversey (as defined herein). Upon release from escrow as described below, we intend to use the proceeds of this offering, together with an equity
contribution from our principal shareholders and borrowings under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities (as defined herein), to (i) finance the
Acquisition and (ii) pay fees and expenses in connection with the Transactions (as defined herein). See ‘‘Summary—The Transactions’’.

The Issuer may redeem the notes, in whole or in part, at any time prior to, 2020, at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of
the notes redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date, plus a ‘‘make-whole’’ premium, as described in
this offering circular. The Issuer may also redeem the notes, in whole or in part, at any time on or after, 2020, at the applicable redemption
prices set forth under ‘‘Description of Notes—Optional Redemption’’, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date.
In addition, the Issuer may redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes at any time prior to, 2020 using the net cash
proceeds from certain equity offerings at the redemption price specified under ‘‘Description of Notes—Optional Redemption’’, plus accrued and
unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. See ‘‘Description of Notes—Optional Redemption’’. Upon the occurrence of certain
events constituting a change of control, the Issuer will be required to make an offer to repurchase all of the notes at a price equal to 101% of the
principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the repurchase date.

Prior to the Escrow Release Date (as defined below), the notes will be obligations solely of the Issuer and will not be guaranteed but will be
secured by a first priority lien on the escrow account and the funds held therein for the benefit of the holders of the notes. From and after the Escrow
Release Date, the notes will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed (the ‘‘guarantees’’), jointly and severally, on a senior unsecured basis by BCPE
Diamond Netherlands TopCo B.V., a private limited liability company (besloten vennootschap met beperkte aansprakelijkheid) incorporated under the
laws of the Netherlands, and the Issuer’s direct parent (‘‘Holdings’’), and the Issuer’s existing and subsequently acquired or organized direct or
indirect material wholly-owned restricted subsidiaries that guarantee indebtedness under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities except as set forth herein
(collectively with Holdings, the ‘‘guarantors’’).

The notes will be the Issuer’s and, from and after the Escrow Release Date, the guarantees will be each guarantor’s general senior unsecured
obligations and will rank equally in right of payment with all of the Issuer’s and each guarantor’s existing and future senior indebtedness, respectively.
The notes and the guarantees will rank senior in right of payment to all of the Issuer’s and each guarantor’s existing and future indebtedness and
other obligations that expressly provide for their subordination to the notes or the guarantees. The notes and the guarantees will be effectively
subordinated to all of the Issuer’s and each guarantor’s existing and future secured indebtedness, including obligations under our Senior Secured
Credit Facilities, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. The notes and the guarantees will also be structurally
subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness, claims of holders of preferred stock and other liabilities of any of our existing and future
subsidiaries that do not guarantee the notes. See ‘‘Description of Notes’’ and ‘‘Description of Certain Other Indebtedness’’.

Upon the consummation of this offering, the Issuer will deposit (or cause to be deposited) the gross proceeds from the offering of the notes
into a segregated escrow account in the name of the Escrow Agent (as defined herein) for the benefit of the trustee and the holders of the notes. The
release of the escrowed funds will be subject to satisfaction of the Escrow Release Conditions (as defined herein), including the consummation of the
Acquisition. If the Acquisition is not consummated on or prior to October 16, 2017 (as such date may be extended in accordance with the terms and
conditions of the escrow agreement) (such date, as extended, the ‘‘Outside Date’’), or upon the occurrence of certain other events, the notes will be
subject to a special mandatory redemption at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest and
additional amounts, if any, from the issue date to, but excluding, the redemption date. See ‘‘Description of notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special
Mandatory Redemption’’.

There is currently no market for the notes. An application has been made to The International Stock Exchange Authority Limited (the
‘‘Authority’’) for the listing of and permission to deal in the notes on the Official List of The International Stock Exchange (the ‘‘Exchange’’). There is
no assurance that the notes will be listed on the Official List of the Exchange, that such permission to deal in the notes will be granted or that such
listing will be maintained. The consummation of this offering is not contingent upon obtaining this listing. We cannot assure you that an active trading
market for the notes will develop.

_Investing in the notes involves risks. See ‘‘Risk Factors’’ beginning on page 29 for a discussion of certain risks that you should consider in_
_connection with an investment in the notes._


**Offering Price:** **%**

The offering price set forth herein above does not include accrued interest, if any. Interest on the notes will accrue from, 2017. If the
notes are delivered after, 2017, accrued interest must be paid by the purchaser until the time of delivery.

The notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the ‘‘Securities Act’’), or the securities laws
of any other jurisdiction. The Issuer and the initial purchasers named below are selling the notes only to persons reasonably believed to be qualified
institutional buyers under Rule 144A under the Securities Act and offering and selling to certain non-U.S. persons outside the United States under
Regulation S of the Securities Act and, if such investors are residents of a member state of the European Economic Area (the ‘‘EEA’’), only to
qualified investors. For further details about eligible offerees and resale restrictions, see ‘‘Transfer Restrictions’’.


The notes will be issued in denominations of e100,000 and in integral multiples of e1,000 in excess thereof.

The initial purchasers expect to deliver the notes to investors on or about, 2017 only in book-entry form through the facilities of
Euroclear Bank SA/NV, as operator of the Euroclear System (‘‘Euroclear’’) and Clearstream Banking, soci´et´e anonyme (‘‘Clearstream’’).

**PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION**

All references in this offering circular to ‘‘euro’’ and ‘‘e’’ refer to the lawful currency of the EU
Member States participating in the European Monetary Union, and all references to ‘‘U.S. dollars’’
and ‘‘$’’ refer to the currency of the United States of America.

**Historical Financial Statements**

This offering circular contains the audited combined financial statements of Diversey as of
December 31, 2016 and 2015 and for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the
unaudited condensed combined financial statements of Diversey as of March 31, 2017 and for three
months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016.

The historical financial statements included in this offering circular do not include a footnote
showing consolidating financial information for the Issuer, the guarantors and the non-guarantors of
the notes offered hereby as would be required if we were registering the notes with the SEC. We
have, however, included the percentage of our consolidated net sales and Adjusted EBITDA (as
defined herein) that the Diversey subsidiaries that will not guarantee the notes represented for the
twelve months ended March 31, 2017, and the percentage of our total consolidated assets that
those non-guarantor subsidiaries represented as of March 31, 2017.

**Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information**

This offering circular contains unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information,
which have been derived the historical financial statements of Diversey appearing elsewhere in this
offering circular. The assumptions underlying the pro forma adjustments are described in the notes
accompanying the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements, which should
be read together.

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet data gives effect to the
Transactions as if they had occurred on March 31, 2017. The unaudited pro forma condensed
combined statement of operations data for the twelve months ended March 31, 2017 has been
derived by adding the historical combined statement of operations data for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2016 to the historical combined statement of operations data for the three months
ended March 31, 2017, subtracting the historical combined statement of operations data for the
three months ended March 31, 2016 and applying the pro forma adjustments to give effect to the
Transactions as if they had occurred on January 1, 2016. We describe the assumptions underlying
the pro forma adjustments in the notes accompanying the unaudited pro forma condensed
combined financial statements, which should be read in conjunction with the unaudited pro forma

v


-----

condensed combined financial statements. We operated as a business unit/division of Sealed Air
and not as a stand-alone entity for each of the historical financial periods used in the preparation of
the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements. Following the completion of the
Transactions, we expect to be able to perform certain back-office functions and other services with
respect to our international operations previously provided to us by Sealed Air on a more
cost-effective basis than the amounts that have been allocated to us in each of these historical
financial periods. We have not made any adjustments in the unaudited pro forma condensed
combined financial statements to reflect any of these expected cost-savings as these types of
adjustments may not be permitted under the SEC’s rules and regulations regarding the preparation
of pro forma financial statements included in a registration statement filed under the Securities Act.

The pro forma adjustments related to the business combination accounting and financing of
the Transactions are preliminary and based on information obtained to date and are subject to
revision as additional information becomes available. The business combination accounting rules,
as described in the notes accompanying the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial
statements, require us to record the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their fair
value as of the closing date of the Transactions and may differ from those reflected in the unaudited
pro forma condensed combined financial statements. Revisions to the preliminary business
combination accounting and financing of the Transactions may have a significant impact on the pro
forma amounts of total assets, total liabilities and stockholder’s equity, general and administrative
expenses, depreciation and amortization, interest expense and income taxes.

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements should not be considered
indicative of actual results that would have been achieved had the Transactions been consummated
on the date or for the periods indicated and do not purport to indicate consolidated balance sheet
data or results of operations data as of any future date or for any future period.

**NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES**

We believe that the financial statements included in this offering circular have been prepared
in a manner that complies, in all material respects, with generally accepted accounting principles in
the United States (‘‘GAAP’’), and the regulations published by the SEC, and are consistent with
current practice with the exception of the presentation of certain non-GAAP financial measures,
including EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Further Adjusted EBITDA, the inclusion of financial data for
the twelve months ended March 31, 2017, including pro forma financial data, and the omission of
certain financial information regarding the guarantor and non-guarantor subsidiaries.

EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Further Adjusted EBITDA as presented in this offering circular
are supplemental measures that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, GAAP.
EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Further Adjusted EBITDA are not measures of our financial
performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to revenues, net income,
income before income tax provision or any other performance measures derived in accordance with
GAAP, nor should they be considered as alternatives to cash flows from operating activities as a
measure of liquidity in accordance with GAAP. In addition, our method of calculating EBITDA,
Adjusted EBITDA and Further Adjusted EBITDA may vary from the methods used by other
companies.

Our management considers EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Further Adjusted EBITDA to be key
indicators of our financial performance. Additionally, we believe EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and
Further Adjusted EBITDA are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested
parties in the evaluation of companies in our industry. We also believe that investors, analysts and
rating agencies consider EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Further Adjusted EBITDA useful means of
measuring our ability to meet our debt service obligations and evaluating our financial performance,

vi


-----

and management uses these measures for one or more of these purposes. Our presentation of
EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Further Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference
that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items. EBITDA, Adjusted
EBITDA and Further Adjusted EBITDA have important limitations as analytical tools and you should
not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP.
The use of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Further Adjusted EBITDA instead of net income has
limitations as an analytical tool, including the following:

   - EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Further Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect changes in, or cash
requirements for, our working capital needs;

   - EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Further Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect our interest expense,
or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our debt;

   - EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Further Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect our tax expense or
the cash requirements to pay our taxes;

   - although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated
and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA
and Further Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements;

   - EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Further Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect historical cash
expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;
and

   - other companies in our industry may calculate these measures differently than we do,
limiting their usefulness as a comparative measure.

Adjusted EBITDA and Further Adjusted EBITDA include adjustments that represented a cash
expense or that represented a non-cash charge that may relate to a future cash expense, and some
of these expenses are of a type that we expect to incur in the future, although we cannot predict
the amount of any such future charge.

Because of these limitations, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Further Adjusted EBITDA should
not be considered as a replacement for net income or as a measure of discretionary cash available
to us to service our indebtedness or invest in our business. We compensate for these limitations by
relying primarily on our GAAP results and using EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Further Adjusted
EBITDA only for supplemental purposes.

For the definition of and additional information about our EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and

**Company Overview**

We are a leading global provider of high-performance cleaning, sanitation and hygiene
products for the food safety and service, food and beverage plant operations, healthcare, floor care,
housekeeping and room care, laundry and hand care markets. In addition, we offer a wide range of
value-added services, including food safety and application training and consulting, as well as
auditing of hygiene and water management. We serve institutional and industrial end-users such as
food service providers, lodging establishments, food and beverage processing plants, building
service contractors, building managers and property owners, retail outlets, schools and healthcare
facilities globally. We trace our history back to 1886 and since then have predominantly operated
within larger, diversified, product-driven manufacturing companies including Molson, Unilever PLC
(‘‘Unilever’’), S.C. Johnson & Son, Inc. (‘‘SCJ’’) and most recently, Sealed Air. Although our
cleaning products represent only a small portion of our customers’ total cleaning costs, they are
typically viewed as being non-discretionary given they can have a meaningful impact on the efficacy
of cleaning solutions and operational costs.

Our fully integrated suite of solutions combine chemicals, dispensing equipment, cleaning
machines, services and digital analysis across two distinct business product categories:
Professional and Food & Beverage. Our Professional product category, which represented
approximately 76% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2016, develops and delivers
integrated solutions comprised of chemicals, floor care machines, cleaning tools and utensils, and
digitally enabled systems for the institutional and janitorial markets. Our Food & Beverage product
category, which represented approximately 24% of net sales for the year ended December 31,
2016, develops and delivers solutions integrating chemicals, design engineering, cleaning protocols
and equipment, remote data monitoring and predictive analytics for food and beverage
manufacturers.

We are highly diversified across products and services, end-markets and geographies. Our
global operations have broad exposure and a significant presence throughout Europe, North
America (‘‘NAM’’), Asia Pacific (‘‘APAC’’), the Middle East and Africa (‘‘MEA’’) and Latin America
(‘‘LATAM’’). We have little reliance on any individual country. We serve in excess of 85,000
customers across more than 260,000 sites globally. Our extensive portfolio breadth reduces our
exposure to any one solution, with no individual product or service representing more than 0.9% of
total sales for the year ended December 31, 2016. We are further diversified across stable
end-markets, including food service, hospitality, beverages, building services and healthcare,
among others, with no individual end-market accounting for more than 14% of total sales for the
year ended December 31, 2016. We believe this high degree of diversification with low customer
concentration has generated revenue stability for us.

We believe we are differentiated from our competitors by our global footprint that reaches a
diverse customer base, as well as by the integrated high-touch service and end-to-end solutions we

1


-----

provide, our customized chemical formulations and our extensive suite of dosing and dispensing
equipment. We believe our products improve customers’ operational efficiency and their cleaning,
sanitizing and hygiene results, which has led to deeper customer relationships. Working in a highly
fragmented industry, we have a balance of direct selling capabilities and a global and regional
distribution network that reaches thousands of end-use customers. We have invested in research
that helps us understand our customers’ business needs, which we believe positions us as an
innovator and strong collaborative partner and enables us to deepen our customer relationships
and drive growth.

We are headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina, operate 16 chemical facilities on a global
basis and two equipment plants, and have a global customer facing team of approximately 6,000
employees including sales, marketing and technical service representatives along with
approximately 500 customer service representatives. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2017
(the ‘‘LTM Period’’), on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions, we generated
$2,565.0 million in net sales and $387.1 million in Further Adjusted EBITDA. See ‘‘—Summary
Historical and Pro Forma Financial Data’’ for a definition of Further Adjusted EBITDA and a
reconciliation of our pro forma net income (loss) to Further Adjusted EBITDA.

The following charts set forth our net sales by product, end-market, region and customer

**_Professional_**

Our Professional product category offers floor and building care chemicals, floor care
machines, cleaning tools, dosing and dispensing equipment, kitchen and mechanical washing
solutions, infection prevention and personal care, fabric care, odor control, carpet care and
restroom care. Our sustainable cleaning and hygiene solutions drive labor productivity, infection
prevention, food safety and enhance the customer experience. In addition to sales of chemicals and
equipment, we offer a range of solutions including engineering, consulting and training services
yielding higher productivity, risk management, data provided through its digital solutions and
sustainability benefits to customers across a wide range of end-markets. Many of the products we
offer in this product category are consumable in nature and require periodic replacement,
generating recurring revenue which we believe provides stability to our business.

2


-----

We are a global leader in our Professional product category. Based on 2016 net sales, we
believe we held the #1 market position in the Europe, MEA, LATAM and APAC regions and the #2
market position in North America. Our broad footprint, global presence and scale enable us to
consistently serve large global customers with added local insight and regional support to provide a
tailored solution and enhanced high-touch, value-added service offering. Our Professional product
category is focused on serving five primary institutional and industrial sectors globally: food service,
hospitality, facility service, food retail, and healthcare. Key representative customers include ISS,
Aramark, ABM, Sodexo, McDonalds, Walmart and Hilton.

Our extensive suite of cleaning products for the food service market includes chemicals for
washing dishes, utensils and kitchen equipment, food handling and storage products. Our broad
range of floor care products and systems include finishes, waxes and cleaners for all types of
flooring surfaces, including vinyl, granite, concrete, marble and wood. Our floor care products also
include carpet cleaning and floor care machines, utensils and tools, which support floor cleaning
and maintenance process. We also offer a fully integrated line of products and dispensing systems
for hard surface cleaning, disinfecting and sanitizing, handwashing, air deodorizing and freshening
and laundry care. Additionally, we provide technical assistance for efficacious application of these
chemicals and installation of our equipment at the customers’ sites increasing our stickiness with
the customers and thereby providing stability to our revenue base.

We also operate a Consumer Brands business within the Professional product category which
accounted for approximately $250.0 million of our 2016 net sales. This business distributes a broad
range of trusted consumer-branded cleaning and hygiene products such as DOVE Skin and Body
and OMO detergent to professional market customers such as hotels and professional laundries,
among others. As a partner for Fast Moving Consumer Goods (‘‘FMCG’’) companies, including a
longstanding strategic partnership with Unilever, we help create unique FMCG brand experiences
for customers in the non-residential markets (‘‘out-of-home’’). Our focus on creating long-term
consumer brand partnerships continues as evidenced by our newly established agreements with
Nakoma and Spectrum.

Our Professional product category accounted for $1,964.1 million, or approximately 76%, of
our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2016. Our gross margin in the Professional product
category for the year ended December 31, 2016 was 44.8%.

**_Food & Beverage_**

Our Food & Beverage product category provides cleaning-in-place (‘‘CIP’’) and open plant
systems that integrate cleaning chemicals, lubricants, floor care equipment and cleaning and
dispensing tools within the food and beverage end-market. We offer value-added knowledge-driven
engineering and project design solutions and installations including automated equipment for
dosing and distributing cleaning and sanitation solutions. Our hygiene and engineering solutions
are designed to improve productivity and food safety as well as generate water and energy savings
for our customers. To ensure proper implementation, we employ highly sophisticated technical
application experts to help customers achieve production efficiencies. Although cleaning chemicals
represent a small portion of total overall costs, they can have a high cost of failure due to their
significant impact on both the efficacy of cleaning solutions and operational costs. We believe our
customized product offerings enhance customer retention through mutual investment in
infrastructure and solutions.

We are also a global leader in our Food & Beverage product category. Based on 2016 net
sales, we believe we held the #1 position in MEA, #2 in Europe, APAC and LATAM and #3 in
North America. Our global scale enables us to consistently serve large multi-national customers
with added local insights and regional support to ensure a tailored, high-quality solution across

3


-----

customer sites. Our Food & Beverage product category is focused on serving four key sectors
globally: food processing, beverage companies, dairy, and other food and beverage
establishments. Key representative customers of the Food & Beverage product category include
Coke, AB InBev, Cargill, Diageo, Pepsi, Nestle, Danone, Kraft, Heinz, Heineken and Unilever.

Our extensive suite of products and services includes detergents, cleaners, sanitizers and
lubricants, as well as cleaning systems, electronic dispensers and chemical injectors for the
application of chemical products and improvement of operational efficiency. Through this platform,
we also offer gel and foam products for manual open plant cleaning, acid and alkaline cleaners and
membrane cleaning products. In addition, we provide consulting services in the areas of food
safety, water and energy use reduction and quality management. Through our data monitoring and
predictive analytics capabilities, we also help customers maximize efficiency of operations as well
as their profitability.

Our Food & Beverage product category accounted for $604.7 million, or approximately 24%,
of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2016. Our gross margin in the Food & Beverage
product category for the year ended December 31, 2016 was 39.7%.

**_Our Operations and Sales Model_**

We manufacture a diverse portfolio of finished goods utilizing a combination of internal
manufacturing sites and strategic contract manufacturing. Our internal manufacturing global
footprint consists of five factories in North America, six factories in Europe, two factories in MEA,
three factories in LATAM and two factories in APAC, which provide a strong base of owned asset
production facilities in established geographies and key emerging markets.

Our manufacturing strategy, which combines both internal and external manufacturing, enables
a flexible and geographically effective supply chain network for our chemical finished goods and
equipment. Contract manufacturing complements our internal manufacturing capability and
supports our existing offerings as well as innovations and new product launches, while limiting
capital investment. We contract with approximately 25 large strategic contract manufacturers which
we believe augments our global supply chain network with additional geographic coverage and
production capabilities. In developed markets, strategic contract manufacturers are used to leverage
variable capacity or for unique production capabilities. In emerging markets, contract manufacturers
provide strategic capacity where we do not yet have critical mass. In addition, we use
approximately 200 third-party manufacturers for sourcing highly unique or specialty products
included in our product portfolio. Our primary raw material inputs include caustic soda, solvents,
waxes, phosphates, surfactants, polymers and resins, chelates and fragrances. We also source
packaging components and equipment and accessories. Our packaging purchases include
bag-in-the-box containers, bottles, corrugated boxes, drums, pails, totes, aerosol cans, caps,
triggers and valves. Our equipment and accessories purchases include dilution control, ware
washing and laundry equipment, floor care machines, air care dispensers, floor care applicators,
mops, microfiber, buckets, carts and other items used in facility maintenance. Where contract
manufacturing is used, the production processes mirror those of our internal manufacturing plants
to ensure quality control. We believe all components related to raw materials, equipment and
accessories are readily available from multiple sources and to the extent possible, we offset higher
costs of materials through pricing increases.

We have long-term relationships with an extensive network of suppliers. Supplier contracts are
typically multiyear, with set pricing and renewal features built in and flexibility to adjust prices on the
basis of underlying fluctuation in raw material costs. The majority of our critical raw material inputs
are common to the industry and produced in all regions by multiple large, global suppliers,
ensuring attractive input prices.

-----

We reach customers via a combination of direct sales channels (which represented
approximately 76% of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2016, including
‘‘ship-through’’ sales, which involve a distributor-facilitated fulfillment where the customer
relationship is managed by Diversey and not the distributor) and distribution channels (which
represented 24% of sales for the year ended December 31, 2016). We employ a balanced
marketing strategy with a strong, global direct sales force as well as a broad network of third-party
distributors in key locations, whereas many of our competitors sell solely or primarily through
third-party distributors. We believe that this hybrid strategy provides us with access to an extensive
range of customers, while facilitating optimized operations in a cost-effective manner. We employ a
structure of dedicated professionals managing strategic accounts to build long-term customer
relationships. Our manufacturing network is supported by a global customer facing team of
approximately 6,000 employees including sales, marketing and technical service representatives
along with approximately 500 customer service representatives. Our in-house sales force directly
manages relationships with our large global and regional customers while our third-party distributor
partners enable us to reach end-users for which would not be profitable for us to serve directly. We
have invested in extensive training for our direct sales force and the management of our distributor
network, and we support our sales force with a deep bench of training and technical service
representatives.

Our global strategic accounts help differentiate us from our competitors and are a source of
significant profitability and growth through increased customer penetration and new customer wins.
They help us build long-term contractual relationships, set standards of cleaning and hygiene,
facilitate adoption of industry best practices, and provide a platform for local growth. We have 59
global strategic account contracts in place (which represented approximately 20% of our net sales
for the year ended December 31, 2016) and a robust pipeline of strategic accounts with projects
under implementation and opportunities to win substantial incremental sales. Sales growth among
our top 50 customers (based on 2015 net sales, excluding distribution) from January 1, 2015
through December 31, 2016 outpaced sales growth across the entire company over the same
period.

**_Customer Overview_**

Our Professional and Food & Beverage product categories serve customers across a wide
variety of stable and growing end-markets. Approximately three-quarters of our customer
relationships exceed 15 years in length. We have minimal concentration and high customer diversity
as our largest customer accounted for less than 3% of our net sales for the year ended
December 31, 2016, while our top 10 and 50 customers represented only 13% and 30% of our net
sales over the same period, respectively. Our highly fragmented customer base adds to stability of
our orders and revenue streams as activity across different customer groups is very diverse and
independent of activity among other customer categories. Some of our key customers include ISS,
ABM, Aramark, Heineken, Hilton, McDonalds, Nestle, Sodexo, Target and Walmart.

Our end-users span a wide range of business sectors, including food service, lodging, retail,
healthcare, building managers/service contractors, food and beverage, cash and carry
establishments, government institutions, industrial plants and on-premises laundry.

The following charts set forth, for each of our product categories, the end-markets served as a

customers are served through a combination of direct sales and service, with either direct or ship
through logistics, while our small independent customers are reached indirectly through a spectrum
of distributors, wholesalers and cash and carry.

In addition to providing cleaning and hygiene products, our application expertise, deep
industry process knowledge, and project engineering maximize product and operational efficiency,
resulting in sticky customer relationships. Additionally, we provide customized solutions for
customers which are integrated into customer sites, encouraging mutual investment in infrastructure
and increasing customer loyalty.

**_Research and Development_**

We maintain significant research and development (‘‘R&D’’) capabilities to ensure we continue
to remain an innovator and technological leader. We develop new products, applications, services,
and processes while providing technical assistance to improve our customers’ operations. We are
increasingly leveraging our digital capabilities in R&D, which we believe further differentiates us from
our competitors. Our value proposition is rooted in the integration of our proprietary technologies
with our customers’ manufacturing and service delivery value chain. We have R&D and application
support facilities in locations around the globe, including in North America, South America, Europe
and Asia, to facilitate hands-on interaction with our customers.

Substantially all of our principal products have been sourced and/or developed through R&D
endeavors by our in-house engineering personnel, and we maintain a robust pipeline of new
product development projects, which are in various stages of discovery and development.

**_Our Digital Innovation Capabilities_**

We maintain a portfolio of smart, connected, and data driven solutions that differentiate us
from our peers and lay the foundation for substantial future growth. Diversey’s digital innovation
initiative, called the ‘‘Internet of Clean’’, uses the ‘Internet of Things’ and robotics to create
differential value for its customers. This initiative intelligently connects facilities, equipment and
people, thereby resulting in improved internal operations and more efficient service. This trend of
digital integration supports improvements in customer productivity and labor savings via smart

cleaning devices and services. We believe we offer an industry-leading suite of innovative digital
products, which include:

Product Description

**IntelliDish** Remote monitoring system to optimize performance, productivity and
resources in commercial dishwashing operations

**IntelliTrail** A web-based GPS tracking solution which enables locating, monitoring and
managing fleets of machines

**Intellibot** Fully autonomous floor cleaning robots that drive safety, productivity and
operational improvement

**IntelliLinen** Reliable precision dosing of products, reporting and remote monitoring
features that drive improvement in fabric care operations

**IntelliCare** Remote maintenance and control of dispensers to optimize refilling, routing
and stock replanning

**IntelliConsult** Modular suite of food safety diagnostic tools and value-added digital
services

**Industry Overview**

We estimate that the global market for traditional cleaning and hygiene products and related
services generated annual industry-wide sales of approximately $32 billion for the year ended
December 31, 2016, of which professional comprises approximately $27 billion and food and
beverage the remainder. These figures exclude sales and industry growth related to digital
innovation/Internet of Clean and cleaning machines for the hygiene and cleaning industry. Our
industry has demonstrated stable growth trends over time due to its broad end-market exposure,
the consumable and recurring nature of its products and services, and secular demand driven by
underlying end-market trends such as increased regulation and heightened public awareness of
health, hygiene and infection risk.

We believe that we are one of the two largest global providers of institutional and industrial
cleaning, sanitation and hygiene products and related services globally and in most of the regions
in which we operate. Our industry is highly fragmented, and consists of several regional players
which we believe have a more limited product offering than ours. Large, multi-national customers
seek out our services given our scale, which is another competitive advantage, particularly relative
to competitors with a regional focus.

Our leadership position in these highly fragmented markets gives us an opportunity to make
accretive acquisitions, adding new technologies, end-market capabilities and sales and service

assets to our global platform. We have completed several tuck-in acquisitions over the last few
years and we continue to evaluate new opportunities in every geography.

firm’s research and analysis and management’s estimates.

**_Industry Growth Drivers_**

We believe that the Professional and Food & Beverage product categories of the traditional
cleaning and hygiene industry have demonstrated stable growth trends over time due to the
growing importance of hygiene and cleanliness across our highly diversified end-markets and
geographies. Governmental regulations for food safety and customer focus on hygiene and
cleanliness have also increased significantly across the world. Climate change, water scarcity and
environmental concerns have combined to create further demand for products, services and
solutions designed to minimize waste and drive broader sustainability.

We believe that the principal end-markets in which we operate will continue to grow at
attractive rates, supported by a number of key industry trends. The table below sets forth for each
of the end-markets that we serve the percentage of our net sales for the year ended December 31,
2016 allocated to that end-market and the estimated growth rate of that end-market from 2016 to
2021.

(1) Our projected market growth by end-market from 2016 to 2021 is sourced from a leading consulting firm’s research
and analysis, including Global Industry Analysts, IHS and market participants’ published statements.

Industry trends like the high cost of absenteeism, increased hygiene standards, rising hospital
acquired infection (‘‘HAI’’) costs, stringent food safety laws, high turnover in facilities management
staff and increased automation and digitization represent key drivers that underpin these expected
market growth rates. Specifically, we see six broad trends driving these growth rates:

   - Food Safety: Combatting the rise and frequency of foodborne illnesses, particularly as the
trend towards fast casual dining continues to grow.

8


-----

   - Regulatory: Changes in the regulatory environment continue to impact labeling and
classification of chemicals.

   - Infection Prevention: Continued high incidence of HAIs increases demand for continuous
improvements in infection prevention and hand hygiene.

   - Sustainability: Eco resource scarcity is increasingly a concern as the world becomes more
populated and resource needs outpace resource supply. In addition, increased urbanization
is driving greater awareness of resource conservation. This driver is particularly relevant
across all of our Professional product category end-markets, where regulation increasingly
requires sustainable solutions. In addition, our customers are becoming increasingly aware
of ‘‘green cleaning’’, which uses cleaning methods and products with environmentally
friendly ingredients, and procedures which are designed to preserve human health and
environmental quality.

   - Fast Moving Consumer Goods Penetration: Consumers look for products specifically
designed to fit their own unique profiles, needs and lifestyles.

   - Innovation: Shift toward the use of network-connected, physical devices embedded with
electronic, software, sensors and actuators that collect and exchange data, which creates
demand for our unique digitally-enabled solutions.

Although the industry is experiencing some shifting trends, we believe we are well positioned
relative to our global competition. While customers pay for chemicals, we focus on the importance
of providing a comprehensive solution, yielding high productivity, risk management and
sustainability to our customers. We have become an entrenched part of our customers’ value chain
and continue to help them protect their brands and drive profitability.

**Our Competitive Strengths**

**_Global Leader in Large and Fragmented Market — We believe that we are one of the two_**
largest global providers of institutional and industrial cleaning, sanitation and hygiene products and
related services. We estimate the size of the market in which we operate to be approximately
$32 billion, and that we hold a leading market position in each of the geographies that we serve.
We believe our scale and strong market position around the world differentiate us from the
numerous smaller local and regional competitors that make up a significant majority of the market,
enabling us to not only provide end-to-end solutions for the diverse needs of our customers but
also to consistently deliver our value-added products, services and solutions to global customers
with multiple points of contact and ensure our quality and standards of service are met across all
customer sites. Our scale and differentiated capabilities also allow us to invest in R&D aimed at
creating next-generation products and services designed to meet the specific needs of our
customers. We focus on designing solutions that deliver meaningful labor, energy and water
savings, thereby reducing customers’ operating costs while also supporting sustainability and
minimizing environmental impact. We are increasingly leveraging our digital capabilities in the
development of these products and services, which we believe further differentiates us from our
competitors.

**_Highly Diversified Across Structurally Attractive End-Markets — We believe that our broad_**
exposure to a variety of attractive and stable end-markets across the globe mitigate the potential
volatility of cyclical downturns in specific industries or regions. We have historically focused on the
more developed European and North American markets, but we are also expanding into higher
growth, emerging markets that are experiencing a greater focus on cleaning and hygiene
standards, thereby providing us an entry point into higher growth environments as compared to the
more mature regions we have historically served. We focus on serving the non-industrial,

9


-----

non-energy end-markets such as food service, hospitality, beverages, building services and
healthcare, which historically are less prone to volatile swings in performance during periods of
macroeconomic weakness due to such end-markets having more consistent demand through
economic cycles. We believe that this strategy helps mitigate the adverse effects of economic
cycles on our business. In addition to providing this downside protection, we believe these
end-markets will continue to grow at attractive rates in the future supported by a number of key
industry trends that drive demand for Diversey’s products and services.

**_Broad Portfolio of Product and Service Offerings — We believe we offer our customers the_**
most extensive range of cleaning, sanitizing and hygiene products and services, many of which are
consumable and must therefore be periodically replaced. While our products and services generally
represent a small percentage of our customers’ cost structure, our products and services are often
viewed as critical to our customers’ operations and brand protection, particularly in an environment
of increasing regulation and scrutiny of, and concern over, food safety, hygiene and infection
control. In addition, we offer our customers integrated solutions that consist of providing an
on-going supply of customized cleaning chemistries, machines, tools and utensils, as well as
providing installation, maintenance, training and technical support. We believe that these integrated
offerings appeal to our customers because they promote higher productivity and generate
operational savings.

**_Established Long-Term Relationships Across an Attractive Customer Base — The products_**
and services we provide our customers are critical to meeting their cleaning and hygiene needs.
Our customers include many of the largest, most established, and most well-known companies in
their industries, including leading global building service contractors, hotel operators, food and
beverage processors, retail and consumer products companies, educational institutions and
healthcare facilities. Among our largest customers are beverage companies The Coca-Cola
Company and Heineken, pharmaceutical retailer Walgreens and global facilities services providers
ISS and Aramark.

While we service many of the largest companies in their respective sectors, our customer base
is highly fragmented, with no single customer representing more than 3% of net sales for the year
ended December 31, 2016, and our ten largest customers representing approximately 13% of net
sales for the same period. In addition, we have been able to maintain long-term relationships with
many of our top customers, promoting a stable and recurring revenue stream. Approximately
three-quarters of our customer relationships exceed 15 years in length. Our consultative sales and
service model often involves either installation of our technologies at customers’ facilities or
investments in training our customers’ employees to effectively use our products and operate our
cleaning systems. We believe that these investments make us a valuable and entrenched partner to
our customers, providing meaningful incentives for long-term relationships and continued use of our
products, services and solutions. This is evidenced by our consistently high rate of customer
retention, which was on average 98% for our Professional product category, 96% for our
Food & Beverage product category and 98% for our company as a whole, in each case, over the
2015 and 2016 fiscal years.

**_Strong, Resilient Financial Performance and Stable Free Cash Flow Characteristics — We_**
have an attractive financial profile highlighted by our stable and diversified revenue streams,
historical margin expansion and strong free cash flow generation. Our strong free cash flow
generation, which we define as Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditures, is attributable to
attractive gross margins, a high degree of operational leverage across our selling, general and
administrative expenses, and minimal capital expenditures. For the 2015 and 2016 fiscal years, we
converted, on average, approximately 80% of Adjusted EBITDA into free cash flow. Our Adjusted
EBITDA margin expanded approximately 120 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2016

10


-----

as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. During previous economic cycles, our
diversified business model and flexible cost structure have allowed us to perform well in the cyclical
down-turns in the end-markets we serve. Additionally, the Transactions have been structured in a
tax-efficient manner and are expected to further optimize our required cash tax obligations, following
their consummation. We believe that our business has the capability to support further growth while
also taking advantage of operating leverage and the benefits of the cost rationalization initiatives
described below, all of which we believe will allow us to continue to sustainably generate strong
cash flow.

**_Experienced Management Team with Strong Sponsorship — We are led by a senior_**
management team with significant industry, manufacturing and marketing experience which has
implemented various initiatives that have contributed, and will continue to contribute, to our
operational and financial performance. We will also benefit from the support and expertise of
Bain Capital, which has extensive expertise in investments in industrial companies and carve-out
transactions and has delivered attractive returns to its investors by driving operational improvements
in its portfolio companies. Bain Capital has a successful track record of operating businesses
through transformative periods and is committed to helping us continue to execute on our growth
strategies, broaden our customer reach, continue to innovate and develop new products, and
achieve the expected benefits from the cost rationalization initiatives we intend to undertake.

**Our Business Strategy**

**_Capitalize on Attractive Trends to Drive Growth — Governmental regulations for food safety_**
and disease control and consumer focus on hygiene and cleanliness have both increased
significantly across many of the jurisdictions in which we operate in recent years. Climate change,
water scarcity and environmental concerns have combined to create further demand for products,
services and solutions designed to minimize waste and support broader sustainability. In addition,
many of our customers require tailored cleaning solutions that can assist in reducing labor, energy,
water use and the costs related to cleaning, sanitation and hygiene activities. We help our
customers realize efficiencies throughout the operation of their facilities by developing customized
solutions. We are targeting high growth end-markets like healthcare through our registered
disinfection portfolio based on Accelerated Hydrogen Peroxide (‘‘AHP’’). Our AHP products are
targeted for use in hospitals, nursing homes and other locations where virus outbreaks are most
common. We believe that our value-added customer service approach and proven commitment to
providing cost-savings and sustainable solutions position us well to address these and other critical
demand drivers in order to drive revenue growth.

**_Leverage Our Global Scale to Serve National and Multinational Customers — As a global_**
provider offering a full range of cleaning and hygiene products, services and solutions, we believe
we can leverage our scale and expertise to meet our customers’ increasingly complex needs and
support them as they pursue expansion into new geographies. We believe that a significant
percentage of the total customer base in our industry is served by smaller local and regional
players, many of which we believe lack the breadth of capabilities and scale to compete effectively
long-term in an industry driven by increasingly stringent regulatory and hygiene standards. We have
a long and demonstrated track record of growth with large multinational customers, and we expect
that our global scale will continue to attractively position us to win incremental business from these
customers. Our enhanced focus on global strategic accounts helps differentiate us by building
long-term relationships with global clients, syncing our offerings with client goals, setting industry
standards of cleaning and hygiene and providing a platform for local growth.

**_Continued Focus on Commercial Excellence — We employ a balanced marketing strategy_**
with a strong, global direct sales force complemented by a broad network of third-party distributors

11


-----

in key locations, whereas the majority of our competitors sell solely or primarily through third-party
distributors. We believe that this hybrid strategy provides us with access to an extensive range of
customers while allowing us to optimize our operations in a cost-effective manner. Our global
strategic accounts have historically driven higher organic growth and we have improved sales force
efficiency by redesigning our operating model and commercial organization. We believe there is
further opportunity to optimize our commercial organization following our separation from Sealed
Air. We believe there is meaningful long-term opportunity to continue improving our commercial
organization to grow our business and solidify our customer relationships — for example, through
integrating CRM systems and eliminating products or services that are not creating value for our
customers.

**_Maintain Our Leadership Through Research and Development and Product Innovation —_**
We intend to build on our portfolio of customized and value-added products, services and solutions
to meet current and future demands of end-users. Under Sealed Air’s ownership, we centralized
our R&D functions, and we believe this reorganization has enhanced our responsiveness to
customer needs and time-to-market in product development. Products we have developed, such as
Oxivir formulations, Clax Xcellence and Advance, and Taski Swingo 2100 and XP, address our
customers’ requirements for more cost efficient and environmentally sensitive cleaning solutions
and are important to our ability to maintain loyalty in our existing customer base as well as attract
new customers. These innovations and their commercialization are the outgrowth of the insights we
developed through in-depth attitudinal, behavioral and ethnographic customer research, through
which we applied a new level of market analysis and capabilities to our business. We also
continually evaluate acquisition opportunities to supplement, and further accelerate, our
organically-derived innovation initiatives.

**_Cost Rationalization Initiatives — We plan to leverage the opportunity offered by the_**
carve-out of Diversey from Sealed Air to improve our operations and generate substantial cost
savings as a standalone company. As an independent, service-oriented company, we intend to
enhance and simplify our business processes, rationalize our cost base and focus on initiatives to
drive growth and improve financial performance. These initiatives can be grouped into four major
categories: (1) reducing back-office costs, (2) improving our procurement strategy, (3) enhancing
the efficiency of our manufacturing and supply chain networks, and (4) continuing our focus on
improving commercial excellence and sales force productivity. The levers available to us to
implement these initiatives are numerous and include reducing headcount in non-customer facing
areas of our business, consolidating expenditures across our highly fragmented supplier base as
well as rationalizing our manufacturing facility footprint to enhance overall utilization and
performance. Under Sealed Air’s ownership, we lacked control over certain critical business
functions, which limited our ability to optimize many of these factors to suit our standalone business
needs.

We have included in our Further Adjusted EBITDA an estimated approximately $55 million of
benefit from the completion of such initiatives, comprised of $30 million of back office savings
related to headcount rationalization to be implemented in early 2018 and $25 million of chemicals,
equipment and packaging procurement savings to be implemented by the end of 2018. We expect
that there will be additional opportunities to achieve further cost savings through these initiatives as
well as by optimizing our manufacturing and supply chain networks and focusing on productivity
and commercial excellence.

**The Transactions**

**_The Acquisition_**

On March 25, 2017, the Issuer entered into a purchase agreement with Sealed Air (the
‘‘Purchase Agreement’’) pursuant to which certain private investment funds and/or vehicles affiliated
with Bain Capital will, through the Issuer and its subsidiaries, acquire Diversey from Sealed Air for
approximately $3.2 billion, subject to customary purchase price adjustments, otherwise referred to
herein as the ‘‘Acquisition’’. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the Issuer and its subsidiaries will
purchase all of the assets and certain equity interests related to Diversey from Sealed Air and its
subsidiaries. Consummation of the Acquisition is subject to works council approvals in the
Netherlands, antitrust approvals in the U.S., European Union (‘‘EU’’), Brazil, Russia, China,
South Africa, Turkey and Mexico, Sealed Air refinancing its existing credit facilities and other
customary closing conditions, and is expected to close during September of 2017. The required

offering circular.

**_The Financing Transactions_**

In connection with the Acquisition, we anticipate entering into the following financing
transactions (the ‘‘Financing Transactions’’):

   - a new $1,802.0 million senior secured term loan facility (the ‘‘Term Loan Facility’’) consisting
of a $900.0 million U.S. dollar denominated tranche and an e820.0 million euro-denominated
tranche (or $902.0 million using an exchange rate of e1.00=$1.1000, which takes into
account that in connection with the Transactions, we entered into a foreign currency forward
contract to fix the amount receivable with respect to (x) the euro-denominated tranche of the
Term Loan Facility and (y) the notes offered hereby, which such forward contract fixed the
euro-to-dollar exchange rate at the rate then in effect at the signing of the Purchase
Agreement);

   - a new $250.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the ‘‘Revolving Credit Facility’’
and, together with the Term Loan Facility, the ‘‘Senior Secured Credit Facilities’’), which is
expected to be undrawn upon the completion of the Transactions; however, at closing we
may draw (x) up to $40.0 million to fund acquisition and transaction costs, (y) amounts to
pay certain original issue discount (‘‘OID’’) or upfront fees, if any, and (z) additional amounts
to fund working capital needs (including purchase price adjustment payments owed under
the Purchase Agreement);

   - an equity contribution of approximately $815.0 million in cash by Bain Capital (the ‘‘Equity
Contribution’’);

   - the issuance of e545.0 million aggregate principal amount of notes offered hereby (or
$599.5 million using an exchange rate of e1.00=$1.1000, which takes into account that in
connection with the Transactions, we entered into a foreign currency forward contract to fix
the amount receivable with respect to (x) the euro-denominated tranche of the Term Loan
Facility and (y) the notes offered hereby, which such forward contract fixed the euro-to-dollar
exchange rate at the rate then in effect at the signing of the Purchase Agreement) and the
use of proceeds thereof as described in this offering circular; and

   - the release of the net proceeds of this offering from escrow on or prior to the Outside Date.

We expect to finance the Acquisition and pay related fees and expenses and fund working
capital needs with the proceeds of the Financing Transactions. The Equity Contribution and the
closing of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities are expected to occur substantially concurrently with

13


-----

the Acquisition and the release of the net proceeds of this offering from the Escrow Account as
described below.

The Acquisition and the Financing Transactions are collectively referred to herein as the
‘‘Transactions’’.

**_Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption_**

This offering will be consummated prior to the consummation of the Acquisition.
Consequently, concurrently with the consummation of the offering, the Issuer will enter into an
escrow agreement relating to the notes (the ‘‘Escrow Agreement’’) with the trustee and JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A., acting through its London branch, as escrow agent (in such capacity, the
‘‘Escrow Agent’’). Pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, on the closing date of this offering the Issuer
will deposit (or cause to be deposited) cash in an amount equal to the gross proceeds from this
offering into a segregated escrow account (the ‘‘Escrow Account’’) in the name of the Escrow
Agent for the benefit of the holders of the notes. The Escrow Account will be pledged on a
first-ranking basis in favor of the Trustee on behalf of the holders of the notes. See ‘‘Description of
Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption’’.

Pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, the release of the escrowed funds will be subject to the
satisfaction of certain conditions (collectively, the ‘‘Escrow Release Conditions’’), including, among
others: (i) the satisfaction or waiver of all conditions precedent to the consummation of the
Acquisition in accordance with the Purchase Agreement and the consummation of the Acquisition;
(ii) the satisfaction or waiver of all the conditions precedent to the effectiveness of, and borrowings
under, the credit agreement governing the Senior Secured Credit Facilities; and (iii) the guarantors
who will guarantee the Senior Secured Credit Facilities as of the consummation of the Acquisition
shall have, by supplemental indenture, effective upon the Escrow Release Date (as defined below),
become or, substantially concurrently with the release of the funds from escrow, shall become
parties to the indenture that will govern the notes. The timing for signing the indenture that will
govern the notes and providing such guarantee shall be subject to the restrictions, if any, under the
laws of the jurisdiction of each guarantor, as applicable.

Upon delivery to the Escrow Agent and the trustee on or prior to the Outside Date of an
officer’s certificate instructing the Escrow Agent to release the escrowed funds to the Issuer (the
date of such release being referred to as the ‘‘Escrow Release Date’’) and stating that concurrently
with the release of funds from escrow the Escrow Release Conditions have been, or will be,
satisfied on or prior to the Outside Date, the escrowed funds will be released to the Issuer to
finance a portion of the cash purchase price of the Acquisition.

Upon the earliest of (x) 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Outside Date, if the Issuer has
not delivered to the Escrow Agent and the trustee the officer’s certificate referenced above by such
time or (y) receipt by the Escrow Agent and the trustee at any time prior to 5:00 p.m., New York
City time, on the Outside Date of an officer’s certificate certifying that (A) the Issuer will not pursue
the consummation of the Acquisition or (B) the Purchase Agreement has been amended, modified
or waived or any consent granted in a manner that would be materially adverse to the holders of
the notes or has otherwise been terminated, the notes will be subject to a special mandatory
redemption (a ‘‘Special Mandatory Redemption’’) at a redemption price equal to 100% of the
principal amount of the notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any,
from the issue date to, but excluding, the redemption date (the ‘‘Special Mandatory Redemption
Price’’). Until their release from escrow, the escrowed funds will be pledged as collateral for the
benefit of the holders of the notes. See ‘‘Description of Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special
Mandatory Redemption’’.

14


-----

In the event that the Special Mandatory Redemption Price payable upon a Special Mandatory
Redemption exceeds the amount of the escrowed property, the Bain Capital Fund (as defined in
‘‘Description of Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption’’) will be required to
transfer an amount of cash in euro to the Issuer that will be sufficient to enable the Issuer to pay
the accrued and unpaid interest, plus additional amounts, if any, owing to the holders of the notes,
pursuant to an irrevocable equity commitment letter issued by the Bain Capital Fund. See ‘‘Risk
Factors—Risks Related to the Escrow of Proceeds—In the event that the Acquisition is not
consummated on or prior to the Outside Date and the other Escrow Release Conditions are not
satisfied or the terms of the Escrow Agreement are not otherwise complied with, the notes will be
subject to a Special Mandatory Redemption and, as a result, you may not obtain the return you
expect on the notes’’ and ‘‘Description of Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory
Redemption’’.

**_Sources and Uses of Funds_**

The following table illustrates the estimated sources and uses of funds for the Transactions.
Actual amounts could vary from estimated amounts depending on several factors, including
changes in the cash purchase price for Diversey based on any change in the amount of estimated
cash and working capital of Diversey at closing and changes in our actual amount of expenses
related to the Transactions. You should read the following together with the information included

working capital needs (including working capital payments under the Purchase Agreement). See ‘‘—The Transactions’’
and ‘‘Description of Certain Other Indebtedness’’.

(2) We currently expect all of the Issuer’s existing and subsequently acquired or organized direct or indirect material
wholly-owned restricted subsidiaries that guarantee indebtedness under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities (other
than those organized in Italy) will guaratee the notes, including all of our material subsidiaries organized in Australia,
Austria, Brazil, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Mexico, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain,
Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States upon the completion of the Transactions, subject to
the restrictions of the laws of the jurisdiction of organization of each guarantor. All of our guarantor subsidiaries are
directly or indirectly wholly-owned. The notes will not be guaranteed by Holdings or any of the Issuer’s subsidiaries
prior to the consummation of the Acquisition.

(3) The Issuer has subsidiaries organized in 68 different jurisdictions around the world. The Issuer’s subsdiairies
organized in jurisdictions other than those listed in footnote (2) above will not guarantee the notes or the Senior
Secured Credit Facilities. A limited number of our non-guarantor subsidiaries are not wholly owned. For the LTM
Period, the Diversey subsidiaries that will not guarantee the notes represented approximately 37.1% and 45.9% of
Diversey’s consolidated net sales and consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, respectively. As of March 31, 2017, those
non-guarantor subsidiaries accounted for approximately 34.7% of Diversey’s total assets (excluding assets not being
acquired in the Transactions). See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes and Our Indebtedness—Claims of
holders of the notes will be structurally subordinated to claims of creditors of certain of the Issuer’s subsidiaries that
will not guarantee the notes’’.

**The Offering**

_The summary below describes the principal terms of the notes. Some of the terms and_
_conditions described below are subject to important limitations and exceptions. See ‘‘Description of_
_Notes’’ for a more detailed description of the terms and conditions of the notes._

**Issuer . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** Diamond (BC) B.V., a private limited liability company
(besloten vennootschap met beperkte aansprakelijkheid)
incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands.

**Notes Offered . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** e545,000,000 aggregate principal amount of % senior
notes due 2025.

**Maturity . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The notes will mature on, 2025.

**Interest . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** Interest on the notes will accrue at a rate of % per
annum, payable semi-annually in cash in arrears on
and of each year, commencing
, 2018. Interest will accrue from
, 2017.

**Guarantees . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** Prior to the Escrow Release Date, the notes will not be
guaranteed but will be secured by a first priority lien on the
escrow account and the funds held therein for the benefit of
the holders of the notes. From and after the Escrow Release
Date, the notes will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed,
jointly and severally, on a senior unsecured basis by
Holdings and the Issuer’s existing and subsequently
acquired or organized direct and indirect material whollyowned restricted subsidiaries that guarantee indebtedness
under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities (other than those
organized in Italy). The timing for providing such guarantees
will be subject to any restrictions under the laws of the
jurisdiction of each guarantor, as applicable.

The guarantees of the notes of any guarantor will be
released in the event such guarantor’s guarantee under the
Senior Secured Credit Facilities is released (except in the
case of the repayment in full or termination of the Senior
Secured Credit Facilities). See ‘‘Description of Notes—Note
Guarantees’’.

**Escrow of Proceeds . . . . . . . . . . .** The offering will be consummated prior to the
consummation of the Acquisition. Consequently,
concurrently with the consummation of the offering, the
Issuer will enter into the Escrow Agreement with the Escrow
Agent and the trustee. Pursuant to the Escrow Agreement
and the indenture that will govern the notes, on the closing
date of this offering the Issuer will deposit (or cause to be
deposited) into the Escrow Account cash in an amount
equal to the gross proceeds from this offering. The Escrow
Account will be pledged on a first-ranking basis in favor of
the trustee on behalf of itself and the holders of the notes.

18


-----

Upon delivery to the Escrow Agent and the trustee of an
officer’s certificate from the Issuer stating that the other
Escrow Release Conditions have been or will be satisfied on
or prior to the Outside Date, the escrowed funds will be
released from the security interest created in favor of the
trustee and delivered to the Issuer and utilized as described
in ‘‘Summary—The Transactions’’, ‘‘Use of Proceeds’’ and
‘‘Description of Notes—Special Mandatory Redemption;
Escrow of Proceeds’’. The Escrow Release Conditions
include the closing of the Acquisition. If the Purchase
Agreement is amended, modified or waived in a manner
that is materially adverse to the holders of the notes or the
Purchase Agreement is otherwise terminated, if the
Acquisition is not consummated on or prior to the Outside
Date or if we determine not to pursue the consummation of
the Acquisition, then in each case, the notes will be subject
to a Special Mandatory Redemption at the Special
Mandatory Redemption Price. The escrowed funds would be
applied to pay for any Special Mandatory Redemption. In
the event that the Special Mandatory Redemption Price
payable upon a Special Mandatory Redemption exceeds the
amount of the escrowed property, the Bain Capital Fund will
be required to transfer an amount of cash in euro to the
Issuer that will be sufficient to enable the Issuer to pay the
accrued and unpaid interest, plus additional amounts, if any,
owing to the holders of the notes, pursuant to an
irrevocable equity commitment letter issued by the Bain
Capital Fund. See ‘‘Description of Notes—Escrow of
Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption’’.

**Ranking . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The notes will be the Issuer’s and, from and after the
Escrow Release Date, the notes and the guarantees will be
the Issuer’s and the guarantors’ general senior unsecured
obligations and will rank:

                     - equally in right of payment with all of the Issuer’s and the
guarantors’ other existing and future senior indebtedness;

                     - effectively subordinated to all of the Issuer’s and the
guarantors’ existing and future secured indebtedness,
including indebtedness under the Senior Secured Credit
Facilities, to the extent of the value of the assets securing
such indebtedness; and

                     - senior in right of payment to all of the Issuer’s and the
guarantors’ existing and future subordinated indebtedness
and other obligations that expressly provide for their
subordination to the notes and the guarantees.

19


-----

The notes and the guarantees will also be structurally
subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness, claims
of holders of preferred stock and other liabilities of the
Issuer’s existing and future subsidiaries that do not
guarantee the notes.

As of March 31, 2017, on a pro forma basis after giving
effect to the Transactions:

                   - the Issuer and the guarantors would have had
e545.0 million of indebtedness represented by the notes
offered hereby (or approximately $581.7 million using an
exchange rate of e1.00=$1.0674 as of March 31, 2017);
and

                   - the Issuer and the guarantors of the notes would have
had $1,775.3 million of secured indebtedness (including
indebtedness under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities)
and an additional $250.0 million of availability under the
Revolving Credit Facility, all of which would have been
secured. No letters of credit are expected to be issued
and outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility as of
the date of the consummation of the Transactions, but
letters of credit, if issued, may be drawn after the closing
date of the Transactions or, subject to certain limitations,
on such closing date.

For the LTM Period, the Diversey subsidiaries that will not
guarantee the notes represented approximately 37.1% and
45.9% of Diversey’s consolidated net sales and consolidated
Adjusted EBITDA, respectively. As of March 31, 2017, those
non-guarantor subsidiaries accounted for approximately
34.7% of Diversey’s total assets (excluding assets not being
acquired in the Transactions). See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks
Relating to the Notes and Our Indebtedness—Claims of
holders of the notes will be structurally subordinated to
claims of creditors of certain of the Issuer’s subsidiaries that
will not guarantee the notes’’.

**Optional Redemption . . . . . . . . . .** The Issuer may redeem the notes, in whole or in part, at
any time prior to, 2020, at a price equal to
100% of the principal amount of the notes redeemed, plus
accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the
redemption date, plus a ‘‘make-whole’’ premium, as
described under ‘‘Description of Notes—Optional
Redemption’’.

The Issuer may also redeem the notes, in whole or in part,
at any time on or after, 2020, at the
applicable redemption price set forth under ‘‘Description of
Notes—Optional Redemption’’, plus accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date.

20


-----

In addition, the Issuer may redeem up to 40% of the
aggregate principal amount of the notes at any time prior to
, 2020 using the net cash proceeds from
certain equity offerings at the redemption price specified
under ‘‘Description of Notes—Optional Redemption’’, plus
accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the
redemption date.

For more information, see ‘‘Description of Notes—Optional
Redemption’’.

**Additional Amounts; Tax**
**Redemption . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** All payments made by the Issuer or any guarantor under or
with respect to the notes or the guarantees will be made
without withholding or deduction for taxes or other
governmental charges in any relevant tax jurisdiction, except
to the extent required by law. If withholding or deduction is
required by law, the Issuer or the relevant guarantor will pay
additional amounts so that the net amount you receive is no
less than that which you would have received in the
absence of such withholding or deduction, subject to certain
exceptions. See ‘‘Description of Notes—Additional
Amounts’’.

If certain changes in the law of any relevant tax jurisdiction
become effective that would impose withholding taxes or
other deductions on the payments on the notes, the Issuer
may redeem the notes in whole, but not in part, at any time,
at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount, plus
accrued and unpaid interest, if any, and additional amounts,
if any, to, but excluding, the date of redemption. See
‘‘Description of Notes—Redemption Upon a Tax Event’’.

**Change of Control Offer . . . . . . . .** Upon the occurrence of certain kinds of changes of control,
you will have the right, as holders of the notes, to require
the Issuer to repurchase some or all of your notes at a price
equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued
and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the repurchase
date. See ‘‘Description of Notes—Change of Control’’.

**Certain Covenants . . . . . . . . . . . .** The indenture that will govern the notes will contain
covenants that, among other things, will limit the Issuer’s
ability and the ability of its restricted subsidiaries to:

                     - incur additional debt or issue certain preferred shares;

                      - incur certain liens;

                    - make certain distributions, dividends, investments and
other restricted payments;

                     - engage in certain transactions with affiliates;

                     - enter into agreements that restrict the ability of
subsidiaries to make dividends or other payments to the
Issuer; and

                     - merge or consolidate or sell, transfer, lease or otherwise
dispose of all or substantially all of our assets.

These covenants are subject to important exceptions and
qualifications as described under ‘‘Description of Notes—
Certain Covenants’’.

Certain of these covenants will cease to apply to the notes
during any time that the notes have investment grade
ratings from both Moody’s Investors Service, Inc.
(‘‘Moody’s’’) and Standard & Poor’s Financial Services LLC
(‘‘S&P’’) and no default has occurred and is continuing
under the indenture that will govern the notes. See
‘‘Description of Notes—Certain Covenants’’.

**Transfer Restrictions; No**
**Registration Rights . . . . . . . . . .** The notes and the guarantees have not been and will not
be registered under the Securities Act or any state or other
securities laws, and we are under no obligation to so
register the notes. The notes are subject to restrictions on
transfer and may not be offered or sold except pursuant to
an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the
registration requirements of the Securities Act. See ‘‘Transfer
Restrictions’’. Holders of the notes will not be entitled to
registration rights, and we do not intend to issue registered
notes and guarantees in exchange for the notes and the
guarantees to be placed in this offering. The absence of
registration rights may adversely impact the transferability of
the notes. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes
and Our Indebtedness—Holders of the notes will not be
entitled to registration rights, and we do not currently intend
to register the notes under applicable securities laws. There
are restrictions on your ability to transfer or resell the
notes’’.

**No Prior Market . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The notes will be a new issue of securities for which there is
currently no market. Although the initial purchasers have
informed us that they intend to make a market in the notes,
they are not obligated to do so, and they may discontinue
market making activities at any time without notice.
Accordingly, we cannot assure you that a liquid market for
the notes will develop or, if such a market develops, that it
will be maintained.

**Listing . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** An initial application has been made to the Authority for the
listing of and permission to deal in the notes on the Official
List of the Exchange. There is no assurance that the notes
will be listed on the Official List of the Exchange, that such
permission to deal in the notes will be granted or that such
listing will be maintained.

22


-----

**Use of Proceeds . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** We expect the net proceeds from this offering will be
approximately $ million, after deducting the initial
purchasers’ discounts and commissions. We converted the
net proceeds of this offering of e545.0 million aggregate
principal amount of euro dominated senior notes into
U.S. dollars using the, 2017 exchange rate of
e1.00=$ . Upon release from escrow, we intend to
use the net proceeds from the issuance and sale of the
notes offered hereby, together with the borrowings under
the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the Equity
Contribution, to (i) finance the Acquisition and (ii) pay fees
and expenses in connection with the Transactions.

**Trustee . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** Wilmington Trust, National Association.

**Escrow Agent . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., acting through its London

other information contained in this offering circular before

**Summary Historical and Pro Forma Financial Data**

The following table sets forth our summary historical and pro forma financial data as of and for
the periods indicated. We have derived the summary combined financial data as of and for the
fiscal years ended December 31, 2015 and 2016 from our audited combined financial statements
for such years. We have derived the summary financial data as of March 31, 2017 and for the three
months ended March 31, 2016 and 2017 from our unaudited combined financial statements for
such periods, which contain all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments that
management considers necessary for a fair statement of our financial position and results of
operations for the periods presented. Operating results for the three months ended March 31, 2016
and 2017 are not necessarily indicative of results for a full fiscal year, or any other periods. Our
audited combined financial statements as of and for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2015 and
2016 and our unaudited combined financial statements as of March 31, 2017 and for the three
months ended March 31, 2016 and 2017 have been included elsewhere in this offering circular.

The summary unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations data for the
LTM Period has been derived by adding our historical combined statement of operations data for
the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 and the three months ended March 31, 2017 and
subtracting our historical combined statement of operations data for the three months ended
March 31, 2016, and applying pro forma adjustments to give effect to the Transactions as if they
had occurred on January 1, 2016. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet
data gives effect to the Transactions as if they had occurred on March 31, 2017. The summary
unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial data is for informational purposes only, is
based upon available information and certain assumptions that we believe are reasonable and does
not purport to represent what our results of operations or financial position would be had the
Transactions occurred at any prior date, nor do such data purport to project the results of
operations for any future period. The actual pro forma adjustments may differ from those reflected
in this section and such differences may be material.

The summary historical combined data presented below should be read in conjunction with
‘‘Use of Proceeds’’, ‘‘Capitalization’’, ‘‘Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial
Information’’, ‘‘Selected Historical Combined Financial Data’’, ‘‘Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations’’ and our combined audited and
unaudited financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this offering
circular.

(gains) losses, were not reflected in our calculation of our historical cash flow from operating activities. Such non-cash
items were reflected within our historical cash flow from financing activities.

(3) Amounts (x) exclude expenditures on dosing and dispensing equipment, which consisted of $45.2 million,
$50.7 million, $2.8 million, $16.5 million and $64.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, the year ended
December 31, 2016, the three months ended March 31, 2016, the three months ended March 31, 2017 and the LTM
Period, respectively, and (y) include one-time expenditures related to corporate integration or restructuring efforts of
$20.0 million, $4.6 million, $2.3 million, $0.2 million and $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, the year
ended December 31, 2016, the three months ended March 31, 2016, the three months ended March 31, 2017 and the
LTM Period, respectively.

(4) Calculated as current assets minus current liabilities.

(5) We have presented EBITDA, which is defined as net earnings (loss) before interest expense, provision (benefit) for
income taxes and depreciation and amortization, Adjusted EBITDA, which is defined as EBITDA adjusted for the other
items described in the footnotes below (other than footnote (g)) and Further Adjusted EBITDA, which is defined as
Adjusted EBITDA adjusted for the items described in footnote (g) below, each of which is considered a non-GAAP
financial measure. Our non-GAAP financial measures are included in this offering circular as supplemental measures
of our liquidity and performance and because we believe such measures are frequently used by securities analysts,
investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in our industry

Our non-GAAP financial measures are not measures of our liquidity or financial performance under GAAP and should
not be considered as alternatives to net earnings (loss), earnings (loss) before income taxes or any other performance
measures derived in accordance with GAAP, or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of
our liquidity. The use of our non-GAAP financial measures instead of net earnings has limitations as an analytical tool,
including the failure to reflect changes in cash requirements, including cash requirements necessary to service
principal or interest payments on our debt, pay our income taxes, or invest in our maintenance and growth capital
expenditures or in our working capital needs. Management compensates for these limitations by relying primarily on
our GAAP results and by using our non-GAAP financial measures only supplementally. Other companies in our
industry may calculate these measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as a comparative measure. See
‘‘Non-GAAP Financial Measures’’.

(f) Represents the annual management fee to be paid to affiliates of Bain Capital in accordance with the new
Management Agreement to be entered into at the closing of the Transactions. See ‘‘Certain Relationships and

(g) Bain Capital has identified several cost savings opportunities that we believe could have been realized during
the twelve months ended March 31, 2017 assuming the Transactions were completed as of the beginning of
such period. These cost savings initiatives can be grouped into four major categories: (1) reducing back-office
costs, (2) improving our procurement strategy, (3) enhancing the efficiency of our manufacturing and supply
chain networks and (4) continuing our focus on improving commercial excellence and sales force productivity.
The following table presents the selling, general and administrative expenses and procurement savings
identified by Bain Capital that we believe can be realized by the end of 2018 following the closing of the
Acquisition. In addition to the $55.0 million in cost savings identified below, we expect that there will be
additional opportunities to achieve further cost savings through these initiatives as well as by optimizing our
manufacturing and supply chain networks and focusing on productivity and commercial excellence. Amounts
shown have not been adjusted to reflect one-time expenses that we expect to incur in connection with
achieving such cost savings. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Acquisition—We may not achieve some
or all of the expected benefits of the Transactions, and the Transactions may adversely affect our business’’ and

**RISK FACTORS**

_Investing in the notes involves risk. You should consider carefully all of the information set forth_
_in this offering circular and, in particular, the following risks before you decide to invest in the notes._
_If any of the following uncertainties or risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition or_
_results of operations could be materially adversely affected. The risks described below are not the_
_only risks that may affect your investment. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to_
_us or that we currently view as immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business,_
_financial condition or results of operations._

**Risks Related to Our Business**

**_Uncertain global economic conditions have had and could continue to have an adverse effect_**
**_on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations._**

Uncertain global economic conditions have had and may continue to have an adverse impact
on our business in the form of lower net sales due to weakened demand, unfavorable changes in
product price/mix, or lower profit margins. For example, global economic downturns have adversely
impacted some of our end-users and customers, such as food processors, distributors,
supermarket retailers, hotels, restaurants, retail establishments, business service contractors,
e-commerce fulfillment firms, and other end-users that are particularly sensitive to business and
consumer spending.

During economic downturns or recessions, there can be a heightened competition for sales
and increased pressure to reduce selling prices as our customers may reduce their volume of
purchases from us. If we lose significant sales volume or reduce selling prices significantly, then
there could be a negative impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations,
profitability and cash flows.

Also, reduced availability of credit may adversely affect the ability of some of our customers
and suppliers to obtain funds for operations and capital expenditures. This could negatively impact
our ability to obtain necessary supplies as well as our sales of materials and equipment to affected
customers. This also could result in reduced or delayed collections of outstanding accounts
receivable.

**_The global nature of our operations exposes us to numerous risks that could materially_**
**_adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and results of operations._**

We operate in approximately 57 countries, and our products are distributed in those countries
as well as in other parts of the world. A large portion of our manufacturing operations are located
outside of the U.S. and a majority of our net sales are generated outside of the U.S. These
operations, particularly in developing regions, are subject to various risks that may not be present
or as significant for our U.S. operations. Economic uncertainty in some of the geographic regions in
which we operate, including developing regions, could result in the disruption of commerce and
negatively impact cash flows from our operations in those areas.

Risks inherent in our international operations include:

   - non-U.S. currency exchange controls and tax rates;

   - non-U.S. currency exchange rate fluctuations, including devaluations;

   - the potential for changes in regional and local economic conditions, including local
inflationary pressures;

29


-----

   - restrictive governmental actions such as those on transfer or repatriation of funds and trade
protection matters, including antidumping duties, tariffs, embargoes and prohibitions or
restrictions on acquisitions or joint ventures;

   - changes in laws and regulations, including the laws and policies of the U.S. affecting trade
and foreign investment;

   - the difficulty of enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through certain non-U.S.
legal systems;

   - variations in protection of intellectual property and other legal rights;

   - more expansive legal rights of workers outside the U.S., unions or works councils;

   - changes in labor conditions and difficulties in staffing and managing international
operations;

   - import and export delays caused, for example, by an extended strike at the port of entry,
could cause a delay in our supply chain operations;

   - social plans and regulations that prohibit or increase the cost of certain restructuring
actions;

   - the potential for nationalization of enterprises or facilities; and

   - unsettled political conditions and possible terrorist attacks against the countries in which we
operate or other interests.

In addition, there are potential tax inefficiencies and tax costs in repatriating funds from the
various jurisdictions in which we do business.

These and other factors may have a material adverse effect on our international operations
and, consequently, on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.

**_Fluctuations between non-U.S. currencies and the U.S. dollar could materially impact our_**
**_consolidated financial condition or results of operations._**

Approximately 80% of our net sales during the year ended December 31, 2016 were
generated outside the United States. We translate sales and other results denominated in non-U.S.
currency into U.S. dollars for our combined financial statements included elsewhere in this offering
circular. As a result, we are exposed to currency fluctuations both in receiving cash from our
international operations and in translating our financial results back to U.S. dollars. During periods
of a strengthening U.S. dollar, our reported international sales and net income could be reduced
because non-U.S. currencies may translate into fewer U.S. dollars. We cannot predict the effects of
exchange rate fluctuations on our future operating results. As exchange rates vary, our results of
operations and profitability may be harmed. While we use financial instruments to hedge certain
non-U.S. currency exposures, this does not insulate us completely from non-U.S. currency effects
and exposes us to counterparty credit risk for non-performance. For more information, see our
combined financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this offering
circular. Such hedging activities may be ineffective or may not offset more than a portion of the
adverse financial effect resulting from non-U.S. currency variations. The gains or losses associated
with hedging activities may harm our results of operations.

In all jurisdictions in which we operate, we are also subject to laws and regulations that
govern non-U.S. investment, non-U.S. trade and currency exchange transactions. These laws and
regulations may limit our ability to repatriate cash as dividends or otherwise to the U.S. and may
limit our ability to convert non-U.S. currency cash flows into U.S. dollars.

30


-----

We have recognized non-U.S. exchange gains and losses related to the currency devaluations
in Venezuela and its designation as a highly inflationary economy under GAAP. For more
information, see our combined financial statements and the related notes thereto included
elsewhere in this offering circular.

**_Political and economic instability and risk of government actions affecting our business and_**
**_our customers or suppliers may adversely impact our business, results of operations and cash_**
**_flows._**

We are exposed to risks inherent in doing business in each of the countries or regions in
which we or our customers or suppliers operate, including: civil unrest, acts of terrorism, sabotage,
epidemics, force majeure, war or other armed conflict and related government actions, including
sanctions/embargoes, the deprivation of contract rights, the inability to obtain or retain licenses
required by us to operate our plants or import or export our goods or raw materials, the
expropriation or nationalization of our assets, and restrictions on travel, payments or the movement
of funds. In particular, if additional restrictions on trade with Russia were adopted by the EU or the
U.S., and were applicable to our products, we could lose sales and experience lower growth rates
in the future.

**_Raw material pricing, availability and allocation by suppliers as well as energy-related costs_**
**_may negatively impact our results of operations, including our profit margins and net sales._**

We use petrochemical-based raw materials to manufacture many of our products. The prices
for these raw materials are cyclical, and increases in market demand or fluctuations in the global
trade for petrochemical-based raw materials and energy could increase our costs. In addition, the
prices of many of the other key raw materials used in our businesses, such as caustic soda,
solvents, waxes, phosphates, surfactants, polymers and resins, chelates and fragrances, are cyclical
based on numerous supply and demand factors that are beyond our control. If we are unable to
minimize the effects of increased raw material costs through sourcing, pricing or other actions, our
business, consolidated financial condition or results of operations may be materially adversely
affected. We also have some sole-source suppliers, and the lack of availability of supplies could
have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.

Natural disasters such as hurricanes, as well as political instability and terrorist activities, may
negatively impact the production or delivery capabilities of refineries and natural gas and
petrochemical suppliers and suppliers of other raw materials in the future. These factors could lead
to increased prices for our raw materials, curtailment of supplies and allocation of raw materials by
our suppliers, which could reduce revenues and profit margins and harm relations with our
customers and which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition
or results of operations.

**_Unfavorable consumer responses to price increases could have a material adverse impact on_**
**_our sales and earnings._**

From time to time, and especially in periods of rising raw material costs, we increase the
prices of our products. Significant price increases could impact our earnings depending on, among
other factors, the pricing by competitors of similar products and the response by our customers to
higher prices. Such price increases may result in lower volume of sales and a subsequent decrease
in gross margin and adversely impact earnings.

31


-----

**_If we do not develop new and innovative products or if customers in our markets do not_**
**_accept them, our results would be negatively affected._**

Our products must be kept current to meet our customers’ needs, overcome competitive
products and meet evolving regulatory requirements. To remain competitive, we therefore must
develop new and innovative products on an on-going basis, and we invest significantly in the
research and development of new products. If we do not successfully develop innovative products,
it may be difficult to differentiate our products from our competitors’ products and satisfy regulatory
requirements, and our sales and results would suffer.

**_The introduction of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s (‘‘OECD’’)_**
**_Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (‘‘BEPS’’) may adversely affect our effective rate of tax in_**
**_future periods._**

In 2015, the OECD released various final reports under its BEPS action plan to reform the
international tax system to prevent tax avoidance and aggressive tax planning. The proposed
actions have a very broad scope including, but not limited to, neutralizing the effects of hybrid
mismatch arrangements, limiting base erosion involving interest deductions and other financial
payments, countering harmful tax practices, preventing the granting of treaty benefits in
inappropriate circumstances, and mandatory disclosure rules. The final reports give countries and
jurisdictions tools in order to implement new policies to prevent tax avoidance and aggressive tax
planning. Prospective investors should consult their own tax advisors on the impact of the BEPS’
final reports prior to making an investment decision in respect of the notes.

**_The introduction of the EU Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive and the amendments thereto may_**
**_adversely affect our effective rate of tax in future periods._**

On July 12, 2016, the European Council adopted Council Directive (EU) 2016/1164, commonly
referred to as the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive. The Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive provides for a
number of anti-abuse measures, inspired by the OECD BEPS project. The EU member states will in
principle have to implement the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive in their national legislation before
January 1, 2019. The Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive includes an earnings stripping rule that limits the
deduction of interest in case of certain excess financing levels, as well as rules targeting hybrid
mismatch arrangements within the EU. On May 29, 2017, the European Council adopted an
amendment to the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive, which inter alia extended the scope of the
anti-hybrid rules to non-EU situations which will need to be implemented as per January 1, 2020,
subject to certain exceptions. Prospective investors should consult their own tax advisors on the
impact of the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive and the amendments thereto prior to making an
investment decision in respect of the notes.

**_The consolidation of customers may adversely affect our business, consolidated financial_**
**_condition or results of operations._**

Customers in the food service, food and beverage processing building care, lodging, industrial
distribution and healthcare sectors have been consolidating in recent years, and we believe this
trend may continue. Such consolidation could have an adverse impact on the pricing of our
products and services and our ability to retain customers, which could in turn adversely affect our
business, consolidated financial condition or results of operations.

32


-----

**_We experience competition in the markets for our products and services and in the_**
**_geographic areas in which we operate._**

Our packaging products compete with similar products made by other manufacturers and with
a number of other types of materials or products. We compete on the basis of performance
characteristics of our products, as well as service, price and innovations in technology. A number of
competing domestic and non-U.S. companies are well-established.

The market for our hygiene products is highly competitive. Our hygiene products businesses
face significant competition from global, national, regional and local companies within some or all
of our product lines in each sector that we serve. Barriers to entry and expansion in the institutional
and industrial cleaning, sanitation and hygiene industry are low.

Our inability to maintain a competitive advantage could result in lower prices or lower sales
volumes for our products. Additionally, we may not successfully implement our pricing actions.
These factors may have an adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of
operations.

**_Instability and uncertainty in the credit and financial markets could adversely impact the_**
**_availability of credit that we and our customers need to operate our businesses._**

We depend upon the availability of credit to operate our business. Our customers and
suppliers also require access to credit for their businesses. Instability and uncertainty in the credit
and financial markets could adversely impact the availability of future financing and the terms on
which it might be available to us, our customers and our suppliers. Inability to access credit
markets, or a deterioration in the terms on which financing might be available, could have an
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_New and stricter legislation and regulations may affect our business and consolidated financial_**
**_condition and results of operations._**

Increased legislative and regulatory activity and burdens, and a more stringent manner in
which they are applied, could significantly impact our business and the economy as a whole. This
includes, among other things, the possible taxation under U.S. law of certain income from non-U.S.
operations. The regulatory environment is still developing, and the potential exists for future
legislation and regulations to be adopted. These developments, as well as the increasingly strict
regulatory environment, may also adversely affect the customers to which, and the markets into
which, we sell our products, increase our costs, require additional expenditures to ensure continued
regulatory compliance and otherwise negatively affect our business, consolidated financial condition
or results of operations, including in ways that cannot yet be foreseen.

**_Severe public health outbreaks may adversely impact our business._**

Our business could be adversely affected by the effect of a public health epidemic. The United
States and other countries have experienced, and may experience in the future, public health
outbreaks such as Zika virus, Avian Flu, SARS and H1N1 influenza. A prolonged occurrence of a
contagious disease such as these could result in a significant downturn in the foodservice,
hospitality and travel industries and also may result in health or other government authorities
imposing restrictions on travel further impacting our end-markets. Any of these events could result
in a significant drop in demand for some of our products and services and adversely affect our
business.

**_Our annual effective income tax rate can change materially as a result of changes in our mix_**
**_of U.S. and non-U.S. earnings and other factors, including changes in tax laws and changes_**
**_made by regulatory authorities._**

Our overall effective income tax rate is equal to our total tax expense as a percentage of total
earnings before tax. However, income tax expense and benefits are not recognized on a global
basis but rather on a jurisdictional or legal entity basis. Losses in one jurisdiction may not be used
to offset profits in other jurisdictions and may cause an increase in our tax rate. Changes in the mix
of earnings (or losses) between jurisdictions and assumptions used in the calculation of income
taxes, among other factors, could have a significant effect on our overall effective income tax rate.

**_We are subject to taxation in multiple jurisdictions. As a result, any adverse development in the_**
**_tax laws of any of these jurisdictions or any disagreement with our tax positions could have a_**
**_material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition or results of_**
**_operations._**

We are subject to taxation in, and to the tax laws and regulations of, multiple jurisdictions as a
result of the international scope of our operations and our corporate and financing structure. We are
also subject to transfer pricing laws with respect to our intercompany transactions, including those
relating to the flow of funds among our companies. Adverse developments in these laws or
regulations, or any change in position regarding the application, administration or interpretation
thereof, in any applicable jurisdiction, could have a material adverse effect on our business,
consolidated financial condition or results of our operations. In addition, the tax authorities in any
applicable jurisdiction, including the U.S. and the Netherlands, may disagree with the positions we
have taken or intend to take regarding the tax treatment or characterization of any of our
transactions. If any applicable tax authorities were to successfully challenge the tax treatment or
characterization of any of our transactions, it could have a material adverse effect on our business,
consolidated financial condition or results of our operations.

**_Our performance and prospects for future growth could be adversely affected if new products_**
**_do not meet sales or margin expectations._**

Our competitive advantage is due in part to our ability to develop and introduce new products
in a timely manner at favorable margins. The development and introduction cycle of new products
can be lengthy and involve high levels of investment. New products may not meet sales or margin
expectations due to many factors, including our inability to (i) accurately predict demand, end-user
preferences and evolving industry standards, (ii) resolve technical and technological challenges in a
timely and cost-effective manner or (iii) achieve manufacturing efficiencies.

**_A major loss of or disruption in our manufacturing and distribution operations or our_**
**_information systems and telecommunication resources could adversely affect our business,_**
**_consolidated financial condition or results of operations._**

If we experienced a natural disaster, such as a hurricane, tornado, earthquake or other severe
weather event, or a casualty loss from an event such as a fire or flood, at one of our larger strategic
facilities or if such event affected a key supplier, our supply chain or our information systems and
telecommunication resources, then there could be a material adverse effect on our consolidated
financial condition or results of operations. We are dependent on internal and third party information
technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to process, transmit and store electronic
information. In particular, we depend on our information technology infrastructure for fulfilling and
invoicing customer orders, applying cash receipts, and placing purchase orders with suppliers,
making cash disbursements, and conducting digital marketing activities, data processing and
electronic communications among business locations.

-----

We also depend on telecommunication systems for communications between company
personnel and our customers and suppliers. Future system disruptions, security breaches or
shutdowns could significantly disrupt our operations or result in lost or misappropriated information
and may have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition or results
of operations.

**_Product liability claims or regulatory actions could adversely affect our financial results or_**
**_harm our reputation or the value of our brands._**

Claims for losses or injuries purportedly caused by some of our products arise in the ordinary
course of our business. In addition to the risk of substantial monetary judgments, product liability
claims or regulatory actions could result in negative publicity that could harm our reputation in the
marketplace or adversely impact the value of our brands or our ability to sell our products in certain
jurisdictions. We could also be required to recall possibly defective products, or voluntarily do so,
which could result in adverse publicity and significant expenses. Although we maintain product
liability insurance coverage, potential product liabilities claims could be excluded or exceed
coverage limits under the terms of our insurance policies or could result in increased costs for such
coverage.

**_In the event we are unable to replace the products and related revenues associated with our_**
**_brand licensing agreement with SCJ, which expired this year, our business and results of_**
**_operations could be adversely affected._**

We reached a mutual agreement to end our existing business relating to our distribution of
SCJ-branded products under the brand licensing agreement with SCJ, which accounted for
approximately 3.8% of our net sales in 2016. The brand licensing agreement with SCJ expired in
May 2017 (with the exception of Australia, New Zealand, Argentina, Chile, Czech Republic and
Poland, where the brand licensing agreement expired on January 1, 2017). Although we are actively
engaged in efforts to replace these SCJ-branded products and the related revenues by, among
other things, developing new partnerships, expanding existing supplier relationships and growing
our brand into new channels, it is uncertain when and if we will be able to fully replace these
SCJ-branded products and/or the related revenues. In the event we are unable to do so, our results
of operations could be negatively impacted.

**_Our relationship with Unilever is important to our business and any damage to this relationship_**
**_could have a material adverse effect on our business._**

We are a party to various agreements with Unilever under which we are granted a license to
produce and sell professional size packs of Unilever’s consumer brand cleaning products in the
institutional and industrial channels of trade, which expire at the end of 2017 (with the exception of
a sub-set of the UK business which expire at the end of 2022). Although the term of these
agreements may be extended, it is uncertain on what terms and conditions these agreements may
be extended or if these agreements will be extended at all. In addition, we also hold licenses to use
some trademarks and technology of Unilever in the market for institutional and industrial cleaning,
sanitation and hygiene products and related services. If we default under our agreements with
Unilever and the agreements are terminated, Unilever fails to perform its obligations under these
agreements, or our relationship with Unilever terminates or is otherwise damaged or changed, this
could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition or results of
operations.

**_Economic conditions and regulatory changes following the U.K.’s likely exit from the European_**
**_Union could adversely impact our operations, operating results and financial condition._**

Following a referendum in June 2016, in which voters in the UK approved an exit from the EU,
the UK government initiated the formal process to leave the EU (often referred to as ‘‘Brexit’’) on
March 29, 2017. The process is expected to be completed within the next two years. The
referendum triggered short-term financial volatility, including a decline in the value of the British
pound sterling in comparison to both the U.S. dollar and euro. It is expected that Brexit will
continue to impact economic conditions in the EU. The future effects of Brexit will depend on any
agreements the UK makes to retain access to the EU or other markets either during a transitional
period or more permanently. Given the lack of comparable precedent, it is unclear what financial,
trade and legal implications the withdrawal of the UK from the EU would have and how such
withdrawal would affect our business. The consequences of Brexit, together with the significant
uncertainty regarding the terms on which the UK will leave the EU, could introduce significant
uncertainties into global financial markets and adversely impact the markets in which we and our
customers operate. Brexit could also create uncertainty with respect to the legal and regulatory
requirements to which we and our customers in the UK are subject and lead to divergent national
laws and regulations as the UK government determines which EU laws to replace or replicate.
While we are not experiencing any immediate adverse impact on our financial condition as a direct
result of Brexit, adverse consequences such as deterioration in economic conditions, volatility in
currency exchange rates or adverse changes in regulation could have a negative impact on our
future operations, operating results and financial condition. All of these potential consequences
could be further magnified if additional countries were to seek to exit the EU.

**_If we are unable to retain key employees and other personnel, our consolidated financial_**
**_condition or results of operations may be adversely affected._**

Our success depends largely on the efforts and abilities of our management team and other
key personnel. Their experience and industry contacts significantly benefit us, and we need their
expertise to execute our business strategies. If any of our senior management or other key
personnel cease to work for us and we are unable to successfully replace any departing senior
management or key personnel, our business, consolidated financial condition or results of
operations may be materially adversely affected.

**_As a result of the substantial workers council and labor union representation in certain_**
**_jurisdictions in which we operate, we experience a risk of disruptions in operations and/or_**
**_increased labor costs as well as reduced flexibility in managing our labor force._**

In Europe and Latin America, most of our employees are represented by either labor unions or
workers councils and are covered by collective bargaining agreements that are generally renewable
on an annual basis. As is the case with any negotiation, we may not be able to negotiate
acceptable new collective bargaining agreements, which could result in strikes or work stoppages
by affected workers. Renewal of collective bargaining agreements could also result in higher wages
or benefits paid to union members. A disruption in operations or higher ongoing labor costs could
materially affect our business.

In addition, in certain jurisdictions we are required to consult with, and seek the consent or
advice of, these labor unions or workers councils for any changes to our activities or employee
benefits. This requirement could have a significant impact on our flexibility in managing costs and
responding to market changes.

**_We are subject to a variety of environmental and product registration laws that expose us to_**
**_potential financial liability and increased operating costs._**

Our operations are subject to a number of federal, state, local and non-U.S. environmental,
health and safety laws and regulations that govern, among other things, the manufacture of our
products, the discharge of pollutants into the air, soil and water and the use, handling,
transportation, storage and disposal of hazardous materials.

Many jurisdictions require us to have operating permits for our production and warehouse
facilities and operations. Any failure to obtain, maintain or comply with the terms of these permits
could result in fines or penalties, revocation or nonrenewal of our permits, or orders to cease
certain operations, and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,
results of operations and cash flows.

We generate, use and dispose of hazardous materials in our manufacturing processes. In the
event our operations result in the release of hazardous materials into the environment, we may
become responsible for the costs associated with the investigation and remediation of sites at
which we have released pollutants, or sites where we have disposed or arranged for the disposal of
hazardous wastes, even if we fully complied with environmental laws at the time of disposal. We
have been, and may continue to be, responsible for the cost of remediation at some locations.

Some jurisdictions have laws and regulations that govern the registration and labeling of some
of our products. We expect significant future environmental compliance obligations in our European
operations as a result of an EU Directive ‘‘Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and Restriction of
Chemicals’’ (EU Directive No. 2006/1907) enacted on December 18, 2006. The directive imposes
several requirements related to the identification and management of risks related to chemical
substances manufactured or marketed in Europe. The EU has also recently enacted a
‘‘Classification, Packaging and Labeling’’ regulation. Other jurisdictions may impose similar
requirements.

We cannot predict with reasonable certainty the future cost to us of environmental compliance,
product registration, or environmental remediation. Environmental laws have become more stringent
and complex over time. Our environmental costs and operating expenses will be subject to evolving
regulatory requirements and will depend on the scope and timing of the effectiveness of
requirements in these various jurisdictions. As a result of such requirements, we may be subject to
an increased regulatory burden, and we expect significant future environmental compliance
obligations in our operations. Increased compliance costs, increasing risks and penalties associated
with violations, or our inability to market some of our products in certain jurisdictions may have a
material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition or results of operations.

**_Our insurance policies may not cover all operating risks and a casualty loss beyond the limits_**
**_of our coverage could adversely impact our business._**

Our business is subject to operating hazards and risks relating to handling, storing,
transporting and use of the products we sell. We maintain insurance policies in amounts and with
coverage and deductibles that we believe are reasonable and prudent. Nevertheless, our insurance
coverage may not be adequate to protect us from all liabilities and expenses that may arise from
claims for personal injury or death or property damage arising in the ordinary course of business,
and our current levels of insurance may not be maintained or available in the future at economical
prices. If a significant liability claim is brought against us that is not adequately covered by
insurance, we may have to pay the claim with our own funds, which could have a material adverse
effect on our business, consolidated financial condition or results of operations.

37

**_We may be exposed to liabilities under applicable anti-corruption laws and any determination_**
**_that we violated these laws could have a material adverse effect on our business._**

We are subject to various anti-corruption laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of
payments to non-U.S. governments and their officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining
business. We have business in countries and regions which are less developed and are generally
recognized as potentially more corrupt business environments. Activities in these countries create
the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by one of our employees or agents that
could be in violation of various anti-corruption laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the
‘‘FCPA’’). We have implemented safeguards and policies to discourage these practices by our
employees and agents. If our employees or agents violate our policies or we fail to maintain
adequate record-keeping and internal accounting practices to accurately record our transactions we
may be subject to regulatory sanctions. Violations of the FCPA or other anti-corruption laws may
result in severe criminal or civil sanctions and penalties, and we may be subject to other liabilities
which could adversely effect on our business, consolidated financial condition and results of
operations.

**_If we are not able to protect our trade secrets or maintain our trademarks, patents and other_**
**_intellectual property, we may not be able to prevent competitors from developing similar_**
**_products or from marketing their products in a manner that capitalizes on our trademarks, and_**
**_this loss of a competitive advantage could decrease our profitability and liquidity._**

Our ability to compete effectively with other companies depends, in part, on our ability to
maintain the proprietary nature of our owned and licensed intellectual property. If we were unable to
maintain the proprietary nature of our intellectual property and our significant current or proposed
products, this loss of a competitive advantage could result in decreased sales or increased
operating costs, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated
financial condition or results of operations.

We rely on trade secrets to maintain our competitive position, including protecting the
formulation and manufacturing techniques of many of our products. As such, we have not sought
U.S. or international patent protection for some of our principal product formulas and manufacturing
processes. Accordingly, we may not be able to prevent others from developing products that are
similar to or competitive with our products.

We own, or have licenses to, a large number of patents and pending patent applications on
our products, aspects thereof, methods of use and/or methods of manufacturing. There is a risk
that our owned and licensed patents may not provide meaningful protection and patents may never
be issued for our pending patent applications.

We own, or have licenses to use, the material trademark and trade name rights used in
connection with the packaging, marketing and distribution of our major products in the U.S. and in
other countries where our products are principally sold. Trademark and trade name protection is
important to our business. Although most of our trademarks are registered in the U.S. and in the
non-U.S. countries in which we operate, we may not be successful in asserting trademark or trade
name protection. In addition, the laws of some non-U.S. countries may not protect our intellectual
property rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S. The costs required to protect our
trademarks and trade names may be substantial.

We cannot be certain that we will be able to assert these intellectual property rights
successfully in the future or that they will not be invalidated, circumvented or challenged. Other
parties may infringe on or misappropriate our intellectual property rights and may thereby dilute the
value of our intellectual property in the marketplace. Third parties, including competitors, may assert
intellectual property infringement, misappropriation or invalidity claims against us that could be

38


-----

upheld. Intellectual property litigation, which could result in substantial cost to and diversion of
effort by us, may be necessary to protect our intellectual property rights, including trade secrets or
proprietary technology or for us to defend against claimed infringement or misappropriation of the
rights of others and to determine the scope and validity of our or others’ intellectual property or
proprietary rights. We may not prevail in any such litigation, and if we are unsuccessful, we may be
subject to monetary liability and injunctive or equitable relief, which may prevent our use of others’
intellectual property or proprietary rights if we are not be able to obtain necessary licenses on
reasonable terms or at all. Any failure by us to protect our trademarks and other intellectual
property rights may have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition
or results of operations.

**_Our products may infringe the intellectual property rights of others, which may cause us to_**
**_incur unexpected costs or prevent us from selling our products._**

We continually seek to improve our business processes and develop new products and
applications. Many of our competitors have a substantial amount of intellectual property that we
must continually strive to avoid infringing. Although it is our policy and intention not to infringe valid
patents of which we are aware, we cannot provide assurances that our processes and products
and other activities do not and will not infringe issued patents (whether present or future) or other
intellectual property rights belonging to others. There nonetheless could be third-party patents that
cover our products, processes or technologies, and it is possible that we could be liable for
infringement of such patents and could be required to take remedial or curative actions to continue
our manufacturing and sales activities with respect to one or more products that are found to be
infringing. We may also be subject to indemnity claims by our business partners arising out of
claims of their alleged infringement of the patents, trademarks and other intellectual property rights
of third parties in connection with their use of our products. Intellectual property litigation often is
expensive and time-consuming, regardless of the merits of any claim, and our involvement in such
litigation could divert our management’s attention from operating our business. If we were to
discover that any of our processes, technologies or products infringe on the valid intellectual
property rights of others, we might determine to obtain licenses from the owners of these rights or
to modify our processes or technologies or re-engineer our products in order to avoid infringement.
We may not be able to obtain the necessary licenses on acceptable terms, or at all, or be able to
modify our processes or technologies or re-engineer our products in a manner that is successful in
avoiding infringement. Moreover, if we are sued for infringement and lose, we could be required to
pay substantial damages and/or be enjoined from using or selling the infringing products or
technology. Any of the foregoing could cause us to incur significant costs and prevent us from
selling our products and could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of
operations.

**_Cyber risk and the failure to maintain the integrity of our operational or security systems or_**
**_infrastructure, or those of third parties with which we do business, could have a material_**
**_adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition and results of operations._**

We rely to a large extent upon information technology systems and infrastructure to operate
our business. The size and complexity of our information technology systems make them
increasingly vulnerable to breakdown, malicious intrusion and random attack, which may pose a
risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of
our data. Disruptions or failures in the physical infrastructure or operating systems that support our
businesses and customers, or cyber-attacks or security breaches of our networks or systems, could
result in the loss of customers and business opportunities, legal liability, regulatory fines, penalties
or intervention, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensatory costs, and additional
compliance costs, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, consolidated

39


-----

financial condition and results of operations. While we take reasonable measures to mitigate these
risks, our systems, networks, products, solutions and services remain potentially vulnerable to
advanced and persistent threats.

We also maintain and have access to sensitive, confidential or personal data or information in
certain of our businesses that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations and customer
controls. Despite our efforts to protect such sensitive, confidential or personal data or information,
our facilities and systems and those of our customers and third-party service providers may be
vulnerable to security breaches, theft, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors
that could lead to the compromising of sensitive, confidential or personal data or information,
improper use of our systems, software solutions or networks, unauthorized access, use, disclosure,
modification or destruction of information, defective products, production downtimes and
operational disruptions, which in turn could adversely affect our business and our results of
operations.

**_Our inability to consummate and effectively incorporate acquisitions into our business_**
**_operations may adversely affect our results of operations._**

We invest time and resources in carefully assessing opportunities for acquisitions, and we
continue to evaluate potential acquisition opportunities to support, strengthen and grow our
business, including potentially in the near-term. Despite diligence and integration planning,
acquisitions still present certain risks, including the time and economic costs of integrating an
acquisition’s technology, control and financial systems, unforeseen liabilities, and the difficulties in
bringing together different work cultures and personnel. Although we have completed many
acquisitions, there can be no assurance that we will be able to locate suitable acquisition
candidates, acquire possible acquisition candidates, acquire such candidates on commercially
reasonable terms, or integrate acquired businesses successfully in the future. Future acquisitions,
including those we may consummate in the near-term, may require us to incur additional debt and
contingent liabilities, which may adversely affect our business, results of operations and
consolidated financial condition. The process of integrating acquired businesses into our existing
operations may result in operating, contract and supply chain difficulties, such as the failure to
retain customers or management personnel. Such difficulties may divert significant financial,
operational and managerial resources from our existing operations, and make it more difficult to
achieve our operating and strategic objectives.

In addition, we may not be able to consummate acquisitions in the future on terms acceptable
to us, or at all. Future acquisitions are accompanied by the risk that the obligations and liabilities of
an acquired company may not be adequately reflected in the historical financial statements of that
company and the risk that those historical financial statements may be based on assumptions that
are incorrect or inconsistent with our assumptions or approach to accounting policies. Any of these
material obligations, liabilities or incorrect or inconsistent assumptions could adversely impact our
results of operations and financial condition.

**Risks Related to the Acquisition**

**_There are a number of risks and uncertainties associated with the Acquisition that could have_**
**_a material adverse impact on our business, consolidated financial condition and financial_**
**_results._**

There are a number of risks and uncertainties related to the Acquisition, including the
following:

   - uncertainties as to the timing of the Acquisition;

40


-----

   - the risk that the acquisition may not be completed in a timely manner or at all;

   - the possibility that any or all of the various conditions to the consummation of the
Acquisition may not be satisfied or waived;

   - the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstance that could give rise to the
termination of the Purchase Agreement;

   - the possibility of disruption to our business from the Acquisition, including the effect of the
announcement or pendency of the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement
on our ability to retain and hire key personnel, or our operating results and business
generally;

   - difficulties maintaining business and operational relationships, including relationships with
customers, suppliers, and other business partners because of the uncertainty relating to our
ability to perform contracts and the completion of the Acquisition;

   - risks related to diverting management’s attention and resources from ongoing business
operations;

   - risks related the unanticipated costs, charges and expenses resulting from the Acquisition;
and

   - developments beyond our control, including, but not limited to, changes in domestic or
global economic conditions that may affect the timing or success of the Acquisition.

**_The Acquisition is subject to a number of conditions which could delay or materially adversely_**
**_affect the timing of its completion, or prevent it from occurring._**

The Acquisition may not occur as a result of, among other things, one or more of the
Purchase Agreement’s closing conditions failing to occur or our failure to obtain sufficient financing
to complete the Acquisition. The Acquisition is subject to a number of other conditions beyond our
control that may prevent, delay or otherwise materially adversely affect its completion. We cannot
predict whether and when these conditions will be satisfied.

**_We have not operated as an independent company, and the historical and pro forma financial_**
**_information presented in this offering circular is not necessarily representative of the results_**
**_that we would have achieved as an independent company and may not be indicative of future_**
**_results._**

We have no recent operating history as an independent company. The historical and pro
forma financial information in this offering circular reflects our business as operated by Sealed Air
and is derived from the consolidated financial statements and accounting records of Sealed Air.
Accordingly, the combined carve-out financial statements may not reflect the Diversey business’
combined results of operations, financial position and cash flows had it been a stand-alone
company during the periods presented and may not be indicative of those that we will achieve
following the Transactions. Actual financial results that would have been incurred if the Diversey
business had been a stand-alone company would depend on multiple factors, including
organizational structure and strategic decisions made in various areas, including information
technology and infrastructure, due primarily to the following factors:

   - the Diversey business was historically operated by Sealed Air as part of its broader
corporate organization, rather than as an independent company. Sealed Air performed
various corporate functions for Diversey such as information technology, research and
development, accounting, human resources, legal, insurance and finance. Diversey’s
historical financial information reflects cost allocation for services historically provided by

41


-----

Sealed Air and we expect these allocations to be different from the costs we will incur for
these services in the future as a smaller independent company. As a result of Diversey’s
separation from Sealed Air, our costs related to such functions previously performed by
Sealed Air may be higher than the share of total Sealed Air expenses assessed to Diversey
historically;

   - Diversey’s historical combined financial information does not reflect our obligations under
the various transition and other agreements we will enter into with Sealed Air in connection
with the Acquisition, though costs under such agreements are expected to be broadly
similar to what was charged to the Diversey business in the past;

   - Diversey’s historical financial information does not reflect changes that we expect to
experience in the future as a result of the Transactions, including changes in our cost
structure, personnel needs, tax structure, financing and business operations. As part of
Sealed Air, we enjoyed certain benefits from its operating diversity, size, purchasing power,
our ability to secure favorable terms on our vendor contracts and available capital for
investments, and we will lose those benefits after the Transactions;

   - Diversey’s historical financial information does not reflect the debt and related interest
expense that we will incur as part of the Transactions;

   - Diversey’s working capital requirements and capital expenditures historically have been
satisfied as part of Sealed Air’s corporate-wide cash management and centralized funding
programs, and our cost of capital for our business may be higher than Sealed Air’s cost of
capital prior to the Transactions and significantly differ from that which is reflected in our
historical combined financial statements;

   - following the Acquisition, we may be more susceptible to economic downturns and other
adverse events than if we were still a part of Sealed Air; and

   - certain employees who have historically performed services for both the Diversey business
and for Sealed Air may not be employees of the Company after the Acquisition.

Additionally, the presentation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Further Adjusted EBITDA
contained in this offering circular is not made in accordance with GAAP or with a view towards
compliance with published guidelines of the SEC. We cannot assure you that any anticipated cost
savings will be achieved or that our estimates and assumptions will prove to be accurate. EBITDA,
Adjusted EBITDA and Further Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the significant costs we expect to
incur in order to achieve such cost savings, and there can be no assurance that such costs will not
be materially higher than presently contemplated. If our cost savings are less than our estimates or
our cost savings initiatives adversely affect our operations or cost more or take longer to implement
than we project, or if our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, our results will be lower than we
anticipate.

In addition, our pro forma financial information does not reflect what our financial condition or
results of operations would have been as an independent company and is not necessarily indicative
of our future financial condition or future results of operations. For additional information about the
past financial performance of the Diversey business and the basis of presentation of the historical
combined financial statements and unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements,
see ‘‘Summary—Summary Historical and Pro Forma Financial Data’’, ‘‘Unaudited Pro Forma
Condensed Combined Financial Information’’, ‘‘Selected Combined Historical Financial
Information’’, ‘‘Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations’’ and the audited and unaudited historical financial statements and accompanying notes
included elsewhere in this offering circular. In addition, since we historically operated as a business
of Sealed Air, the combined financial statements included in this offering circular have been

42


-----

prepared on a carve-out basis from Sealed Air, which requires certain assumptions and estimates
relating to, among other things, allocation of corporate services, non-U.S. currency exchange gains
and losses, interest expense, income taxes and other matters.

**_The pro forma financial information contained in this offering circular is preliminary and is_**
**_presented for illustrative purposes only and may not be an indication of our financial condition_**
**_or results of operations following the Transactions._**

Our operating results after the Transactions may be materially different from those shown in
the pro forma financial information presented throughout this offering circular, which does not
purport to represent what our financial position, results of operations or cash flows would actually
have been if the Transactions had occurred as of the dates indicated or what our financial position,
results of operations or cash flows would be for any future periods. The pro forma financial
statements contained in this offering circular are presented for illustrative purposes only, are based
on various adjustments, assumptions and preliminary estimates and may not be an indication of our
financial condition or results of operations following the Transactions for several reasons. Our actual
financial condition and results of operations following the Transactions may not be consistent with,
or evident from, these pro forma financial statements. In addition, the assumptions used in
preparing the pro forma financial information may not prove to be accurate, and other factors may
affect our financial condition or results of operations following the Transactions. The costs, fees and
expenses related to the Transactions could be higher than currently estimated. Further, because the
determination of fair value is dependent upon valuations that must be performed as of the date the
Acquisition is consummated, the valuations underlying the unaudited pro forma financial data
included in this offering circular may be revised after the date hereof. Any such adjustments to the
preliminary estimates of fair value could be material.

**_We may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of the Transactions, and the_**
**_Transactions may adversely affect our business._**

We believe that, as an independent company, we will be able to, among other matters, better
focus our financial and operational resources on our business, growth profile and strategic
priorities, design and implement corporate strategies and policies targeted to our operational focus
and strategic priorities, streamline our processes and infrastructure to focus on core strengths,
implement and maintain a capital structure designed to meet our specific needs and more
effectively respond to industry dynamics. Although on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the
Transactions, we currently estimate cost savings of approximately $55.0 million for the LTM Period,
including selling, general and administrative expense and procurement cost savings across our
organization that we believe can be realized by the end of 2018 following the consummation of the
Acquisition, actual cost savings could differ materially from our current expectations. Additionally,
we expect to incur approximately $35 million of related one-time costs over the next 12 to 18
months in order to achieve these savings. See ‘‘Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations—Effects of the Transactions—Estimated Cost Savings’’.

In connection with our evaluation of the Acquisition, we have estimated the costs we will need
to incur in order to operate as a standalone business after our transition services arrangements with
Sealed Air expire or are terminated. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully
realize the expected benefits of these initiatives. A variety of risks could cause us not to realize
some or all of the expected benefits or our estimated cost savings. These risks include the
establishment of stand-alone operations, creation of a new corporate structure, changes in
processes and information systems, dis-synergies from separation, potential client attrition and
changes to our operating model. Moreover, our continued implementation of these initiatives may
disrupt our operations and performance and our estimated cost savings from these initiatives are

43


-----

based on several assumptions that may prove to be inaccurate and, as a result, we cannot assure
you that we will realize these cost savings. These actions may not provide the expected benefits
and could lead to disruption of our operations, loss of or inability to recruit key personnel,
weakening of internal standards, controls or procedures and impairment of key customer and
supplier relationships.

Further, becoming an independent company will require significant amounts of management’s
time and effort, which may divert management’s attention from operating and growing our business.
If we fail to achieve some or all of the benefits that are expected to result from becoming an
independent company, or do not achieve them in the time frame expected, our business, financial
condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.

**_We may be unable to make, on a timely or cost-effective basis, the changes necessary to_**
**_operate as an independent company._**

We have historically operated as part of Sealed Air’s corporate organization, and Sealed Air
has assisted us by providing various corporate functions. Following the Acquisition, Sealed Air will
have no obligation to provide us with assistance other than the transition services described under
‘‘Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions—Transition Services Agreement’’. These
services do not include every service we have received from Sealed Air in the past, and Sealed Air
is only obligated to provide these services for limited periods from the date of the Acquisition.
Accordingly, following the Acquisition, we will need to provide internally or obtain from unaffiliated
third parties the services we currently receive from Sealed Air. These services include information
technology, research and development, finance, legal, insurance, compliance and human resources
activities, the effective and appropriate performance of which is critical to our operations. We may
be unable to replace these services in a timely manner or on terms and conditions as favorable as
those we receive from Sealed Air. In particular, Sealed Air’s information technology networks and
systems are complex, and duplicating these networks and systems will be challenging. Because
our business previously operated as part of the wider Sealed Air organization, we may be unable to
successfully establish the infrastructure or implement the changes necessary to operate
independently, or we may incur additional costs that could adversely affect our business. If we fail
to obtain the quality of administrative services necessary to operate effectively or incur greater costs
in obtaining these services, our profitability, consolidated financial condition and results of
operations may be materially and adversely affected.

**_To facilitate our transition to a standalone business, Sealed Air will provide a number of_**
**_services to us pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement. When such agreement_**
**_terminates, we will be required to replace the services, and the economic terms of the new_**
**_arrangements may be less favorable to us._**

In connection with the Acquisition, the Issuer and Sealed Air will enter into the Transition
Services Agreement, pursuant to which the Issuer and Sealed Air and their respective subsidiaries
will provide to each other, on an interim, transitional basis, various services. The services to be
provided by Sealed Air will include specified support services related to corporate functions such as
marketing and sales support, customer service, supply chain, purchasing, finance, information
systems services, environmental, health and safety, and general consulting for 12 months (or such
longer period and with such extensions as provided for pursuant to such agreement) following the
Acquisition, unless earlier terminated according to the terms of the agreement. When the Transition
Services Agreement terminates, we will be required to either enter into a new agreement with
Sealed Air or another services provider or assume the responsibility for these functions. We cannot
assure you that the economic terms of any new arrangements will be similar to those under the
Transition Services Agreement, or that the cost of us assuming responsibility for such functions will

44


-----

be comparable to the fees under the Transition Services Agreement. If we are unable to renew or
replace such arrangements on a comparable basis, our business, financial condition and results of
operations may be materially and adversely affected. For a summary of the material terms of the
Transition Services Agreement, see ‘‘Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions—
Transition Services Agreement’’.

**_Sealed Air’s historical and future actions, or failure to comply with its indemnification_**
**_obligations, may materially affect our business and operating results._**

Although we will be an independent company as a result of the Acquisition, Sealed Air’s
historical and future actions may still have a material impact on our business and operating results.
In connection with the Acquisition, we have entered into certain agreements with Sealed Air,
including the Purchase Agreement, the Transition Services Agreement, the License Agreement and
certain other commercial agreements. Sealed Air’s failure to comply with any portion of these
agreements, including indemnities therein, for any reason could inhibit us from operating or
expanding our business in the future and/or result in significant additional costs to us. For example,
if Sealed Air fails to provide necessary transitional and other commercial services, we may not be
able to operate our business effectively until we are able to perform these services on our own,
which may have a material impact on our operating results during that time. Additionally, pursuant
to the Purchase Agreement, Sealed Air has agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities. However,
third parties could also seek to hold us directly responsible for any of the liabilities that Sealed Air
has agreed to retain, and there can be no assurance that the indemnity from Sealed Air will be
sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities, or that Sealed Air will be able to
fully satisfy its indemnification obligations. We could incur material additional costs if Sealed Air fails
to meet its obligations or if we otherwise are unable to recover costs associated with such liabilities.
Further, there may be an adverse operational impact on our business as a result of the significant
management time and internal resources that will need to be dedicated to developing internal
support functions and standalone operations during the period following the Transactions. Such
management time and internal resources would otherwise be available for other business initiatives
and opportunities. Each of these risks could negatively affect our business, consolidated financial
position or results of operations.

**_Following the consummation of the Transactions, we will no longer receive capital_**
**_contributions from Sealed Air or have access to its assets or borrowing power. We may not be_**
**_able to raise additional funds when needed for our business or to exploit opportunities._**

To date, our primary sources of financing have been from Sealed Air. Following completion of
the Acquisition, Sealed Air will have no obligation to provide any additional financing to us, and we
will no longer have access to the borrowing capacity, cash flow or assets of Sealed Air, as the
Diversey business will be fully independent of Sealed Air after the Acquisition. Our future liquidity
and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors, some of which are outside our
control, including the future development of the markets in which we operate. We may need to
raise additional funds to support expansion, develop new or enhanced products and services,
respond to competitive pressures, acquire complementary businesses or technologies or take
advantage of unanticipated opportunities. If our capital resources are not sufficient to satisfy our
liquidity needs, we may, subject to compliance with the terms of the indenture that will govern the
notes and the credit agreement that will govern the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, seek to sell
additional debt or equity securities or obtain other debt financing. The incurrence of debt would
result in increased expenses and could include covenants that would further restrict our operations.
We have not made arrangements to obtain additional financing. We may not be able to obtain
additional financing, if required, in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, or at all.

45

**_Our business relationships, including customer relationships, may be subject to disruption due_**
**_to uncertainty associated with the Acquisition._**

Parties with which we currently do business or may do business in the future, including
customers and suppliers, may experience uncertainty associated with the Acquisition, including with
respect to current or future business relationships. As a result, our business relationships may be
subject to disruptions if customers, suppliers and others attempt to negotiate changes in existing
business relationships or consider entering into business relationships with parties other than us.
These disruptions could have a material and adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial
condition, results of operations or prospects. The effect of such disruptions could be exacerbated
by a delay in the consummation of the Acquisition.

**_We do not currently control Diversey and will not control Diversey until the consummation of_**
**_the Acquisition._**

We do not currently control Diversey and will not control Diversey until the consummation of
the Acquisition. While the Purchase Agreement imposes certain limitations on how Sealed Air
manages the Diversey business, we cannot assure you that, prior to the consummation of the
Acquisition, the Diversey business will be operated in the same way as it would be under our
control.

In addition, we expect to incur significant new indebtedness in connection with the
transactions, including the notes offered hereby and the loans under the Senior Secured Credit
Facilities. The debt we incur in connection with the Transactions may limit our financial and
operating flexibility, and we may incur additional debt, which could further restrict such flexibility
and increase the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness, including adverse material
consequences for our business, consolidated financial condition and results of operations.
See ‘‘—Risks Related to the Notes and Our Indebtedness’’.

**_After the Acquisition, certain of our executive officers may have actual or potential conflicts of_**
**_interest because of their equity interests in Sealed Air._**

Because of their former positions with Sealed Air, certain of our executive officers own and will
continue to own equity interests in Sealed Air. Even though our expected executive officers who are
currently employees of Sealed Air will cease to be employees of Sealed Air upon the separation,
continuing ownership of equity interests in Sealed Air by certain of our expected executive officers
could create, or appear to create, potential conflicts of interest if we and Sealed Air pursue the
same corporate opportunities or face decisions that could have different implications for us and
Sealed Air. Potential conflicts of interest could also arise if we enter into any new commercial
arrangements with Sealed Air in the future.

**_As a result of the Acquisition, we may not be able to retain key personnel or recruit additional_**
**_qualified personnel, which could materially adversely affect our business, consolidated_**
**_financial condition and results of operations and require us to incur substantial additional_**
**_costs to recruit replacement personnel._**

As a result of the Acquisition, our current and prospective employees could experience
uncertainty about their future roles. Uncertainty about the effect of the Transactions on employees,
customers and suppliers may have an adverse effect on the Company. These uncertainties may
impair our ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the Transactions are
consummated and for a period of time thereafter. If key employees depart because of issues related
to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with the Company, our

46


-----

business could be seriously harmed. Any failure to attract and retain key personnel could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_In connection with the Acquisition, we will assume potential liabilities relating to the Diversey_**
**_business. The assumption of unknown liabilities in the Acquisition may harm our financial_**
**_condition and results of operations._**

In connection with the Acquisition, we will have assumed potential liabilities relating to the
Diversey business, including contingent liabilities. If there are significant unknown Diversey
obligations, our business could be materially and adversely affected. We may learn additional
information about Diversey’s business that adversely affects our Company, such as unknown
liabilities, or issues that could affect our ability to comply with applicable laws. As a result, we
cannot assure you that the Acquisition will be successful or that it will not, in fact, harm our
business. Among other things, if Diversey’s liabilities are greater than expected, or if there are
material obligations of which we do not become aware until after the completion of the Acquisition,
our business could be materially and adversely affected. If we become responsible for substantial
uninsured liabilities, these liabilities may have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial
condition and results of operations. We have no recourse against Sealed Air (whether through
indemnity or otherwise) to cover any such liabilities.

**_Pursuant to the Acquisition, the Issuer will assume certain of Diversey’s existing pension plans_**
**_and will be responsible for any unfunded pension liabilities under such plans._**

The cash purchase price the Issuer will pay at closing will be reduced by the amount, if any,
that Diversey’s balance sheet pension liabilities exceed its balance sheet pension assets as of the
closing date of the Transactions, in each case, as calculated under GAAP using generally the same
plan provisions, actuarial assumptions and methods used as of December 31, 2016 in accordance
with the terms and conditions of the Purchase Agreement. There can be no assurance, however,
that the actuarial assumptions and methods to calculate the balance sheet value of such pension
assets and liabilities will accurately reflect the ultimate value of the pension plan liabilities assumed
by the Issuer or that any purchase price adjustment in respect of our pension obligations with fully
compensate the Issuer for any unfunded pension liability.

**_The transfer of certain assets related to the Diversey business is subject to certain consents,_**
**_approvals or permits from governmental authorities, including regulatory officials, and other_**
**_third parties, which may not be obtained at the closing of the Acquisition._**

Certain approvals, consents and permits from governmental authorities, including regulatory
officials, and other third parties are required in order to transfer certain assets related to the
Diversey business to us. The Purchase Agreement provides that the Issuer and Sealed Air and its
subsidiaries will cooperate to obtain such consents, approvals and permits. If these approvals,
consents or permits are not obtained as of the closing of the Acquisition, Sealed Air and its affiliates
will continue to operate these retained Diversey assets in the ordinary course of business and, to
the extent permitted by law, we will assume all obligations and liabilities and receive all benefits,
economic and otherwise, in respect of such retained assets. There can be no assurance that these
retained assets will be operated by Sealed Air in the same manner in which we would operate such
assets. In addition, there can be no assurance that all consents, approvals and permits will be
obtained, and in the event we fail to do so, our business and operating results may be materially
and adversely effected.

47


-----

**_In connection with the Acquisition, certain contracts will need to be renegotiated with third_**
**_parties or assigned from Sealed Air or its affiliates to us or from us to Sealed Air or its_**
**_affiliates, which will require the consent of the counterparty to such assignment, and any_**
**_failure to renegotiate or obtain these consents, as applicable, could increase our expenses or_**
**_otherwise reduce our profitability._**

The Purchase Agreement provides that a number of contracts are to be assigned from Sealed
Air or its affiliates to us or our affiliates or from us and our affiliates to Sealed Air or its affiliates.
Certain of these contracts require the counterparty’s consent to such assignment or will require us
to renegotiate the contracts with such counterparty. It is possible that some of these counterparties
may not provide such consent or may use the consent requirement to seek more favorable
contractual terms from us. If we are unable to obtain the consents or renegotiate the contracts, we
may be unable to obtain some or all of the benefits, assets and contractual commitments that are
intended to be allocated to us as part of the Acquisition. If we are unable to obtain these consents
or renegotiate the same terms, the loss of these contracts could adversely affect our business,
consolidated financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if we are unable to assign the
contracts to Sealed Air or its affiliates, we may remain bound and be liable under those contracts.
To the extent we need to renegotiate contracts with existing counterparties or enter into new
contracts with new counterparties, we cannot assure you that the economic terms of the new
arrangements will be similar to those under current arrangements. If we are unable to renew or
replace arrangements on a comparable basis, our business, consolidated financial condition and
results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.

**_Between the time of the issuance of the notes and the consummation of the Acquisition,_**
**_developments adverse to the Acquisition may occur, and the parties to the Purchase_**
**_Agreement may agree to modify or waive the terms or conditions of such document without_**
**_the consent of the holders of the notes._**

Your investment decision will be made at the time you purchase the notes and not at the
closing of the Acquisition, which is expected to occur in the second half of 2017. Accordingly, facts
and circumstances arising after your purchase of the notes, including changes in the business or
financial condition of Diversey or the terms of the Acquisition, will have no effect on your rights as a
holder of the notes, although they may have an adverse impact on the business or financial
condition of Diversey. Furthermore, the Transactions themselves have required and will likely
continue to require substantial amounts of management’s time and focus, which could adversely
affect their ability to operate the business. In addition, prior to the consummation of the Acquisition,
the parties to the Purchase Agreement may agree to amendments or waivers of the terms thereof.
Although the Escrow Agreement provides as a condition to the release of the escrowed funds that
the terms of the Purchase Agreement shall not have been amended in a manner adverse to the
holders of notes (subject to certain exceptions), that requirement will not preclude the transaction
parties from making certain changes to the terms of the Acquisition or from waiving conditions to
the Acquisition. See ‘‘Description of Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption’’.

**Risks Related to the Notes and Our Indebtedness**

**_Our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and prevent us_**
**_from fulfilling our obligations under the notes._**

After giving effect to the Transactions, we will have a significant amount of indebtedness,
which will require significant interest and principal payments. As of March 31, 2017, on a pro forma
basis after giving effect to the Transactions, we and our subsidiaries would have had approximately
$2,357.0 million of aggregate principal amount of indebtedness outstanding and an additional
$250.0 million of borrowing availability under our Revolving Credit Facility. No letters of credit are

48


-----

expected to be issued and outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility as of the date of the
consummation of the Transactions, but letters of credit, if issued, may be drawn after the closing
date of the Transactions or, subject to certain limitations, on such closing date. Our substantial level
of indebtedness increases the risk that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay
amounts due in respect of our indebtedness. Our substantial indebtedness could have other
important consequences to you and significant effects on our business. For example, it could:

   - make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the notes and our other
debt;

   - increase our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive
conditions;

   - require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to making
payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund
working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes;

   - limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in
which we operate;

   - require us to repatriate cash for debt service from our non-U.S. subsidiaries, resulting in
dividend tax costs, or require us to adopt other disadvantageous tax structures to
accommodate debt service payments;

   - restrict us from capitalizing on business opportunities;

   - make it more difficult to satisfy our financial obligations, including payments on the notes;

   - place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt;
and

   - limit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures,
acquisitions, debt service requirements, execution of our business strategy or other general
corporate purposes.

**_The Issuer’s assets consist primarily of investments in subsidiaries and the Issuer will depend_**
**_on distributions from its subsidiaries or other guarantors to fulfill its obligations under the_**
**_notes._**

The Issuer is a recently formed entity that is primarily a holding company and many of its
assets consist primarily of investments in its subsidiaries. We conduct a substantial portion of our
operations through our subsidiaries, certain of which are not guarantors of our indebtedness,
including the notes offered hereby. The Issuer’s ability to service its debt obligations, including its
ability to pay the interest on and principal of the notes when due, will be dependent upon cash
dividends and distributions or other transfers from its subsidiaries. Payments to the Issuer by its
subsidiaries or other guarantors will be contingent upon their respective earnings and subject to
any limitations on the ability of such entities to make payments or other distributions to us. The
Issuer’s subsidiaries and other guarantors are separate and distinct legal entities and have no
obligation, other than under their guarantee of the notes and guarantees of certain of the Issuer’s
other indebtedness, to make any funds available to the Issuer. Further, our subsidiaries may not be
able to, or be permitted to, make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our
indebtedness, including the notes. Under certain circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions
may limit the Issuer’s ability to obtain cash from its subsidiaries. The indenture that will govern the
notes offered hereby and the credit agreement that will govern the Senior Secured Credit Facilities
will limit the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to pay dividends and make other intercompany
payments to us, subject to certain exceptions. In the event that the Issuer does not receive

49


-----

distributions from its subsidiaries, the Issuer may be unable to make required principal and interest
payments on its indebtedness, including the notes.

**_Despite our indebtedness level following the Transactions, we may still be able to incur_**
**_substantially more debt. This could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial_**
**_leverage._**

We may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. Although the credit
agreement that will govern the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the indenture that will govern
the notes will contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are
subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, and the indebtedness that may be incurred in
compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. If we incur additional debt above the levels
that will be in effect on the closing date after giving effect to the Transactions, the risks associated
with our leverage, including those described above, would increase. The Senior Secured Credit
Facilities will provide aggregate availability of up to approximately $1,800 million under the Term
Loan Facility, all of which will be drawn at closing to finance the Transactions. In addition, as of
March 31, 2017, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions, we would have had an
additional $250.0 million of availability under the Revolving Credit Facility. No letters of credit are
expected to be issued and outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility as of the date of the
consummation of the Transactions, but letters of credit, if issued, may be drawn after the closing
date of the Transactions or, subject to certain limitations, on such closing date. Further, the
restrictions in the indenture that will govern the notes and the credit agreement that will govern the
Senior Secured Credit Facilities will not prevent us from incurring obligations, such as trade
payables, that do not constitute indebtedness as defined in such debt instruments.

Any additional debt may be governed by indentures or other instruments containing covenants
that could place restrictions on the operation of our business and the execution of our business
strategy in addition to the restrictions on our business already contained in the credit agreement
that will govern the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the indenture that will govern the notes.
Because any decision to issue debt securities or enter into new debt facilities will depend on
market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount,
timing or nature of any future debt financings and whether we may be required to accept
unfavorable terms for any such financings.

**_To service our indebtedness, we will require a significant amount of cash. Our ability to_**
**_generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control, and any failure to meet our debt_**
**_service obligations may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of_**
**_operations._**

Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness, including the notes, and
to fund working capital needs and planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to
generate cash in the future. This, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial,
competitive, business, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. We
cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future
borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to service our debt, including
the notes, to refinance our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs. After giving effect to the
Transactions, substantially all of our debt, including the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, will mature
before the maturity date of the notes.

If our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operations or if future borrowings
are not available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness, including the
notes, or to fund our other liquidity needs, we may need to restructure or refinance all or a portion
of our indebtedness, including the notes, on or before the maturity thereof, sell assets, reduce or

50


-----

delay capital investments or seek to raise additional capital, any of which could have a material
adverse effect on our operations. In addition, we may not be able to effect any of these actions, if
necessary, on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Our ability to restructure or refinance our
indebtedness, including the notes, will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our
financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and
may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business
operations. The terms of existing or future debt instruments, including the indenture that will govern
the notes, may limit or prevent us from taking any of these actions. Further, the credit agreement
that will govern the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the indenture that will govern the notes offered
hereby and the agreements governing our accounts receivable securitization programs will restrict
our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from those dispositions. We may not be able
to consummate those dispositions or to obtain the proceeds therefrom in an amount sufficient to
meet any debt service obligations then due. In addition, any failure to make scheduled payments of
interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness would likely result in a reduction of our
credit rating, which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness on commercially
reasonable terms or at all. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt service
obligations, or to refinance or restructure our obligations on commercially reasonable terms or at
all, may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as our
ability to satisfy our obligations in respect of the notes.

Moreover, in the event of a default, the holders of our indebtedness, including the notes, could
elect to declare all the funds borrowed to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid
interest, if any. The lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility could also elect to terminate their
commitments thereunder, cease making further loans, and institute foreclosure proceedings against
their collateral, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. If we breach our covenants
under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, we would be in default thereunder. The lenders could
exercise their rights, as described above, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.

**_The indenture that will govern the notes and the credit agreement that will govern the Senior_**
**_Secured Credit Facilities will restrict our current and future operations, particularly our ability_**
**_to respond to certain changes or to take certain actions._**

The indenture that will govern the notes and the credit agreement that will govern the Senior
Secured Credit Facilities will impose significant operating and financial restrictions and limit the
ability of us and our restricted subsidiaries to:

   - incur additional indebtedness and guarantee indebtedness;

   - pay dividends or make other distributions in respect of, or repurchase or redeem, capital
stock;

   - prepay, redeem or repurchase certain debt;

   - make loans and investments;

   - sell or otherwise dispose of assets;

   - sell stock of our subsidiaries;

   - incur liens;

   - enter into transactions with affiliates;

   - enter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends; and

   - consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets.

51


-----

As a result of these covenants and restrictions, we are and will be limited in how we conduct
our business, and we may be unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to compete
effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities. In addition, we will be required to
maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy other financial condition tests. The terms of any future
indebtedness we may incur could include more restrictive covenants. We cannot assure you that
we will be able to maintain compliance with these covenants in the future and, if we fail to do so,
that we will be able to obtain waivers from the lenders and/or amend the covenants.

Our failure to comply with the restrictive covenants described above as well as others
contained in our future debt instruments from time to time could result in an event of default, which,
if not cured or waived, could result in our being required to repay these borrowings before their
maturity. If we are forced to refinance these borrowings on less favorable terms or cannot refinance
these borrowings, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.

**_A decline in our operating results or available cash could cause us to experience difficulties in_**
**_complying with covenants contained in more than one debt agreement, which could result in_**
**_our bankruptcy or liquidation._**

If we were to sustain a decline in our operating results or available cash, we could experience
difficulties in complying with the financial covenant contained in the credit agreement that will
govern the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. The failure to comply with such covenant could result in
an event of default under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and by reason of cross-acceleration
or cross-default provisions, other indebtedness may then become immediately due and payable. In
addition, should an event of default occur, the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility could
elect to terminate their commitments thereunder, cease making loans and institute foreclosure
proceedings against our assets, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. If our
operating performance declines, we may in the future need to obtain waivers from the required
lenders under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities to avoid being in default. If we breach our
covenants under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and seek a waiver, we may not be able to
obtain a waiver from the required lenders. If this occurs, we would be in default under the Senior
Secured Credit Facilities, the lenders could exercise their rights, as described above, and we could
be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. Further, any event of default or declaration of acceleration
under one debt instrument could also result in an event of default under one or more of our other
debt instruments.

**_Our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our_**
**_indebtedness service obligations to increase significantly._**

Interest rates may increase in the future. As a result, interest rates on the Senior Secured
Credit Facilities or other variable rate debt offerings could be higher or lower than current levels. As
of March 31, 2017, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions, we would have had
approximately $1,775.3 million of outstanding debt at variable interest rates. In addition, as of
March 31, 2017, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions, we would have had an
additional $250.0 million of availability at variable interest rates under the Revolving Credit Facility.
No letters of credit are expected to be issued and outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility
as of the date of the consummation of the Transactions; however, letters of credit may be drawn
thereunder after the closing date or, subject to certain limitations, on the closing date. If interest
rates increase, our debt service obligations on our variable rate indebtedness would increase even
though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income and cash flows, including
cash available for servicing our indebtedness, would correspondingly decrease. A 0.125% increase
in the expected rate of interest under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities would increase our
annual interest expense by approximately $2.2 million.

52


-----

**_Prior to or when the Senior Secured Credit Facilities mature, we may not be able to refinance_**
**_or replace them._**

The Senior Secured Credit Facilities have an earlier maturity date than the notes. Prior to or
when the Senior Secured Credit Facilities mature, we may need to refinance them and may not be
able to do so on favorable terms or at all. If we are able to refinance maturing indebtedness, the
terms of any refinancing or alternate credit arrangements may contain terms and covenants that
restrict our financial and operating flexibility. If we are unable to refinance the Senior Secured Credit
Facilities prior to or when they mature it could result in an event of default under the credit
agreement that will govern the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. Moreover, the occurrence of an
event of default under the credit agreement that will govern the Senior Secured Credit Facilities
could result in an event of default under our other indebtedness, including the indenture that will
govern the notes.

**_From and after the Escrow Release Date, the notes will be unsecured and effectively_**
**_subordinated to our secured indebtedness, including the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, to_**
**_the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness._**

Our obligations under the notes will be unsecured and will be effectively subordinated to our
secured indebtedness, to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such secured
indebtedness. Borrowings under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities will be secured by
substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and any existing and future guarantors, including all of
the issued and outstanding equity interests of the Issuer and each wholly-owned restricted
subsidiary directly owned by the Issuer or any guarantor (which, in the case of non-U.S.
subsidiaries, will be limited to 65% of the issued and outstanding equity interests of each direct or
indirect restricted subsidiary of the Issuer), subject to the restrictions of the laws of the jurisdiction
of organization of each guarantor.

If an event of default occurs under the agreements governing our secured indebtedness,
including the credit agreement that will govern the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the holders of
such senior secured indebtedness will have a prior right to our secured assets, to the exclusion of
the holders of the notes, even if we are in default with respect to the notes. In that event, our
secured assets would first be used to repay in full all indebtedness and other obligations secured
by them (including all amounts outstanding under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities), resulting in
all or a portion of such assets being unavailable to satisfy the claims of the holders of the notes
and other unsecured indebtedness. Therefore, in the event of any distribution or payment of our
assets in any foreclosure, dissolution, winding-up, liquidation, reorganization, or other bankruptcy
proceeding, holders of the notes will participate in our remaining assets ratably with each other and
with all holders of our other indebtedness that is deemed to be of the same class as such notes,
and potentially with all of our other general creditors, based upon the respective amounts owed to
each holder or creditor. In any of the foregoing events, we cannot assure you that there will be
sufficient assets to pay amounts due on the notes. As a result, holders of such notes may receive
less, ratably, than holders of secured indebtedness.

**_Claims of holders of the notes will be structurally subordinated to claims of creditors of_**
**_certain of the Issuer’s subsidiaries that will not guarantee the notes._**

The notes will not be guaranteed by certain of our existing and future subsidiaries. As of the
Escrow Release Date, only Holdings and the Issuer’s existing and subsequently acquired or
organized direct and indirect material wholly-owned restricted subsidiaries that guarantee
indebtedness under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities (other than those organized in Italy) will
guarantee the notes. The timing of providing the guarantees will be subject to the laws of the
jurisdiction of each guarantor, as applicable. Claims of holders of the notes will be structurally

53


-----

subordinated to the claims of creditors of these non-guarantor subsidiaries, including trade
creditors, and will not be satisfied from the assets of these non-guarantor subsidiaries until their
creditors are paid in full. For the LTM Period, the Diversey subsidiaries that will not guarantee the
notes represented approximately 37.1% and 45.9% of Diversey’s consolidated net sales and
consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, respectively. As of March 31, 2017, those non-guarantor
subsidiaries accounted for approximately 34.7% of Diversey’s total assets (excluding assets not
being acquired in the Transactions).

In addition, the guarantee of certain guarantors will be released in connection with a transfer
of such guarantor in a transaction not prohibited by the indenture that will govern the notes or upon
certain other events described in ‘‘Description of Notes—Note Guarantees’’.

The indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby will permit the Issuer’s non-guarantor
subsidiaries to incur certain additional debt and will not limit their ability to incur other liabilities that
are not considered indebtedness thereunder.

**_The Issuer may be unable to repurchase the notes upon a change of control._**

Upon the occurrence of specified kinds of change of control events, the Issuer will be required
to offer to repurchase all outstanding notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the
notes, together with accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase. However, it is possible
that we will not have sufficient funds at the time of the change of control to make the required
repurchase of the notes. If the Issuer is required to repurchase the notes, we would probably
require third-party financing. We cannot be sure that we would be able to obtain third party
financing on acceptable terms, or at all. The Issuer’s failure to offer to purchase all outstanding
notes or to purchase all validly tendered notes would be an event of default under the indenture
that will govern the notes. Such an event of default may cause the acceleration of our other debt,
including debt under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. Our future debt also may contain
restrictions on repayment requirements with respect to specified events or transactions that
constitute a change of control under the indenture that will govern the notes.

It is also possible that the events that constitute a change of control may also be events of
default under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities. These events may permit the lenders under the
Senior Secured Credit Facilities to accelerate the indebtedness outstanding thereunder. If we are
required to repurchase the notes pursuant to a change of control offer and repay certain amounts
outstanding under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities if such indebtedness is accelerated, we
would probably require third-party financing. We cannot be sure that we would be able to obtain
third-party financing on acceptable terms, or at all. If the indebtedness under the Senior Secured
Credit Facilities is not paid, the lenders thereunder may seek to enforce security interests in the
collateral securing such indebtedness, thereby limiting our ability to raise cash to purchase the
notes, and reducing the practical benefit of the offer to purchase provisions to the holders of the
notes. Any future debt agreements may contain similar provisions.

**_Holders of notes may not be able to determine when a change of control giving rise to their_**
**_right to have the notes purchased has occurred following a sale of ‘‘substantially all’’ of our_**
**_assets._**

One of the circumstances under which a change of control may occur is upon the sale or
disposition of all or substantially all of our assets. However, the phrase ‘‘all or substantially all’’ will
likely be interpreted under applicable state law and will be dependent upon particular facts and
circumstances. As a result, there may be a degree of uncertainty in ascertaining whether a sale or
disposition of ‘‘all or substantially all’’ of our capital stock or assets has occurred, in which case,
the ability of a holder of the notes to obtain the benefit of an offer to repurchase all of a portion of

54


-----

the notes held by such holder may be impaired. See ‘‘Description of Notes—Change of Control’’
and ‘‘Description of Notes—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary
Stock’’.

**_We can enter into transactions like recapitalizations, reorganizations and other highly_**
**_leveraged transactions that do not constitute a change of control but that could adversely_**
**_affect the holders of the notes._**

Certain important corporate events, such as leveraged recapitalizations, may not, under the
indenture that will govern the notes, constitute a ‘‘change of control’’ that would require the Issuer
to offer to purchase the notes, notwithstanding the fact that such corporate events could increase
the level of our indebtedness or otherwise adversely affect our capital structure, credit ratings or the
value of the notes. Therefore, we could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including
acquisitions, reorganizations, refinancings or other recapitalizations, which would not constitute a
change of control under the indenture that will govern the notes, but that could increase the
amount of indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit
ratings.

**_An investment in the notes by a holder whose home currency is not euro entails significant_**
**_risks._**

All payments of interest on and the principal of the notes and any redemption price for the
notes will be made in euro. An investment in the notes by a holder whose home currency is not
euro entails significant risks. These risks include the possibility of significant changes in rates of
exchange between the holder’s home currency and euro and the possibility of the imposition or
subsequent modification of non-U.S. exchange controls. These risks generally depend on factors
over which we have no control, such as economic, financial and political events and the supply of
and demand for the relevant currencies. In the past, rates of exchange between the euro and
certain currencies have been highly volatile, and each holder should be aware that volatility may
occur in the future. Fluctuations in any particular exchange rate that have occurred in the past,
however, are not necessarily indicative of fluctuations in the rate that may occur during the term of
the notes. In addition, if one or more member states were to withdraw from the European Monetary
Union and cease to use the euro as their currency, the value of the euro could be materially
adversely affected. Depreciation of the euro against the holder’s home currency would result in a
decrease in the effective yield of the notes below their coupon rate and, in certain circumstances,
could result in a loss to the holder. See ‘‘Exchange Rates’’.

If you are a holder subject to U.S. income tax, see ‘‘Certain Income Tax Considerations—
Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations—U.S. Holders’’ for the material U.S. federal income
tax consequences of the acquisition, ownership and disposition of the notes related to the notes
being denominated in euro.

**_In a lawsuit for payment on the notes, an investor may bear currency exchange risk._**

The notes and the indenture that will govern the notes will be governed by the laws of the
State of New York. Under New York law, a New York state court rendering a judgment on the notes
would be required to render the judgment in euros. The judgment would be converted into U.S.
dollars, however, at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of entry of the judgment.
Consequently, in a lawsuit for payment on the notes, investors whose home currency is not euros
would bear currency exchange risk until a New York state court judgment is entered, which could
be a significant amount of time. A U.S. federal court sitting in New York with diversity jurisdiction
over a dispute arising in connection with the notes would apply the foregoing New York law. To the
extent that a judgment is ordered in U.S. dollars, an investor would be subject to exchange risk on

55


-----

the amount they receive in euros due to variation in the exchange rate between the time of
judgment and the time of collection.

In courts outside of New York, investors may not be able to obtain a judgment in a currency
other than U.S. dollars. For example, a judgment for money in an action based on the notes in
many other U.S. federal or state courts ordinarily would be enforced in the United States only in
U.S. dollars. The indenture that will govern the notes includes an indemnity by the Issuer against a
deficiency due to any such judgment, but there can be no assurance that such indemnity will be
enforced. The date used to determine the rate of conversion of euros into U.S. dollars would
depend upon various factors, including which court renders the judgment and when the judgment
is rendered.

**_The lenders under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities will have the discretion to release any_**
**_guarantor under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities in a variety of circumstances, which will_**
**_cause such guarantor to be released from its guarantee of the notes._**

While any obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities remain outstanding, a
guarantor’s guarantee of the notes may be released without action by, or consent of, any holder of
the notes or the trustee under the indenture that will govern the notes, at the discretion of the
lenders under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, if the guarantor no longer guarantees obligations
under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities or any other indebtedness. See ‘‘Description of Notes—
Note Guarantees’’. The lenders under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities will have the discretion to
release the guarantees under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities in a variety of circumstances. You
will not have a claim as a creditor against any subsidiary that is no longer a guarantor of the notes,
and the indebtedness and other liabilities, including trade payables, whether secured or unsecured,
of those non-guarantor subsidiaries will be structurally senior to claims of noteholders.

**_Many of the covenants in the indenture that will govern the notes will not apply to us if the_**
**_notes are rated investment grade by either Moody’s or S&P._**

Many of the covenants in the indenture that will govern the notes will cease to apply to the
notes during such time, if any, as the notes are rated investment grade by both Moody’s and S&P,
provided that at such time no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing. Although
there can be no assurance that the notes will ever be rated investment grade, or if they are rated
investment grade, that the notes will maintain these ratings, any suspension of the covenants under
the indenture that will govern the notes would allow us to engage in certain transactions that would
not be permitted while these covenants were in effect. Such transactions may impair our ability to
satisfy our obligations with respect to the notes. To the extent any suspended covenants are
subsequently reinstated, any actions taken by us while the covenants were suspended would not
result in an event of default under the indenture that will govern the notes on the basis that such
actions would have been prohibited by the covenants. See ‘‘Description of Notes—Certain
Covenants—Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status’’.

**_Ratings of the notes may affect the market price and marketability of the notes._**

The notes offered hereby will have a non-investment grade rating on the issue date. Credit
rating agencies continually revise their ratings for the companies that they follow, including us.
Credit rating agencies also evaluate our industry as a whole and may change their credit ratings for
us based on their overall view of our industry. These ratings are limited in scope and do not
address all material risks relating to an investment in the notes, but rather reflect only the view of
each rating agency at the time the rating is issued. An explanation of the significance of such rating
may be obtained from such rating agency. There is no assurance that such credit ratings will
remain in effect for any given period of time or that such ratings will not be lowered, suspended or

56


-----

withdrawn entirely by the ratings agencies if, in each rating agency’s judgment, circumstances so
warrant. It is also possible that such ratings may be lowered in connection with the application of
the proceeds of this offering or in connection with future events, such as future acquisitions.
Holders of notes will have no recourse against us or any other parties in the event of a change in
or suspension or withdrawal of such ratings. Credit ratings are not recommendations to purchase,
hold or sell the notes, and may be revised or withdrawn at any time. Additionally, credit ratings may
not reflect the potential effect of risks relating to the structure or marketing of the notes. Any
lowering, suspension or withdrawal of such ratings may have an adverse effect on the market price
or marketability of the notes.

**_Holders of the notes will not be entitled to registration rights, and we do not currently intend_**
**_to register the notes under applicable securities laws. There are restrictions on your ability to_**
**_transfer or resell the notes._**

The notes are being offered and sold pursuant to an exemption from registration under the
Securities Act and applicable U.S. state securities laws, and we do not currently intend to register
the notes. The holders of the notes will not be entitled to require us to register the notes for resale
or otherwise. Therefore, you may transfer or resell the notes in the United States only in a
transaction registered under or exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and
applicable U.S. state securities laws, and you may be required to bear the risk of your investment
for an indefinite period of time. See ‘‘Transfer Restrictions’’.

**_Your ability to transfer the notes may be limited by the absence of an active trading market,_**
**_and an active trading market may not develop for the notes._**

The notes will be a new issue of securities for which there is no established trading market. An
application has been made by or on behalf of the Issuer to the Authority for the listing of and
permission to deal in the notes on the Official List of the Exchange. There is no assurance that the
notes will be listed on the Official List of the Exchange, that such permission to deal in the notes
will be granted or that such listing will be maintained. The initial purchasers of the notes have
advised us that they intend to make a market in the notes as permitted by applicable laws and
regulations. However, the initial purchasers are not obligated to make a market in the notes, and, if
commenced, they may discontinue their market-making activities at any time without notice.

Therefore, an active market for the notes may not develop or be maintained, which would
adversely affect the market price and liquidity of the notes. In that case, the holders of the notes
may not be able to sell their notes at a particular time or at a favorable price. The liquidity of any
market for the notes will depend on a number of factors, including:

   - the number of holders of notes;

   - our operating performance and financial condition;

   - the market for similar securities;

   - the interest of securities dealers in making a market in the notes;

   - prevailing interest rates; and

   - the aggregate principal amount of notes outstanding.

Even if an active trading market for the notes does develop, there is no guarantee that it will
continue. Historically, the market for non-investment grade debt has been subject to severe
disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to the notes. The
market, if any, for the notes may experience similar disruptions, and any such disruptions may
adversely affect the liquidity in that market or the prices at which you may sell your notes. In

57


-----

addition, subsequent to their initial issuance, the notes may trade at a discount from their initial
offering price, depending upon prevailing interest rates, the market for similar notes, our
performance and other factors.

**_There are restrictions on transfer on your ability to transfer or resell the notes._**

The notes are being offered and sold pursuant to an exemption from registration under the
Securities Act and applicable state securities laws. Therefore, you may transfer or resell the notes in
the United States only in a transaction registered under or exempt from the registration
requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws, and you may be required to
bear the risk of your investment for an indefinite period of time. The Issuer is not obligated to
register the notes under the Securities Act or to offer to exchange the notes in an exchange offer
registered under the Securities Act. As a result, for so long as the notes remain outstanding, they
may be transferred or resold only in transactions exempt from the registration requirements of
federal and applicable state securities laws.

**_The notes may not become, or remain, listed on the Exchange._**

Although an initial application has been made by or on behalf of the Issuer to the Authority for
the listing of and permission to deal in the notes on the Official List of the Exchange, there can be
no assurance that the notes will be listed on the Official List of the Exchange, that such permission
to deal in the notes will be granted or that such listing will be maintained.

**_The indenture that will govern the notes will not be qualified under the Trust Indenture Act and_**
**_we will not be required to comply with the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act._**

The indenture that will govern the notes will not be qualified under the Trust Indenture Act and
we will not be required to comply with the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act. Therefore, holders
of the notes will not be entitled to the benefit of the provisions and protection of the Trust Indenture
Act except to the extent there are similar provisions in the indenture that will govern the notes.

**_We are controlled by Bain Capital, whose interests may not be aligned with ours or yours._**

Investment funds owned by Bain Capital will beneficially own a substantial majority of our
outstanding equity interests. As a result, such funds are in a position to control all matters affecting
us, including decisions regarding extraordinary business transactions, fundamental corporate
transactions, appointment of members of our management, election of directors and our corporate
and management policies. The interests of the funds affiliated with Bain Capital could conflict with
your interests. For example, if we encounter financial difficulties or are unable to pay our debts as
they mature, the interests of such funds might conflict with your interests as a holder of the notes.
Bain Capital may also have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures, financings or other
transactions that, in their judgment, could enhance their equity investments, even though such
transactions might involve risks to you as a holder of the notes.

**_You may be unable to enforce judgments against the Issuer, the guarantors or our respective_**
**_directors and officers._**

Neither the Issuer nor most of the guarantors are incorporated in the United States. In
addition, most of our assets are outside the United States and certain of the Issuer’s directors and
officers live outside the United States. Although the Issuer and the guarantors will submit to the
jurisdiction of certain New York courts in connection with any action under U.S. securities laws, it
may be difficult or impossible to serve process against any of these persons in the United States.
Furthermore, because a substantial part of the assets of these persons are located outside of the

58


-----

United States, it may not be possible to enforce judgments obtained in courts in the United States
predicated upon civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States against
these persons. Additionally, there is doubt as to the enforceability in many non-U.S. jurisdictions of
civil liabilities based on the civil liability provisions of the federal or state securities laws of the
United States against the Issuer, the guarantors, the directors, controlling persons and management
and any experts named in this offering circular who are not residents of the United States. Please
see ‘‘Enforceability of Judgments’’.

**_The notes will initially only be issued in global certificated form and held through Euroclear_**
**_and Clearstream and unless and until the notes are issued in definitive registered form in_**
**_exchange for book entry interests, owners of book entry interest will not be considered_**
**_owners or holders of the notes._**

The notes will initially only be issued in global certificated form and held through Euroclear
and Clearstream. Interests in the Global Notes (as such term is defined in ‘‘Book Entry, Delivery
and Form for the Notes’’) will trade in book-entry form only. Unless and until the notes in definitive
registered form are issued in exchange for book entry interests, owners of book entry interests will
not be considered owners or holders of the notes. The common depositary (or its nominee) for the
accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream will be the registered holder of the Global Notes. Payments
in respect of the Global Notes representing the notes (including principal, premium, interest and
additional amounts, if any) will be made to the paying agent. The paying agent will then make such
payments to the common depositary (or its nominee) for Euroclear and Clearstream. The common
depositary (or its nominee) will in turn distribute such payments to participants in accordance with
its procedures. After payment to the common depositary (or its nominee), we, the trustee and the
paying agent will have no responsibility or liability for the payment of interest, principal or other
amounts to the owners of book entry interests. Accordingly, if you own a book entry interest, you
must rely on the procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, and if you are not a
participant in Euroclear or Clearstream, on the procedures of the participant through which you own
your interest, to exercise any rights and obligations of a holder of notes under the indenture that
will govern the notes. See ‘‘Book Entry, Delivery and Form for the Notes’’.

Unlike the holders of the notes themselves, owners of book entry interests will not have the
direct right to act upon our solicitations for consents, requests for waivers or other actions from
holders of the notes. Instead, if you own a book entry interest, you will be permitted to act only to
the extent you have received appropriate proxies to do so from Euroclear or Clearstream or, if
applicable, a participant. There can be no assurance that procedures implemented for the granting
of such proxies will be sufficient to enable you to vote on any request actions on a timely basis.

Similarly, upon the occurrence of an event of default under the indenture that will govern the
notes, unless and until notes in definitive registered form are issued in respect of all book entry
interests, if you own a book entry interest, you will be restricted to acting through Euroclear or
Clearstream. We, the trustee and the paying agent cannot assure you that the procedures to be
implemented through Euroclear or Clearstream will be adequate to ensure the timely exercise of
rights under the notes. See ‘‘Book Entry, Delivery and Form for the Notes’’.

**_Insolvency proceedings and fraudulent transfer laws concerning the Issuer or any of the_**
**_guarantors in the United States or certain non-U.S. jurisdictions may adversely affect a_**
**_recovery by the holders of the notes._**

In the event that the Issuer, any guarantor or any of the Issuer’s other subsidiaries or affiliates
were to experience financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction
or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, the outcome of such
proceedings, or whether the insolvency laws of such jurisdiction would be favorable to your

59


-----

interests. The commencement of an insolvency proceeding by or against the Issuer or a guarantor
in the United States or certain non-U.S. jurisdictions in which the Issuer or a guarantor is organized
may adversely affect a recovery by the holders of the notes. See ‘‘Limitations on the Validity and
Enforceability of Guarantees and Certain Insolvency Considerations’’ for summaries of the
limitations on recovery in such jurisdictions.

**_Enforcing your rights as a holder of the notes or under the guarantees across multiple_**
**_jurisdictions may prove difficult or provide less protection than U.S. bankruptcy law._**

The notes will be issued by the Issuer, a company incorporated under the laws of the
Netherlands. The notes will be guaranteed by the guarantors, which we expect will include material
wholly-owned entities incorporated or organized under the laws of Australia, Austria, Brazil,
Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Mexico, the Netherlands, Poland,
Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States (subject to customary
limitations). In the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency or similar event, proceedings could be initiated
in any, all or any combination of the above jurisdictions. Such jurisdictions may not be as favorable
to investors as the laws of the United States or other jurisdictions with which investors are familiar,
and proceedings in these jurisdictions are likely to be complex and costly for creditors and
otherwise may result in greater uncertainty and delay regarding the enforcement of your rights. Your
rights in and under the notes and the guarantees will be subject to the bankruptcy, insolvency and
administrative laws of the relevant jurisdictions and there can be no assurance that you will be able
to effectively enforce your rights in such complex, multiple bankruptcy, insolvency or similar
proceedings. See ‘‘Limitations on the Enforceability of Guarantees and Certain Insolvency
Considerations’’ and ‘‘Enforceability of Judgements’’.

In addition, in the event that one or more of the Issuer, the guarantors and any future
guarantor, if any, or any other of our subsidiaries experiences financial difficulty, the bankruptcy,
insolvency, administrative and other laws of the Issuer’s and the guarantors’ jurisdictions of
organization and location of assets may be materially different from, or in conflict with, each other
and those of the United States, including in the areas of rights of creditors, contractual
subordination, priority of governmental and other creditors, ability to obtain post-petition interest
and duration of the proceedings. The application of these laws, or any conflict among them, could
call into question whether the law of any particular jurisdiction should apply, and may adversely
affect your ability to enforce your rights under the notes and the guarantees.

Although laws differ among various jurisdictions, in general, under bankruptcy or insolvency
law and other laws, a court could (i) avoid or invalidate all or a portion of a guarantor’s obligations
under its guarantee, (ii) direct that the holders of the notes return any amounts paid under a
guarantee to the relevant guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of the guarantor’s creditors or
(iii) take other action that is detrimental to you, typically if the court found that:

   - the relevant guarantee was incurred with actual intent to give preference to one creditor over
another, hinder, delay or defraud creditors or shareholders of the relevant guarantor or, in
certain jurisdictions, when the granting of the guarantee has the effect of giving a creditor a
preference or when the recipient was aware that the relevant guarantor was insolvent when
it granted the relevant guarantee;

   - the relevant guarantor did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value or
corporate benefit for the relevant guarantee and such guarantor was: (i) insolvent or
rendered insolvent because of the relevant guarantee; (ii) undercapitalized or became
undercapitalized because of the relevant guarantee; or (iii) intended to incur, or believed that
it would incur, indebtedness beyond its ability to pay at maturity;

60


-----

   - the relevant guarantee was held to exceed the corporate objects of the guarantor or not to
be in the best interests or for the corporate benefit of the guarantor or was executed in the
absence of corporate approvals required under the applicable law; or

   - the amount paid or payable under the relevant guarantee was in excess of the maximum
amount permitted under applicable law.

These or similar laws may also apply to any future guarantee granted by any of our
subsidiaries pursuant to the indenture that will govern the notes.

We cannot assure you which standard a court would apply in determining whether a guarantor
was ‘‘insolvent’’ at the relevant time or that, regardless of the method of valuation, a court would
not determine that a guarantor was insolvent on that date, or that a court would not determine,
regardless of whether or not a guarantor was insolvent on the date its guarantee was issued, that
payments to holders of the notes constituted preferences, fraudulent transfers or fraudulent
conveyances on other grounds. The measures of insolvency for purposes of fraudulent transfer
laws vary depending upon applicable governing law. Generally, an entity would be considered
insolvent if, at the time it incurred indebtedness:

   - the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, is greater than the fair value of all its
assets;

   - the present fair saleable value of its assets is less than the amount required to pay the
probable liability on its existing debts and liabilities, including contingent liabilities, as they
become due; or

   - it cannot pay its debts as they become due.

**_Each guarantor’s liability under its guarantees may be reduced to zero, voided or released_**
**_under certain circumstances, and holders of notes may not receive any payments from some_**
**_or all of the guarantors._**

The guarantors will guarantee the notes on a senior unsecured basis. Each guarantee will
provide the holders of the notes with a direct claim against the relevant guarantor. However, each
guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed by the relevant guarantor
without rendering the relevant guarantee voidable or otherwise ineffective under applicable law, and
enforcement of each guarantee will be subject to certain generally available defenses. These laws
and defenses include those that relate to corporate benefit, fraudulent conveyance or transfer,
voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose, capital maintenance or similar laws, as
well as regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally. As a result, a guarantor’s
liability under its guarantee could be reduced to zero, depending upon the amount of other
obligations of such guarantor. See ‘‘Limitations on the Enforceability of Guarantees and Certain
Insolvency Considerations’’. In addition, you will lose the benefit of a particular guarantee if it is
released under certain circumstances described under ‘‘Description of Notes—Note Guarantees’’.

**Risks Related to the Escrow of Proceeds**

**_In the event that the Acquisition is not consummated on or prior to the Outside Date and the_**
**_other Escrow Release Conditions are not satisfied, the notes will be subject to a Special_**
**_Mandatory Redemption and, as a result, you may not obtain the return you expect on the_**
**_notes._**

This offering will be consummated prior to the consummation of the Acquisition.
Consequently, concurrently with the consummation of the offering, the Issuer will enter into the
Escrow Agreement with the trustee and the Escrow Agent. Pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, on

61


-----

the closing date of this offering the Issuer will deposit (or cause to be deposited) the gross
proceeds of this offering into the Escrow Account.

Pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, the release of the escrowed funds will be subject to the
satisfaction of the Escrow Release Conditions, including the closing of the Acquisition. If the
Acquisition is not consummated on or prior to the Outside Date, or upon the occurrence of certain
other events, the notes will be subject to a Special Mandatory Redemption at the Special
Mandatory Redemption Price in accordance with the terms of the indenture that will govern the
notes. Upon such Special Mandatory Redemption, you may not be able to invest the proceeds
therefrom in an investment that yields returns comparable to the notes. In addition, if you purchase
the notes at a price greater than the issue price of the notes, you may suffer a loss on your
investment.

The escrowed funds will be initially limited to the gross proceeds of this offering and will not
be sufficient to pay the Special Mandatory Redemption Price, which is equal to the aggregate
principal amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, from
the issue date to, but excluding, the redemption date. In the event that the escrowed funds are
insufficient to pay the Special Mandatory Redemption Price, the Bain Capital Fund will be required
to transfer an amount of cash in euro to enable the Issuer to pay the Special Mandatory
Redemption Price in full.

**_If the Issuer commences a bankruptcy or reorganization case or one is commenced against_**
**_the Issuer in the United States, federal bankruptcy laws may prevent the release of the_**
**_escrowed funds._**

If the Issuer commences a bankruptcy or reorganization case, or one is commenced against
the Issuer, while amounts remain in the Escrow Account, applicable U.S. bankruptcy laws may
prevent the Escrow Agent from releasing the funds in the Escrow Account or applying those funds
to effect a Special Mandatory Redemption of the notes or otherwise applying those funds for the
benefit of the holders of the notes. The court adjudicating that case might find that the Escrow
Account is the property of the bankruptcy estate. Although the amounts in the Escrow Account will
be pledged as collateral for payment, if required, of the Special Mandatory Redemption Price, the
automatic stay provisions of the federal bankruptcy laws generally prohibit secured creditors from
foreclosing upon or disposing of a debtor’s property without bankruptcy court approval. As a result,
holders of the notes may not be able to have the funds in the Escrow Account applied at the time
or in the manner contemplated by the indenture that will govern the notes and could suffer a loss
as a result.

In addition, if the court adjudicating the Issuer’s bankruptcy or reorganization case finds that
the escrowed funds are property of the bankruptcy estate, the court could authorize the use of
these funds by the bankruptcy estate or the bankruptcy trustee, if one is appointed, with or without
restrictions. As a result, the holders of the notes could become unsecured creditors of the
bankruptcy estate. In such event, the only remedy available to the holders of the notes would be to
sue for payment on the notes.

**_If an insolvency case is commenced against the Issuer in the Netherlands, Dutch insolvency_**
**_law may prevent the release of the escrowed funds._**

If the Issuer becomes the subject of bankruptcy proceedings (faillissement) or suspension of
payments (surseance van betaling) is granted, while amounts remain in the Escrow Account,
applicable Dutch insolvency laws may prevent the Escrow Agent from releasing the funds in the
Escrow Account or applying those funds to effect a Special Mandatory Redemption of the notes or
otherwise applying those funds for the benefit of the holders of the notes. As a result, holders of the

62


-----

notes may not be able to have the funds in the Escrow Account applied at the time or in the
manner contemplated by the indenture that will govern the notes and could suffer a loss as a
result. A liquidator (curator) or an administrator (bewindvoerder) may find that the escrowed funds
are the property of the bankruptcy estate. As a result, the holders of the notes would be left with
only an unsecured claim in the bankruptcy estate. See ‘‘Limitations on the Enforceability of
Guarantees and Certain Insolvency Considerations—The Netherlands’’.

**_Until the consummation of the Transactions, the Issuer will have limited assets and the_**
**_Issuer’s subsidiaries, including those subsidiaries to be acquired by the Issuer pursuant to the_**
**_Acquisition, will not guarantee the notes or be subject to the restrictive covenants in the_**
**_indenture that will govern the notes._**

On the issue date the notes will be issued solely by the Issuer and will not be guaranteed.
Prior to the consummation of the Transactions, holders of the notes will not have any recourse to
the Issuer’s subsidiaries, including those subsidiaries to be acquired by the Issuer pursuant to the
Acquisition. Prior to the Escrow Release Date, holders of the notes will only have (i) a first priority
security interest in any interest the Issuer may be deemed to have in the Escrow Account and the
funds held therein and (ii) a right to receive the funds held in the Escrow Account if the Escrow
Release Conditions are not satisfied, as described under ‘‘Description of Notes—Escrow of
Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption’’. The Issuer does not conduct any material operations
and will have limited assets (except for the Issuer’s interest in the Escrow Account) until the
consummation of the Transactions. As a result, in the event of a bankruptcy of the Issuer prior to
the consummation of the Transactions, holders of the notes will have a secured claim as to the
funds deposited into the Escrow Account and an unsecured claim as to any other assets of the
Issuer, such that the sole recourse of the holders of the notes prior to such time will be to the
escrowed funds.

Prior to the Escrow Release Date, the Issuer’s subsidiaries, including those subsidiaries to be
acquired by the Issuer pursuant to the Acquisition, will not be subject to the restrictive covenants in
the indenture that will govern the notes. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, Sealed Air will be
required to operate Diversey in the ordinary course of business prior to the consummation of the
Acquisition. We cannot assure you that Diversey will be operated during this interim period in the
same way that Diversey would be operated by the Issuer.

**USE OF PROCEEDS**

We expect the net proceeds from this offering will be approximately $ million, after
deducting the initial purchasers’ discounts and commissions. We converted the net proceeds of this
offering of e545.0 million aggregate principal amount of euro dominated senior notes into
U.S. dollars using the, 2017 exchange rate of e1.00=$ . As further described in
the table and the accompanying footnotes below, upon release from escrow, we intend to use the
proceeds from the issuance and sale of the notes offered hereby, together with the borrowings
under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the Equity Contribution, to (i) finance the Acquisition
and (ii) pay fees and expenses in connection with the Transactions.

The following table illustrates the estimated sources and uses of funds for the Transactions.
Actual amounts could vary from estimated amounts depending on several factors, including
changes in the cash purchase price for Diversey based on any change in the amount of estimated
cash and working capital of Diversey at closing and changes in our actual amount of expenses
related to the Transactions. You should read the following together with the information included
under the headings ‘‘Summary—The Transactions’’ and ‘‘Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed
Combined Financial Information’’ included elsewhere in this offering circular.

(1) The Revolving Credit Facility is expected to be undrawn upon the completion of the Transactions. However, at closing
we may draw (x) up to $40.0 million to fund acquisition and transaction costs, (y) amounts to pay certain OID or
upfront fees, if any, and (z) additional amounts to fund working capital needs (including purchase price adjustment
payments owed under the Purchase Agreement). See ‘‘Summary—The Transactions’’ and ‘‘Description of Certain

offered hereby will be denominated in euro in an aggregate principal amount of e545.0 million, or $599.5 million using
an exchange rate of e1.00=$1.1000, which takes into account that in connection with the Transactions, we entered
into a foreign currency forward contract to fix the amount receivable with respect to (x) the euro-denominated tranche
of the Term Loan Facility and (y) the notes offered hereby, which such forward contract fixed the euro-to-dollar
exchange rate at the rate then in effect at the signing of the Purchase Agreement.

(4) Represents the approximate Equity Contribution to be made by investment funds advised by Bain Capital.

(5) The cash purchase price to be paid at closing is subject to certain adjustments set forth in the Purchase Agreement
based on estimated and actual working capital, cash and indebtedness of Diversey at closing. If necessary, we expect
to pay any increases in the equity purchase price with borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, subject to the
limitations set forth in note (1) above.

(6) Reflects estimated fees and expenses associated with the Transactions, commitment, placement and other financing
fees, financial advisory costs and other transaction costs and professional fees. We expect any fees and expenses in

(1) Certain subsidiaries of Diversey are borrowers under the delayed draw Term Loan A tranche of Sealed Air’s
senior secured credit facilities. Our prepayments related to this Term Loan A Facility are included in the
current portion of the long-term debt. The release of the obligations of (and liens on) Diversey under Sealed
Air’s senior secured credit facilities will be completed prior to the consummation of the Acquisition. For
information with respect to Sealed Air’s senior secured credit facilities and Diversey’s borrowings thereunder,
see the notes to our audited combined financial statements included elsewhere in this offering circular.

(2) The Senior Secured Credit Facilities are expected to consist of (i) the approximately $1,800 million Term Loan
Facility, consisting of a $900.0 million U.S. dollar denominated tranche and an e820.0 million
euro-denominated tranche or approximately $875.3 million using an exchange rate of e1.00=$1.0674 as of
March 31, 2017 and (ii) the $250.0 million Revolving Credit Facility. The amount outstanding under the Term
Loan Facility is presented before giving effect to estimated issuance costs of approximately $53.5 million, for
a total balance of $1,775.3 million. Using an exchange rate of $1.1000 (which takes into account that in
connection with the Transactions, we entered into a foreign currency forward contract to fix the amount
receivable with respect to (x) the euro-denominated tranche of the Term Loan Facility and (y) the notes
offered hereby, which such forward contract fixed the euro-to-dollar exchange rate at the rate then in effect at
the signing of the Purchase Agreement), the aggregate principal amount of the euro-denominated tranche of
the Term Loan Facility would be $902.0 million. The Revolving Credit Facility is expected to be undrawn upon
the completion of the Transactions. However, at closing we may draw (x) up to $40.0 million to fund
acquisition and transaction costs, (y) amounts to pay certain OID or upfront fees, if any, and (z) additional
amounts of fund working capital needs (including purchase price adjustment payments owed under the
Purchase Agreement). As of March 31, 2017, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions, we
would have had $250.0 million of availability under the Revolving Credit Facility. No letters of credit are
expected to be issued and outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility as of the date of the
consummation of the Transactions, but letters of credit, if issued, may be drawn after the closing date of the
Transactions or, subject to certain limitations, on such closing date. See ‘‘Summary—The Transactions’’ and
‘‘Description of Certain Other Indebtedness’’.

(3) Represents the aggregate principal amount of the notes offered hereby, before giving effect to estimated
issuance costs of approximately $14.6 million. The notes offered hereby will be denominated in euro in an
aggregate principal amount of e545.0 million, or approximately $581.7 million using an exchange rate of
e1.00=$1.0674 as of March 31, 2017. Using an exchange rate of $1.1000 (which takes into account that in
connection with the Transactions, we entered into a foreign currency forward contract to fix the amount
receivable with respect to (x) the euro-denominated tranche of the Term Loan Facility and (y) the notes
offered hereby, which such forward contract fixed the euro-to-dollar exchange rate at the rate then in effect at
the signing of the Purchase Agreement), the aggregate principal amount of the notes offered hereby would
be $599.5 million.

(4) Total debt excludes $20.6 million of short-term borrowings outstanding under various lines of credit.

(5) Sealed Air’s investment in us is presented in our combined financial statements as a net investment in lieu of
stockholders’ equity because no direct ownership relationship existed among the entities that comprise the
Diversey business.

(6) Represents the approximate Equity Contribution to be made by investment funds advised by Bain Capital. In
the event that the estimated net working capital is lower than the target net working capital, the equity
purchase price will be reduced on a dollar-for-dollar basis. We will either retain the excess cash, reduce the
Equity Contribution, or a combination of the two, as we deem appropriate, in the event of any decrease in
the equity purchase price due to this adjustment. The equity purchase price will also be reduced on a
dollar-for-dollar basis by the estimated amount of any outstanding indebtedness and certain unpaid fees and
expenses of the Transactions, in each case prior to closing. The amount of our pro forma invested equity will
be increased or decreased, as applicable, on a dollar-for-dollar basis to reflect any changes in the actual
amount of the fees and expenses payable on account of the Transactions from the estimated amount other
than with respect to fees and expenses of the type to be funded by borrowings under the Revolving Credit
Facility. Pro forma stockholders’ equity includes the portion of the estimated fees and expenses that do not
relate to the issuance of debt, as well as an estimated settlement gain on the forward contract in connection
with entry into the Term Loan Facility and the issuance of the notes offered hereby and a loan commitment
fee related to the bridge financing, net of their respective estimated tax deductions. These amounts have
been calculated as if the Transactions occurred on March 31, 2017. Actual amounts will differ based on the
actual expenses incurred and the deductibility of such costs, as well as the exchange rates in effect at
closing.

**UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION**

We derived the following unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements by
applying pro forma adjustments to our historical combined financial statements appearing
elsewhere in this offering circular.

For purposes of this offering circular, the Transactions were accounted for using the
acquisition method of accounting in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board
(‘‘FASB’’) Accounting Standard Codification (ASC) Topic 805, Business Combinations, which we
refer to as ASC 805, with the Issuer treated as the accounting acquirer in the Transaction. The
historical consolidated financial information has been adjusted in the unaudited pro forma
condensed combined financial statements to give effect to pro forma events that are (1) directly
attributable to the Transactions, (2) factually supportable, and (3) with respect to the statements of
operations, expected to have a continuing impact on the results of operations. Although the parties
have entered into the Purchase Agreement, there is no guarantee that the Acquisition will be
completed.

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet data gives effect to the
Transactions as if they had occurred on March 31, 2017. The unaudited pro forma condensed
combined statement of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and for the fiscal
year ended December 31, 2016 and the associated pro forma adjustments give effect to the
Transactions as if they had occurred on January 1, 2016. The unaudited pro forma condensed
combined statement of operations data for the LTM Period has been derived by adding the
historical combined statement of operations data for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 to
the historical combined statement of operations data for the three months ended March 31, 2017,
subtracting the historical combined statement of operations data for the three months ended
March 31, 2016 and applying the pro forma adjustments to give effect to the Transactions as if they
had occurred on January 1, 2016. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial
statements were prepared in accordance with GAAP and pursuant to SEC Regulation S-X Article 11,
and present the pro forma financial position and results of operations of the consolidated
companies based upon the historical information, after giving effect to the Transactions, and the
adjustments described in the subsequent footnotes. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined
financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars.

We describe the assumptions underlying the pro forma adjustments in the accompanying
notes, which should be read in conjunction with these unaudited pro forma condensed combined
financial statements. We operated as a business unit/division of Sealed Air and not as a stand-alone
entity for each of the historical financial periods used in the preparation of these unaudited pro
forma condensed combined financial statements. Following the completion of the Transactions, we
expect to be able to perform certain back-office functions and other services with respect to our
international operations previously provided to us by Sealed Air on a more cost effective basis than
the amounts that have been allocated to us in each of these historical financial periods. We have
not made any adjustments in these unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements
to reflect any of these expected cost-savings as these types of adjustments may not be permitted
under the SEC’s rules and regulations regarding the preparation of pro forma financial statements
included in a registration statement filed under the Securities Act.

The pro forma adjustments related to the business combination accounting and financing of
the Transactions are preliminary and based on information obtained to date and are subject to
revision as additional information becomes available. The business combination accounting rules,
as described in the accompanying notes, require us to record the identifiable assets acquired and
liabilities assumed at their fair value as of the closing date of the Transactions and may differ from
those reflected in these unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements. Revisions

to the preliminary business combination accounting and financing of the Transactions may have a
significant impact on the pro forma amounts of total assets, total liabilities and equity, general and
administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization, interest expense and income taxes.

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements should not be considered
indicative of actual results that would have been achieved had the Transactions been consummated
on the date or for the periods indicated and do not purport to indicate consolidated balance sheet
data or results of operations as of any future date or for any future period.

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements should be read in
conjunction with the information contained in ‘‘Summary—The Transactions’’, ‘‘Selected Historical
Combined Financial Data’’, ‘‘Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations’’ and the audited and unaudited combined financial statements and the
respective accompanying notes appearing elsewhere in this offering circular.

**NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED BALANCE SHEET**

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of March 31, 2017 includes
the unaudited pro forma adjustments described below:

(a) The pro forma adjustments set forth above adjust our historical financial statements to reflect
the terms of the Purchase Agreement under which Sealed Air will retain certain assets and
liabilities of the Company. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet has
been prepared assuming that all of the asset transfers contemplated by the Purchase
Agreement were completed as of March 31, 2017. In certain foreign jurisdictions, Sealed Air
may not be able to finalize certain asset transfers prior to the actual closing date of the
principal components of the Acquisition. In that event, we have agreed with Sealed Air to
cooperate to satisfy such requirements as promptly as practicable following the closing date
and Sealed Air has agreed that it will continue to operate our businesses in the ordinary
course for our benefit. In addition, until such asset transfers are completed, Sealed Air has
agreed to pay to Holdings an amount equal to the after tax net income (as defined in the
Purchase Agreement), and we have agreed to pay to Sealed Air an amount equal to the after
tax net loss (as defined in the Purchase Agreement), in each case, generated by Diversey in
any applicable jurisdiction for which transfer was delayed. If any asset transfer does not occur
within eighteen months following the closing date of the Acquisition, Sealed Air will pay us the
applicable portion of the purchase price of Diversey for the applicable jurisdiction, which will
be calculated in accordance with the terms of the Purchase Agreement, and all obligations
with respect to such jurisdictions will terminate. See ‘‘Summary—The Transactions—The
Acquisition’’.

(b) The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet reflects the incurrence of debt,
contribution of equity, payment of the Acquisition purchase price and the payment of fees and
expenses in connection with the Transactions as if they had occurred on March 31, 2017, as
follows:

(1) The Revolving Credit Facility is expected to be undrawn upon the completion of the Transactions. However, at
closing we may draw (x) up to $40.0 million on the Revolving Credit Facility to (i) fund acquisition and
transaction costs and (ii) pay fees and expenses related to the Transactions, including any OID or upfront fees,
if any, and (y) additional amounts to fund working capital needs (including working capital payments under the
Purchase Agreement). See ‘‘Summary—The Transactions’’ and ‘‘Description of Certain Other Indebtedness’’.

(2) Represents (i) a $900.0 million U.S. dollar denominated tranche and (ii) an e820.0 million euro-denominated
tranche, or approximately $1,775.3 million using an exchange rate of e1.00=$1.0674 as of March 31, 2017.

(3) Represents the aggregate principal amount of the notes offered hereby, excluding any offering discount. The
notes offered hereby will be denominated in euro in an aggregate principal amount of e545.0 million, or
approximately $581.7 million using an exchange rate of e1.00=$1.0674 as of March 31, 2017.

(4) Represents the approximate Equity Contribution to be made by investment funds advised by Bain Capital.

(5) In connection with the Transactions, we entered into a foreign currency forward contract. This amount
represents the proceeds that would have been received upon settlement of the contract if the Term Loan
Facility as incurred and the notes were issued on March 31, 2017. The actual amount that will be settled will be
determined based on the exchange rates in effect at the closing of the Transactions.

(6) The cash purchase price to be paid at closing is subject to certain adjustments set forth in the Purchase
Agreement based on estimated and actual working capital, cash and indebtedness of Diversey at closing. If
necessary, we expect to pay any increases in the equity purchase price with borrowings under the Revolving
Credit Facility, subject to the limitations set forth in note (1) above.

(7) Reflects estimated fees and expenses associated with the Transactions, commitment, placement and other
financing fees, financial advisory costs and other transaction costs and professional fees. We expect any fees
and expenses in excess of this estimate to be paid with borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, subject
to the limitations set forth in note (1) above.

**Acquisition Adjustments**

(c) The Transactions will be accounted for as an acquisition in accordance with FASB Accounting
Standards Codification (ASC) 805. The pro forma adjustments reflect the Transactions under
the acquisition method of accounting as set forth below. In calculating the pro forma
adjustments, the fair value of our identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed have
been recorded on a preliminary basis. We are in the process of evaluating the fair value of
tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Therefore, the purchase price
allocation is subject to adjustment, which could be material.

(1) Represents the purchase price of approximately $3,200 million pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, adjusted
for unfunded pension obligations and other assumed indebtedness expected to be outstanding at closing.

(2) Represents the book value of the net assets acquired, excluding certain assets and liabilities of the Company,
which will remain with Sealed Air at the closing date of the Transactions.

(3) Reflects the preliminary estimate of fair value allocable to inventory. The adjustment represents an increase in
the net book value of the assets of approximately $20.2 million. The adjustment has not been reflected in the
condensed combined statements of operations as it is non-recurring and the related inventory is expected to
be sold within one year after closing.

(4) Reflects the preliminary estimate of fair value allocable to property and equipment and leased systems with
finite lives. The adjustment represents an increase in the net book value of property and equipment of
approximately $67.2 million and an increase in the net book value of leased systems of approximately
$90.9 million for a combined adjustment of $158.1 million, with estimated weighted-average remaining useful
lives of 6.3 years.

(5) The following table is a summary of the pre-acquisition balance and the estimated fair value adjustment to other
intangible assets based upon a preliminary analysis by a third party appraisal firm. We believe that certain of

(6) Reflects the net adjustment to deferred taxes as a result of (i) the increase to the book value of inventory,
property and equipment and intangible assets to reflect their acquisition-date fair values in jurisdictions with
stock acquisitions at a weighted average statutory tax rate of 34.0%, and (ii) the elimination of historical
deferred taxes that existed in jurisdictions with asset acquisitions, for which the existing book to tax basis
differences will be eliminated upon acquisition. The adjustment also reflects a reclassification of historical
deferred tax assets to reflect a net deferred tax liability position on a pro forma basis, as a result of the
incremental deferred tax liabilities recorded in those jurisdictions.

(7) Represents the estimated amount that may be received in connection with the future settlement of certain
uncertain tax positions that have been indemnified as part of the Transactions. The estimated receivable
approximates the value of the related liability at March 31, 2017 and is recorded as an adjustment to other
non-current assets in the pro forma condensed combined balance sheet.

(8) Represents the preliminary excess of purchase price over the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities
assumed as a result of the Transactions. The goodwill will not be deductible for income tax purposes, except
for certain immaterial foreign jurisdictions where we may be purchasing assets or structuring the acquisition as
an asset purchase.

(d) The pro forma adjustment to total equity represents the elimination of historical net parent
equity, and adjustments for certain expenses related to the Transactions that are not reflected
in the pro forma condensed combined statements of income.

(f) Reflects estimated deferred financing costs related to the notes offered hereby and the Senior
Secured Credit Facilities that will be entered into in connection with the Transactions. Costs
include placement fees for the notes, Revolving Credit Facility fees and financial advisory,
accounting and other professional fees. The deferred financing costs associated with the notes
and the Term Loan Facility are presented net of debt and the deferred financing costs
associated with the Revolving Credit Facility is presented in other non-current assets.

(g) Reflects the Equity Contribution funded from Holdings in the amount of approximately
$814.7 million.

into the Term Loan Facility and the issuance of the notes offered hereby, calculated using an
exchange rate of e1.00=$1.0674 as of March 31, 2017, net of an estimated tax liability of
$10.7 million, and (ii) a loan commitment fee of $7.4 million related to the bridge financing to
be funded in the event the notes offered hereby are not issued at closing, net of estimated tax
deduction of approximately $1.9 million. Assuming the notes were issued at closing, the
bridge financing would expire undrawn and the commitment fee associated with the bridge
facility would be immediately expensed concurrent with the closing of the Transactions. The
tax effects were calculated using the statutory tax rate for the respective jurisdiction.

**NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS**

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations include the
unaudited pro forma adjustments described below for each respective period presented.

(a) The pro forma adjustments set forth above adjust our historical financial statements to reflect
the terms of the Purchase Agreement under which Sealed Air will retain certain assets and
liabilities of the Company. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of
operations have been prepared assuming that all of the asset transfers contemplated by the
Purchase Agreement were completed as of March 31, 2017. In certain foreign jurisdictions,
Sealed Air may not be able to finalize certain asset transfers prior to the actual closing date of
the principal components of the Acquisition. In that event, we have agreed with Sealed Air to
cooperate to satisfy such requirements as promptly as practicable following the closing date
and Sealed Air has agreed that it will continue to operate our businesses in the ordinary
course for our benefit. In addition, until such asset transfers are completed, Sealed Air has
agreed to pay to Holdings an amount equal to the after tax net income (as defined in the
Purchase Agreement), and we have agreed to pay Sealed Air an amount equal to the after tax
net loss (as defined in the Purchase Agreement), in each case, generated by Diversey in any
applicable jurisdiction for which transfer was delayed. If any asset transfer does not occur
within eighteen months following the closing date of the Acquisition, Sealed Air will pay us the
applicable portion of the purchase price of Diversey for the applicable jurisdiction, which will
be calculated in accordance with the terms of the Purchase Agreement, and all obligations
with respect to such jurisdictions will terminate.

**Acquisition Adjustments**

(b) Represents the following adjustments to depreciation and amortization expense. Depreciation
expense for finite-lived property and equipment that are considered manufacturing assets or
non-manufacturing assets will be recorded within cost of sales or selling, general and
administrative expenses, respectively. Amortization expense for finite lived intangible assets is
recorded in amortization expense of intangible assets acquired on the statement of operations.

of intangible assets.

systems. Based on a preliminary valuation of the fair value of property and equipment and leased systems, the
book value increased by approximately $158.1 million, to be expensed over a weighted average period of
6.3 years.

with the Term Loan Facility and the notes offered hereby, including the commitment fee for the unused portion
of the Revolving Credit Facility and the amortization of deferred financing costs associated with the Term Loan
Facility and the notes offered hereby. The interest expense included in the unaudited pro forma condensed
combined financial information reflects a weighted-average interest rate of 4.4%. Actual interest rates may vary
from those depicted in the pro forma amounts and a 0.125% variance in the weighted-average interest rate
would result in a $2.9 million change in income before income taxes. The pro forma adjustments to interest
expense do not reflect the write-off of commitment fees related to e545.0 million in bridge financing to be
funded in the event the notes offered hereby are not issued at closing. Assuming the notes were issued at
closing, the bridge financing would expire undrawn and the commitment fee associated with the bridge facility
would be immediately expensed concurrent with the closing of the Transactions.

(f) To reflect the tax effect of the pro forma adjustments, using a combined federal and state
statutory tax rate of approximately 30%.

**Items Not Included in Pro Forma Condensed Combined Statements of Operations**

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations do not include any
cost savings or restructuring actions which may be achievable in connection with the Transactions,
or the impact of any non-recurring activity, including one-time transaction-related or bridge
commitment fees or certain one-time compensation arrangements that may be payable in
connection with the Transactions, including costs related to the Transactions that were or will be
paid subsequent to March 31, 2017.

In addition, the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations do not
reflect any costs associated with transition services agreements that will be entered into in
connection with the Transactions. These items may have an impact on the statement of operations,
but as they are currently being negotiated such amounts are not currently factually supportable for
purposes of the pro forma condensed combined statements of operations.

In connection with the issuance of the Term Loan Facility, we plan to enter into a net
investment hedge, for the $900.0 million of debt that will be denominated in U.S. dollars, outside
the functional currency of the Issuer. Accordingly, unrealized gains and losses from fluctuations in
the U.S. dollars to euro exchange rates will be recorded in other comprehensive income. To the
extent that the net investment is not effective, gains and losses will be recorded in the statement of
operations. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations assume the
net investment hedge is effective for all periods presented and therefore does not include any
currency gains or losses related to the Term Loan Facility.

result, certain non-cash items allocated from Sealed Air, including stock-based compensation expense and hedging
(gains) losses, were not reflected in our calculation of our historical cash flow from operating activities. Such non-cash
items were reflected within our historical cash flow from financing activities.

_the historical financial information included in this offering circular may not reflect what our results of_
_operations, financial position and cash flows would have been had we operated as a separate,_
_stand-alone company for the periods presented. See ‘‘Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined_

**Overview**

We are a leading global provider of high-performance cleaning, sanitation and hygiene
products for the food safety and service, food and beverage plant operations, healthcare, floor care,
housekeeping and room care, laundry and hand care markets. In addition, we offer a wide range of
value-added services, including food safety and application training and consulting, as well as
auditing of hygiene and water management. We serve institutional and industrial end-users such as
food service providers, lodging establishments, food and beverage processing plants, building
service contractors, building managers and property owners, retail outlets, schools and healthcare
facilities globally. We trace our history back to 1886 and since then have predominantly operated
within larger, diversified, product-driven manufacturing companies including Molson, Unilever, SCJ
and most recently, Sealed Air. Although our cleaning products represent only a small portion of our
customers’ total cleaning costs, they are typically viewed as being non-discretionary given they can
have a meaningful impact on the efficacy of cleaning solutions and operational costs.

Our fully integrated suite of solutions combine chemicals, dispensing equipment, cleaning
machines, services and digital analysis across two distinct business product categories:
Professional and Food & Beverage. Our Professional product category, which represented
approximately 76% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2016, develops and delivers
integrated solutions comprised of chemicals, floor care machines, cleaning tools and utensils, and
digitally enabled systems for the institutional and janitorial markets. Our Food & Beverage product
category, which represented approximately 24% of net sales for the year ended December 31,

83


-----

2016, develops and delivers solutions integrating chemicals, design engineering, cleaning protocols
and equipment, remote data monitoring and predictive analytics for food and beverage
manufacturers.

We are headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina, operate 16 chemical facilities on a global
basis and two equipment plants, and have a global customer facing team of approximately 6,000
employees including sales, marketing and technical service representatives along with
approximately 500 customer service representatives. For the LTM Period, on a pro forma basis after
giving effect to the Transactions, we generated $2,565.0 million in net sales and $387.1 million in
Further Adjusted EBITDA.

**Factors Affecting Our Operating Results**

Our operating results have been, and will likely continue to be, affected by numerous factors,
including the increasing worldwide demand for our products and services, increasing regulatory
compliance costs, macroeconomic and political conditions, introduction of new and upgraded
products, recent acquisitions, foreign currency exchange rates and the effects of the Transactions.
Each of these factors is briefly discussed below.

**_Increasing Demand for Our Products and Services_**

Governmental regulations for food safety and disease control and consumer focus on hygiene
and cleanliness have both increased significantly across the world in recent years. Climate change,
water scarcity and environmental concerns have combined to create further demand for products,
services and solutions designed to minimize waste and support broader sustainability. In addition,
many of our customers require tailored cleaning solutions that can assist in reducing labor, energy,
water use and the costs related to cleaning, sanitation and hygiene activities. We help our
customers realize efficiencies throughout the operation of their facilities by developing customized
solutions. We believe that our value-added customer service approach and proven commitment to
providing cost-savings and sustainable solutions position us well to address these and other critical
demand drivers in order to drive revenue growth.

**_Increasing Regulatory Compliance Costs_**

Although our industry has always been highly regulated, our industry is becoming more
regulated with the introduction of, among other things, the Biocidal Product Regulation and the
Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals. Compliance costs
associated with these new regulations have impacted our cost of doing business and we expect
these regulations and other existing and new regulations to continue to affect our cost of doing
business in the future.

**_Macroeconomic and Political Conditions_**

_Uncertain global economic conditions have had and could continue to have an adverse effect on_
_our consolidated financial condition and results of operations._

Uncertain global economic conditions have had and may continue to have an adverse impact
on our business in the form of lower net sales due to weakened demand, unfavorable changes in
product price/mix, or lower profit margins. For example, global economic downturns have adversely
impacted some of our end-users and customers, such as food processors, distributors,
supermarket retailers, hotels, restaurants, retail establishments, business service contractors,
e-commerce fulfillment firms, and other end-users that are particularly sensitive to business and
consumer spending.

84


-----

During economic downturns or recessions, there can be a heightened competition for sales
and increased pressure to reduce selling prices as our customers may reduce their volume of
purchases from us. If we lose significant sales volume or reduce selling prices significantly, then
there could be a negative impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations,
profitability and cash flows.

Also, reduced availability of credit may adversely affect the ability of some of our customers
and suppliers to obtain funds for operations and capital expenditures. This could negatively impact
our ability to obtain necessary supplies as well as our sales of materials and equipment to affected
customers. This also could result in reduced or delayed collections of outstanding accounts
receivable.

_Political and economic instability and risk of government actions affecting our business and our_
_customers or suppliers may adversely affect our business, results of operations and cash flows._

We are exposed to risks inherent in doing business in each of the countries or regions in
which we or our customers or suppliers operate, including: civil unrest, acts of terrorism, sabotage,
epidemics, force majeure, war or other armed conflict and related government actions, including
sanctions or embargoes, the deprivation of contract rights, the inability to obtain or retain licenses
required by us to operate our plants or import or export our goods or raw materials, the
expropriation or nationalization of our assets, and restrictions on travel, payments or the movement
of funds. In particular, if additional restrictions on trade with Russia were adopted by the European
Union or the U.S. and were applicable to our products, we could lose sales and experience lower
growth rates in the future.

_In the event we are unable to replace the products and related revenues associated with our brand_
_licensing agreement with SCJ, which expired this year, our business and results of operations could_
_be adversely affected._

We reached a mutual agreement to end our existing business relating to our distribution of
SCJ-branded products under the brand licensing agreement with SCJ, which accounted for
approximately 3.8% of our net sales in 2016. The brand licensing agreement with SCJ expired in
May 2017 (with the exception of Australia, New Zealand, Argentina, Chile, Czech Republic and
Poland, where the brand licensing agreement expired on January 1, 2017). Although we are actively
engaged in efforts to replace these SCJ-branded products and the related revenues by, among
other things, developing new partnerships, expanding existing supplier relationships and growing
our brand into new channels, it is uncertain when and if we will be able to fully replace these
SCJ-branded products and/or the related revenues. In the event we are unable to do so, our results
of operations could be negatively impacted.

**_Introduction of New and Upgraded Products_**

An important element of our business strategy is to continue to focus on introducing upgraded
products with new innovative, value-added features and functionalities that replace an existing
product and other new products that we do not currently offer. To date, we have been successful in
increasing our sales by introducing upgraded products with such new features and functionalities,
which in many cases accelerates and drives replacement demand from our existing customers and
provides us with supplementary sales opportunities.

**_Recent Acquisitions_**

_Acquisition of Intellibot Robotics, LLC_

During the first quarter of 2015, we acquired the business of Intellibot Robotics LLC
(‘‘Intellibot’’), a U.S.-based privately owned company that has pioneered the development of robotic
commercial floor cleaning machines. The combination of Diversey’s industry expertise and global
reach and Intellibot’s artificial intelligence technology will help accelerate the development of the
robotic floor cleaning machines market — ultimately driving efficiencies and business value for the
hygiene industry. The fair value of consideration transferred was $17.9 million, which included cash
paid of $8.5 million and $9.4 million related to the fair value of contingent consideration. We
recorded fair value of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed on the acquisition date, which
included $11.0 million of intangible assets. Goodwill of $6.6 million was recorded and 100% will be
deductible for tax purposes. For more information see our combined financial statements and the
related notes thereto included elsewhere in this offering circular.

_Acquisition of Dry Lube Ltd._

During the fourth quarter of 2015, we acquired Dry Lube Ltd. as part of Diversey Europe and
Dry Lube Inc. as part of Diversey North America. As of December 31, 2016, the total purchase price
was $7.8 million of which $6.7 million was allocated to goodwill.

_Acquisition of Tampereen Teollisuuss¨ahk¨o Oy_

During the third quarter of 2016, we acquired Tampereen Teollsuuss¨ahk¨o Oy as pmi of
Diversey Europe. The fair value of the consideration transferred was $8.3 million which included
$2.3 million related to the fair value of contingent consideration. The purchase price allocation had
not been completed as of March 31, 2017, as such, $8.5 million of the purchase price has been
preliminarily allocated to goodwill.

_Acquisition of UVC disinfection portfolio of Daylight Medical_

On April 1, 2017, we acquired the UVC disinfection portfolio of Daylight Medical, a
manufacturer of innovative medical devices. The preliminary fair value of the consideration
transferred was approximately $28.7 million, which included $3.5 million of cash paid at closing as
well as a preliminary fair value for liability-classified contingent consideration. The assets and
liabilities acquired as part of the acquisition will be classified as held for sale on our condensed
consolidated balance sheet in future periods.

**_Foreign Currency Exchange Rates_**

We have significant international operations with approximately 80% of our net sales for the
year ended December 31, 2016 being generated from sales to global customers located outside of
the U.S. The percentage of our sales to international customers has generally increased in recent
periods as we continue to penetrate new markets and geographies and diversify our current
revenue base.

We present our combined financial statements in U.S. dollars. As a result, we must translate
the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of all of our operations into U.S. dollars at applicable
exchange rates. Consequently, increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar may affect the
value of these items with respect to our non-U.S. dollar businesses in our combined financial
statements, even if their value has not changed in their local currency. For example, a stronger U.S.
dollar will reduce the relative value of reported results of non-U.S. dollar operations, and,
conversely, a weaker U.S. dollar will increase the relative value of the non-U.S. dollar operations.

86


-----

These translations could significantly affect the comparability of our results between financial
periods and/or result in significant changes to the carrying value of our assets, liabilities and
stockholders’ equity.

In addition, we generate a significant portion of our sales in currencies other than the U.S.
dollar, primarily the euro, the Canadian dollar and the British pound, but incur substantially all of
our expenses in U.S. dollars. As a result, our results of operations are impacted by currency
exchange rate fluctuations because we are generally unable to match revenues received in foreign
currencies with expenses incurred in the same currency. For example, where we have significantly
more sales than expenses incurred in a foreign currency, our profit from operations in that location
would be adversely affected in the event that the U.S. dollar appreciates against that foreign
currency. From time to time, as and when we determine it is appropriate and advisable to do so,
we will seek to mitigate the effect of exchange rate fluctuations through the use of derivative
financial instruments.

**Effects of the Transactions**

**_Purchase Agreement_**

On March 25, 2017, the Issuer, a newly-formed holding company owned by affiliates of Bain
Capital, entered into the Purchase Agreement with respect to the purchase of Diversey from Sealed
Air for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $3,200.0 million, excluding fees and expenses
and subject to a customary working capital adjustment and certain other adjustments.

We will enter into the Transition Services Agreement pursuant to which Sealed Air will provide
us with various transition services, including finance, accounting, human resources, customer
service, information technology, quality control services and, for our operations outside the U.S.,
warehousing, logistics and access to sales offices for our sales personnel. We generally expect to
use these services for approximately three to twelve months following the consummation of the
Transactions, depending on the type of service and the location at which they are provided.

For additional information regarding the Purchase Agreement, the Transition Services
Agreement and the other agreements to be entered into in connection with the Transactions and
governing our relationship with Sealed Air going forward, see ‘‘Certain Relationships and Related
Party Transactions’’.

**_Estimated Cost Savings_**

We believe the operation of our business as a stand-alone company will provide us the
opportunity to realize significant cost savings across multiple areas. Primarily, we expect to
maximize the benefits of scale through consolidated purchasing. These cost savings initiatives can
be grouped into four major categories: (1) reducing back-office costs, (2) improving our
procurement strategy, (3) enhancing the efficiency of our manufacturing and supply chain networks
and (4) continuing our focus on improving commercial excellence and sales force productivity. We
have identified approximately $55.0 million of selling, general and administrative and procurement
cost savings that we believe can be realized by the end of 2018 following the consummation of the
Acquisition. Additionally, we expect to incur approximately $35.0 million of related one-time costs
over the next 12 to 18 months in order to achieve these savings. Over the longer term, we expect
that there will be additional opportunities to achieve further cost savings through these initiatives as
well as by optimizing our manufacturing and supply chain networks and focusing on productivity
and commercial excellence.

The following table sets forth the estimated cost savings that we believe could have been
realized during the LTM Period assuming the Transactions were completed as of the beginning of

87


-----

such period. These adjustments are reflected in our presentation of Further Adjusted EBITDA for the
LTM Period. See ‘‘Summary—Summary Unaudited Historical and Pro Forma Financial Data’’.
Amounts shown have not been adjusted to reflect any of the one-time expenses that we expect to
incur in connection with achieving such cost savings. These cost savings are based on estimates
and assumptions made by us that are inherently uncertain, and are subject to significant business,
economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, all of which are difficult to predict and
many of which are beyond our control. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Acquisition—We
may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of the Transactions, and the Transactions may
adversely affect our business’’. The following calculations should not be viewed as indicative of
future results:

**_Effects on Our Financial Statements_**

**_Purchase Accounting._** Our financial statements in the future will vary in important respects
from the historical combined financial statements contained in this offering circular. The acquisition
of our company will be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. As a result, the
purchase price for our company of approximately $2,964.7 million will be allocated to the tangible
and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values as of
the date of the Acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over these allocations will be assigned
to goodwill, which is not amortized for accounting purposes but is subject to testing for impairment
at least annually. The allocation of the purchase price of the assets acquired in the Acquisition will
result in a significant increase in amortization and depreciation expense relating to our acquired
intangible assets and manufacturing assets, because we will record the fair value of the acquired
intangible assets and adjust the book value of the acquired manufacturing assets to fair value. We
will depreciate the manufacturing assets and amortize the intangible assets over their estimated
useful lives. We will also adjust the value of the inventory to its respective fair value, which will lower
our gross margin in the period subsequent to the closing of the Transactions. See ‘‘Unaudited Pro
Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information’’.

**_Increased Leverage._** As of March 31, 2017, after giving pro forma effect to the Transactions,
we would have had approximately $2,357.0 million of outstanding indebtedness represented by
Term Loan Facility and the notes offered hereby, with $250.0 million of additional borrowing
capacity available under the Revolving Credit Facility. For the LTM Period, after giving pro forma
effect to the Transactions, our interest expense would have been $120.6 million. As a result of the
Transactions, we will be a highly leveraged company and our interest expense will be significant in
the periods following the consummation of the Transactions. Our large amount of indebtedness
may limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and future business
opportunities since a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations will be dedicated to

88


-----

servicing our indebtedness, and this may place us at a competitive disadvantage as some of our
competitors are less leveraged. Our leverage may make us more vulnerable to a downturn in our
business, industry or the economy in general. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes and
Our Indebtedness—Our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and
prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under the notes’’.

**_Stand-Alone Company._** We have historically operated as a business unit/division of Sealed
Air and not as a stand-alone company. The historical carve-out financial statements included in this
offering circular have been derived from the historical consolidated financial statements of Sealed
Air using our historical results of operations and the historical basis of our assets and liabilities. The
historical financial information included in this offering circular may not reflect what our results of
operations, financial position and cash flows would have been had we operated as a separate,
stand-alone company without the shared resources of Sealed Air for the periods presented, and
may not be indicative of our future results of operations, financial position and cash flows. See our
combined financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this offering circular.

Sealed Air has historically provided various services to us, including finance, accounting,
human resources, customer service, information technology and quality control services, as well as
warehousing, logistics and access to sales offices for our sales personnel. The costs of these
services have been allocated or directly charged to us as shown in our historical financial
statements included elsewhere in this offering circular, and amounted to $110.0 million and
$118.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. These expenses and all other
centralized operating costs were allocated first on the basis of direct usage when identifiable, with
the remainder being allocated among Sealed Air’s business units on the basis of their respective
revenue, headcount or other appropriate measure. We believe these allocations are a reasonable
reflection of the use of these services from Sealed Air. The allocated costs included in our historical
financial statements could differ from amounts that would have been incurred by us if we operated
on a stand-alone basis and are not necessarily indicative of costs to be incurred in the future.
During the period that Sealed Air will provide services for us pursuant to the Transition Services
Agreement, we expect to incur higher costs than the allocated costs included in our historical
financial statements because we will incur additional expenses to build up our organization to
perform such functions internally in addition to the amounts we will pay Sealed Air for such
services. After the termination of the Transition Services Agreement, we expect to incur lower costs
than the allocated costs included in our historical financial statements because we believe we will
able to perform such functions at a lower cost than the allocated amounts.

During the periods presented, most of our employees were eligible to participate in various
Sealed Air employee benefit retirement plans, including defined benefit, defined contribution and
retiree healthcare benefit plans. Sealed Air has managed its employee benefit retirement plans on a
consolidated basis and separate information for us with respect to these periods is not readily
available. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, Sealed Air will retain substantially all the obligations
to our employees under its post-retirement benefit plans. Our combined statements of income
include an allocation of the costs of the employee benefit plans. These costs were allocated based
on our employee population for each of the periods presented. In conjunction with purchase
accounting for the Transactions, we will reflect the projected benefit obligations and value of the
transferred assets for our post-retirement benefit plans on our opening balance sheet. In addition,
our employees were eligible to participate in various Sealed Air employee benefit programs,
including health and dental plans, 401k plans, equity awards plans and deferred compensation
arrangements for qualifying employees. Our combined statements of income include the costs of
these benefit plans for our employees based on our employee population for each of the periods
presented. The allocated costs included in our historical financial statements could differ from

89


-----

amounts that would have been incurred by us if we operated on a stand-alone basis and are not
necessarily indicative of costs to be incurred in the future.

During each of the periods presented, we participated in Sealed Air’s centralized cash
management system. Cash receipts attributable to our operations were collected by Sealed Air and
cash disbursements were funded by Sealed Air. Cash advances necessary to fund our major
improvements to and replacements of property, and acquisitions and expansion, to the extent not
provided through internally generated funds, were provided by Sealed Air’s cash or funded with a
capital lease. As a result, none of Sealed Air’s cash, cash equivalents or debt has been allocated to
our historical combined balance sheets.

For all periods presented, we were included in the consolidated income tax returns of Sealed
Air. However, in our historical combined financial statements included in this offering circular,
income taxes have been presented based on a calculation of the income tax expense that would
have been incurred if we had operated as a separate taxpayer. Income taxes have been estimated
for all items included in the statements of income included herein, regardless of whether such items
were reported for tax purposes or when the taxes were actually paid or refunded.

**Components of Our Sales and Expenses**

**_Net Sales_**

We sell our products primarily through a direct sales force in the U.S. and a combination of
direct sales representatives and independent distributors in international markets. We recognize
revenue when title to the goods and risk of loss transfers to customers, provided there are no
material remaining performance obligations required of us or any matters requiring customer
acceptance. In cases where we utilize distributors or ship product directly to the end-user, we
recognize revenue upon shipment provided all revenue recognition criteria have been met. For
multiple-element arrangements, we specifically identify revenue from the arrangement for each
element based on the relative fair value of each element, which is based on reliable and objective
evidence. The fair value is generally based on the relative sales price of each element when sold
separately. Revenue related to service contracts is recognized ratably over the contract period and
any unrecognized amounts are included as deferred revenue in the combined balance sheets. We
record estimated sales returns, discounts, and rebates as a reduction of net sales in the same
period revenue is recognized.

**_Cost of Sales_**

Cost of sales is primarily comprised of direct materials and supplies consumed in the
production of product, as well as labor and direct overhead expense necessary to acquire and
convert the purchased materials and supplies into finished products. Also included are expenses
associated with service organization, quality oversight and warranty costs. A portion of the
employee benefit cost and corporate overhead allocated to us by Sealed Air has been recorded as
cost of products sold based on various allocation methodologies.

**_Operating Expenses_**

_Selling, General and Administrative Expense_

Selling, general and administrative expense includes employee compensation, clinical trial
expenses, professional services, customer promotions and events, employee travel, shipping, rent
and utilities, stock-based employee compensation expense, depreciation expense, maintenance and
security, and other miscellaneous expenses. A portion of the employee benefit cost and corporate

90


-----

overhead allocated to us by Sealed Air has been recorded as selling, general and administrative
expense based on various allocation methodologies.

_Amortization Expense of Intangible Assets Acquired_

Amortization expense of intangible assets acquired includes amortization expense for
intangible assets and other intellectual property that has been acquired through various acquisitions
of businesses by us.

_Restructuring and Other Charges_

Restructuring and other charges include expenses related to our participation in Sealed Air’s
combined restructuring program. These expenses relate to reduction in headcount, relocation of
certain facilities and people to other offices and other expenses, as well as labor and direct
overhead expense necessary to acquire and convert the purchased materials and supplies into
finished products. Also included are expenses associated with service organization, quality
oversight and warranty costs. A portion of the employee benefit cost and corporate overhead
allocated to us by Sealed Air has been recorded as cost of products sold based on various
allocation methodologies.

**_Non-Operating Expense, net_**

Non-operating expense, net includes interest expense, interest income, foreign currency
exchange gains and losses related to our Venezuelan subsidiaries and other income (expense), net.
Our interest expense relates to our outstanding debt, including our short-term borrowings, the
delayed draw Term Loan A tranche of Sealed Air’s senior secured credit facilities, our lines of credit
and other debt. The foreign currency exchange loss related to our Venezuelan subsidiaries relates
to the required re-measurement of all bolivar-denominated monetary assets and liabilities into U.S.
dollars using the current exchange rate available to us, as Venezuela has been designated as a
highly inflationary economy under GAAP. Other income (expense), net relates to our interest and
dividend income, our net foreign exchange transaction gains (losses), parent intercompany expense
primarily consisting of royalty expenses, net, income from our equity method investment, net gain
(loss) on disposals of property and equipment and other, bank fee expenses and other items, net.

**_Income Taxes_**

The provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach. Tax laws
require items to be included in tax filings at different times than the items are reflected in the
financial statements. The income tax provisions have been prepared on a separate return basis as if
we were a stand-alone entity. Historically, we were included in tax filings with other Sealed Air
entities. The results from being included in the combined tax returns are included in net parent
investment. Sealed Air’s global tax structure and model has been developed based on its entire
portfolio of businesses. Accordingly, our tax results as presented are not reflective of the tax results
that we will generate in the future or would have generated on a stand-alone basis.

Deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid. Deferred taxes are adjusted for enacted
changes in tax rates and tax laws. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets
when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized.

We do not maintain taxes payable to/from Sealed Air, and we are deemed to settle the annual
current tax balances immediately with the legal taxpaying entities in the respective jurisdictions.
These settlements are reflected as changes in net parent investment.

91


-----

We record tax benefits for uncertain tax positions based upon management’s evaluation of the
information available at the reporting date. To be recognized in the financial statements, a tax
benefit must be at least more likely than not of being sustained based on technical merits. The
benefit for positions meeting the recognition threshold is measured as the largest benefit more
likely than not of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of
all relevant information.

Total net sales decreased $2.9 million, or 0.5% for the three months ended March 31, 2017
compared to the three months ended March 31, 2016.

_Professional_

Net sales from our Professional product category decreased by $6.9 million, or 1.6%, for the
three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2016. On a
constant currency basis, net sales from our Professional product category increased $3.3 million, or
0.8%, for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the three months ended March 31,

92


-----

2016. This 0.8% growth was primarily driven by increased volume in APAC, particularly in our China
dishwasher rentals, budget hotels and our food service platforms, India, and MEA, particularly
Turkey and Egypt. In addition, price increases as a result of various pricing actions taken in Turkey,
Egypt and LATAM also contributed to this increase. This increase has been partially offset by
destocking initiatives by distributors as part of their inventory optimization strategy.

_Food & Beverage_

Net sales from our Food & Beverage product category increased by $4.0 million, or 2.8%, for
the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2016. On
a constant currency basis, net sales from our Food & Beverage product category increased
$7.1 million, or 4.9%, for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the three months
ended March 31, 2016, primarily driven by increases in volume as a result of customer wins in
LATAM, South Africa and North America and increases in prices from pricing actions taken in
LATAM and Nigeria. This increase was partially offset by decreases due to customer losses in
China.

Professional product category decreased by $2.6 million for the three months ended March 31,
2017 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2016. This decrease on a constant currency
basis was primarily due to the impact of Brexit in the UK and increased spending for additional
dosing and dispensing equipment to meet the needs for our new customer wins in North America
and Europe. Gross profit from our Food & Beverage product category increased by $2.8 million, or
4.9%, for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the three months ended March 31,
2016. On a constant currency basis, gross profit from our Food & Beverage product category
increased by $3.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the three
months ended March 31, 2016. This increase on a constant currency basis was primarily driven by
volume growth in LATAM, MEA and North America as well as increased prices in LATAM resulting
from pricing actions taken in LATAM.

**_Operating Expenses_**

Our operating expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and March 31, 2016 were
as follows:

Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $10.6 million, or 4.4%, for the three
months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2016. On a
constant currency basis, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $6.8 million for
the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2016,
which reflected a $4.7 million refund of excess wage taxes previously paid on stock appreciation
rights in 2017. The remaining decrease was primarily attributable to a reduction in expenses
allocated from Sealed Air, driven by the timing of those allocations and not expected to repeat,
partially offset by an increase in expenses incurred in 2017 related to our separation from Sealed
Air.

Adjustments to restructuring related liabilities resulted in a gain of $2.1 million for the three
months ended March 31, 2017 which compares to expense of $0.5 million for the three months
ended March 31, 2016.

**_Non-Operating Results_**

As reported, non-operating expenses decreased by $2.6 million, or 45.6%, in the three months
ended March 31, 2017 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2016, primarily due to a
decrease in foreign currency transaction losses, which are included in other (income) expense, net.

March 31, 2017 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2016. The increase in net income
is all driven by the savings in selling, general and administrative expenses.

2.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015.

97


-----

This 2.1% growth was primarily driven by increased growth in APAC, particularly in China, India,
and Southeast Asia as a result of new customer wins and price increases, growth in LATAM as a
result of increased prices, growth in Europe as a result of pricing increases and increased volume
from our distributors particularly in the Netherlands and Germany and growth in North America due
to increases in volume. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in MEA driven by turbulent
market conditions in Turkey and Egypt, which experienced a decline in tourism impacting our
customers in the hospitality and restaurant end-markets.

**_Food & Beverage_**

Net sales from our Food & Beverage product category decreased by $18.0 million, or 2.9%,
for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. On a
constant currency basis, net sales from our Food & Beverage product category increased
$23.1 million, or 3.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended
December 31, 2015. This 3.7% growth was primarily driven by increased pricing resulting from
pricing actions taken in LATAM, APAC, Europe, and the MEA. This increase was also due to
increased volumes in North America, Europe, MEA and LATAM.

the year ended December 31, 2015. This increase on a constant currency basis was primarily due

supply chain. Gross profit from our Food & Beverage product category decreased by $6.9 million
for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. On a
constant currency basis, gross profit from our Food & Beverage product category increased by
$7.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31,

spread as price increases outpaced increases in raw materials and freight expenses.

Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $28.5 million, or 2.9%, for the year
ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. On a constant
currency basis, selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $6.0 million for the year
ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily driven by
salary and wage inflation and targeted investments in sales and marketing as well as an increase in
corporate allocations from Sealed Air, primarily related to the timing of those allocations. These
were partially offset by savings resulting from restructuring programs.

Amortization expenses of intangible assets acquired increased $2.7 million, or 4.9%, for the
year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to
the accelerated amortization of intangible assets related to ceasing operations in Venezuela.

Restructuring and other charges for the year ended December 31, 2016 decreased by
$18.5 million, or 63.1%, reflecting increased spend in 2015 related to the closure and consolidation
of certain facilities, and the relocation of Sealed Air’s corporate headquarters to Charlotte, North
Carolina.

-----

As reported, non-operating (income) expenses decreased by $12.1 million, or 50.4%, in the
year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to
a decrease in foreign currency transaction losses included within other income (expense), net, a
decrease in foreign currency remeasurement losses related to our Venezuelan subsidiaries and due
to the strengthening in the U.S. dollar against the Brazilian Real which reduced our interest expense
on our Real denominated debt.

For the year ended December 31, 2016, the tax benefit differs from that calculated based on
statutory rates primarily due to a reduction in tax reserves on uncertain tax positions, primarily
related to the expiration of the statute of limitations.

The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2015 differs from the statutory
rate primarily due to a reduction in tax reserves on uncertain tax positions, primarily related to the
expiration of the statute of limitations.

**_Net Income (Loss)_**

For the year ended December 31, 2016, net income was $108.2 million, an increase of
$23.0 million or 27.0%, from $85.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was
primarily due to a decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses as discussed above.

historical overhead expenses allocated by Sealed Air to Diversey which were identified by management through its
analysis of Diversey’s personnel and functional areas as the expenses that would not have been incurred by Diversey
had it been operated as a stand-alone entity. The Diversey business has historically been operated by Sealed Air on a
substantially stand-alone basis.

**Liquidity and Capital Resources**

**_Historical_**

Our principal sources of cash have historically been from operating activities and our principal
uses of cash have historically been capital expenditures and the financing of working capital. Our
principal source of liquidity in excess of cash from operating activities has historically been
advances from Sealed Air.

**_Cash Flows_**

During each of the three months ended March 31, 2017, the three months ended March 31,
2016, the year ended December 31, 2016 and the year ended December 31, 2015, we participated
in Sealed Air’s centralized cash management system. As a result, none of Sealed Air’s cash or cash
equivalents has been allocated to our historical combined financial statements.

Below are our primary sources and uses of cash and capital expenditures for the three
months ended March 31, 2017, the three months ended March 31, 2016, the year ended
December 31, 2016 and the year ended December 31, 2015:

**_Operating Activities._** Net cash used for operations was $93.9 million and $8.6 million for the
three months ended March 31, 2017 and the three months ended March 31, 2016, respectively. Key
elements of net cash used for operating activities during the three months ended March 31, 2017
were primarily driven by a net loss of $2.9 million, adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash
provided by operating activities of $26.0 million, primarily driven by depreciation and amortization,
and a decrease in net operating assets and liabilities of $117.0 million primarily related to
decreases in other assets and liabilities and inventories, partially offset by an increase in trade
receivables, net, and accounts payable.

Key elements of net cash used for operating activities during the three months ended
March 31, 2016 were primarily driven by a net loss of $12.6 million, adjustments to reconcile net
income to net cash provided by operating activities of $28.0 million, primarily driven by depreciation
and amortization, and a decrease in net operating assets and liabilities of $24.0 million primarily
related to decreases in other assets and liabilities and inventories, partially offset by an increase in
accounts payable.

We generated cash flow from operations of $174.2 million and $51.1 million in the year ended
December 31, 2016 and the year ended December 31, 2015, respectively. Key elements of net cash
provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2016 were primarily driven by
net income of $108.2 million, adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by
operating activities of $103.7 million, primarily driven by depreciation and amortization, and a
decrease in net operating assets and liabilities of $37.7 million primarily related to decreases in our
other assets and liabilities and trade receivables, net, partially offset by an increase in accounts
payable. The decreases in our other assets and liabilities and trade receivables and increase in
accounts payable were due to timing.

Key elements of net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended
December 31, 2015 were primarily driven by net income of $85.2 million, adjustments to reconcile
net income to net cash provided by operating activities of $97.1 million, primarily driven by
depreciation and amortization, and a decrease in net operating assets and liabilities of
$131.2 million primarily related to decreases in our other assets and liabilities, partially offset by an
increase in accounts payable. The decrease in our other assets and liabilities and increase in
accounts payable were due to timing.

**_Investing Activities._** Net cash used in investing activities was $2.2 million and $7.4 million in
the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Net cash used in investing
activities for the three months ended March 31, 2017 consisted of $3.4 million of capital
expenditures partially offset by $1.2 million of net cash provided by other investing activities.

103


-----

Net cash used in investing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2016 consisted of
$7.8 million of capital expenditures partially offset by $0.4 million of net cash provided by other
investing activities.

Net cash used in investing activities was $20.4 million and $17.7 million for the year ended
December 31, 2016 and the year ended December 31, 2015, respectively. Net cash used in
investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 consisted of $17.7 million of capital
expenditures, $5.8 million of businesses acquired in purchase transactions, net of cash and cash
equivalents acquired, and $1.4 million of settlement of foreign currency forward contracts. Net cash
provided by investing activities consisted of $4.5 million in proceeds from the sale of property,
plant, equipment and other assets.

Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 consisted of
$37.1 million of capital expenditures and $12.1 million of businesses acquired in purchase
transactions net of cash and cash equivalents acquired. Net cash provided by investing activities
consisted of $31.5 million in proceeds from the sale of property, plant, equipment and other assets.

**_Financing Activities._** Net cash provided by financing activities was $94.1 million for the three
months ended March 31, 2017 and net cash used in financing activities was $2.5 million for the
three months ended March 31, 2016. Net cash used in financing activities represents net transfers
of cash from / (to) Sealed Air under its centralized cash management system.

Net cash provided by financing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2017
consisted of $4.9 million in net proceeds from borrowings and $91.2 million for change in net
parent investment, partially offset by $2.0 million in other financing activities.

Net cash used in financing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2016 consisted
$7.4 million change in net parent investment and $0.1 million in other financing activities, partially
offset by $5.0 million in net proceeds from borrowings.

Net cash used in financing activities was $181.5 million and $12.2 million in the years ended
2016 and fiscal 2015, respectively. Net cash used in financing activities for the year ended
December 31, 2016 consisted of $4.0 million in net payments from borrowings, a $185.6 million
change in Sealed Air’s investment, and was partially offset by a $1.9 million change in cash used
as collateral on borrowing arrangements and $6.2 million in other financing activities.

Net cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 consisted of
$1.5 million in net payments from borrowings, a $3.8 million change in Sealed Air’s investment and
a $6.9 million change in cash used as collateral on borrowing arrangements.

**_Capital Expenditures._** Capital expenditures were $17.7 million in the year ended
December 31, 2016 and $37.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2015. Historic capital
expenditures do not include expenditures on dosing and dispensing equipment. Capital
expenditures on dosing and dispensing equipment in fiscal 2017 are expected to be $45.0 million.

**_Post-Transactions_**

Following the Transactions, our primary sources of liquidity from our business will continue to
be cash flows from operations. We will have additional liquidity under the Revolving Credit Facility.
We expect that our primary liquidity requirements will be for debt service, working capital and
capital expenditures.

After the consummation of the Transactions, we will have a significant amount of
indebtedness. As of March 31, 2017, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions, we
would have had approximately $2,357.0 million of aggregate principal amount of indebtedness
outstanding and an additional $250.0 million of unused commitments available to be borrowed

104


-----

under our Revolving Credit Facility. No letters of credit are expected to be issued and outstanding
under the Revolving Credit Facility as of the date of the consummation of the Transactions, but
letters of credit, if issued, may be drawn after the closing date of the Transactions or, subject to
certain limitations, on such closing date. Our liquidity requirements will be significant, primarily due
to debt service requirements. On a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions, our
interest expense for the LTM Period would have been approximately $120.6 million and our pro
forma cash interest expense would have been approximately $110.8 million for such period. See
‘‘Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information’’.

For a summary of the terms of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, see ‘‘Description of Certain
Other Indebtedness’’. For a summary of the terms of the notes, see ‘‘Description of Notes’’.

Following the completion of the Transactions, we intend to rely primarily upon cash funded
onto our balance sheet as part of the Transactions together with cash generated from operations to
fund our debt service requirements, capital expenditures and working capital and believe that these
amounts will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future. We generally expect
to utilize our borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility in limited circumstances and in
order to take advantage of strategic opportunities or initiatives. Our ability to fund these items and
otherwise to reduce our indebtedness may be affected by general economic, financial, competitive,
legislative and regulatory factors, and the cost of litigation claims, among other things.

We believe that our current financial position and financing plans will provide flexibility in
financing activities and permit us to respond to changing conditions in credit markets. We cannot
make assurances, however, that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or
that future borrowings will be available to us under the Revolving Credit Facility in an amount
sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness, including the notes, or to fund our other liquidity
needs.

**Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments**

The following table reflects our contractual obligations as of March 31, 2017, on a pro forma
basis after giving effect to the Transactions. Some of the figures we include in this table are based
on management’s estimates and assumptions about these obligations, including their duration, the
possibility of renewal, anticipated actions by third parties, and other factors. Because these
estimates and assumptions are necessarily subjective, the obligations we will actually pay in future
periods may vary from those reflected in the table:

(1) These amounts include principal maturities for capital lease obligations.

(2) Certain leases require us to pay real estate taxes, insurance, maintenance, and other operating expenses associated
with the leased premises. These future costs are not included in the table above. The operating leases above reflect

105


-----

Sealed Air’s operating leases outside of the U.S. We expect to enter into replacement operating leases after the
closing date of the Transactions as we continue to build our stand-alone organization outside the U.S.

(3) Other principal contractual obligations include agreements to purchase an estimated amount of goods, including raw
materials, or services, including energy, in the normal course of business. These obligations are enforceable and
legally binding and specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, minimum or
variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the purchase. The amounts included in the table above
represent estimates of the minimum amounts we are obligated to pay, or reasonably likely to pay under these
agreements. We may purchase additional goods or services above the minimum requirements of these obligations
and, as a result use additional cash.

(4) In connection with the Transactions, we expect to enter into the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the notes offered
hereby, which have pro forma balances as of March 31, 2017 related to (i) a new approximately $1,800 million Term
Loan Facility consisting of (A) a $900.0 million U.S. dollar denominated tranche and (B) an e820.0 million
euro-denominated tranche, or approximately $875.3 million using an exchange rate of e1.00=$1.0674 as of March 31,
2017 and (ii) the notes offered hereby in an aggregate principal amount of e545.0 million, or approximately
$581.7 million using an exchange rate of e1.00=$1.0674 as of March 31, 2017. The amounts reflected in the table
above are the expected principal payments to be made under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the notes
offered hereby. Using an exchange rate of $1.1000 (which takes into account that in connection with the Transactions,
we entered into a foreign currency forward contract to fix the amount receivable with respect to (x) the
euro-denominated tranche of the Term Loan Facility and (y) the notes offered hereby, which such forward contract
fixed the euro-to-dollar exchange rate at the rate then in effect at the signing of the Purchase Agreement), the
aggregate principal amount of the euro-denominated tranche of the Term Loan Facility would be $902.0 million and
the aggregate principal amount of the notes offered hereby would be $599.5 million.

(5) At March 31, 2017, we had liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties of $54.1 million,
most of which is included in other liabilities and the remaining balance is included as a reduction to deferred tax
assets on our consolidated balance sheet. At March 31, 2017, we cannot reasonably estimate the future period or
periods of cash settlement of these liabilities. See Note 13, ‘‘Income Taxes’’, of the notes to our combined financial
statements included elsewhere in this offering circular for further discussion. In addition, obligations related to defined
benefit pension plans and other post-employment benefit plans have been excluded from the table above. Due to
factors such as the retirement of employees, it is not reasonably possible to estimate when these obligations will
become due.

**Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements**

We have reviewed our off-balance sheet arrangements and have determined that none of
those arrangements has a material current effect or is reasonably likely to have a material future
effect on our consolidated financial statements, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.

_Guarantees and Indemnification Obligations_

We are a party to many contracts containing guarantees and indemnification obligations.
These contracts primarily consist of:

   - product warranties with respect to certain products sold to customers in the ordinary course
of business. These warranties typically provide that products will conform to specifications.
We generally do not establish a liability for product warranty based on a percentage of sales
or other formula. We accrue a product warrant liability on a transaction-specific basis
depending on the individual facts and circumstances related to each sale. Both the liability
and annual expense related to product warranties are immaterial to our condensed
combined balance sheet or statement of operations; and

   - licenses of intellectual property by us to third parties in which we have agreed to indemnify
the licensee against third party infringement claims.

**Inflation**

We believe inflation has not had a material effect on our financial condition or results of
operations in recent years.

106


-----

**Critical Accounting Policies**

Our discussion and analysis of our combined financial condition and results of operations are
based on our combined financial statements, which are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The
preparation of our financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and
expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.

Our estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are based on all
available evidence, including historical experience and other factors believed to be reasonable
under the circumstances. To derive these estimates and assumptions, management draws from
those available sources that can best contribute to its efforts. These sources include our officers
and other employees, outside consultants and legal counsel, third-party experts and actuaries. In
addition, we use internally generated reports and statistics, such as aging of trade receivables, as
well as outside sources such as government statistics, industry reports and third party research
studies. The results of these estimates and assumptions may form the basis of the carrying value of
assets and liabilities and may not be readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ
from estimates under conditions and circumstances different from those assumed, and any such
differences may be material to our combined financial statements.

We believe the following accounting policies are critical to understanding our combined results
of operations and affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of
our combined financial statements. The critical accounting policies discussed below should be read
together with our significant accounting policies set forth in Note 2, ‘‘Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies and Recently Issued Accounting Standards’’ of the notes to our combined
financial statements included elsewhere in this offering circular.

**_Financial Instruments_**

We may use financial instruments, such as cross-currency swaps, interest rate swaps, caps
and collars, U.S. treasury lock agreements and foreign currency exchange forward contracts and
options relating to our borrowing and trade activities. We may use these financial instruments from
time to time to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange
rates. We do not purchase, hold or sell derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. We
face credit risk if the counterparties to these transactions are unable to perform their obligations.
Our policy is to have counterparties to these contracts that are rated at least BBB� by S&P and
Baa3 by Moody’s.

We report derivative instruments at fair value and establish criteria for designation and
effectiveness of transactions entered into for hedging purposes. Before entering into any derivative
transaction, we identify our specific financial risk, the appropriate hedging instrument to use to
reduce this risk, and the correlation between the financial risk and the hedging instrument. We use
forecasts and historical data as the basis for determining the anticipated values of the transactions
to be hedged. We do not enter into derivative transactions that do not have a high correlation
between the transaction risks and the hedging instruments.

We account for derivative instruments as hedges of the related underlying risks if we
designate these derivative instruments as hedges and the derivative instruments are effective as
hedges of recognized assets or liabilities, forecasted transactions, unrecognized firm commitments
or forecasted intercompany transactions. We record gains and losses on derivatives qualifying as
cash flow hedges in other comprehensive loss, to the extent that hedges are effective and until the
underlying transactions are recognized on the combined statements of operations, at which time we
recognize the gains and losses on the combined statements of operations.

107


-----

Generally, our practice is to terminate derivative transactions if the underlying asset or liability
matures or is old or terminated or if we determine the underlying forecasted transaction is no
longer probable of occurring. Any deferred gains or losses associated with the derivative instrument
are recognized on the combined statements of operations over the period in which the income or
expense on the underlying hedged transaction is recognized. See our combined financial
statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this offering circular for further
details.

**_Fair Value Measurements of Financial Instruments_**

In determining the fair value of financial instruments, we utilize various techniques that
maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to the extent
possible and consider counterparty credit risk in our assessment of fair value. We determine fair
value for our financial instruments based on assumptions that market participants would use in
pricing an asset or liability in the principal or most advantageous market. When considering market
participant assumptions in fair value measurements, the following fair value hierarchy distinguishes
between observable and unobservable inputs, which are categorized in one of the following levels:

   - Level 1 Inputs: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
to the reporting entity at the measurement date.

   - Level 2 Inputs: Other than quoted prices included in Level 1 inputs that are observable for
the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or
liability.

   - Level 3 Inputs: Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability used to measure fair value to
the extent that observable inputs are not available, thereby allowing for situations in which
there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date.

Our fair value measurements in our financial instruments are subjective and involve
uncertainties and matters of significant judgment. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect
our estimates. See Note 11 of our combined financial statements included elsewhere in this offering
circular for further details on our fair value measurements.

**_Share-Based Incentive Compensation_**

We record share-based compensation awards exchanged for employee services at fair value
on the date of grant and record the expense for these awards in cost of sales and in selling,
general and administrative expense, as applicable, on our combined statements of operations over
the requisite employee service period. Share-based incentive compensation expense includes an
estimate for forfeitures and anticipated achievement levels and is generally recognized over the
expected term of the award on a straight-line basis. We accelerate expense using a graded vesting
schedule for employees who meet retirement eligibility requirements prior to the end of the award’s
service period. For performance-based awards, we reassess at each reporting date whether
achievement of the performance condition is probable and accrues compensation expense if and
when the achievement of the performance condition is probable. For market-based awards, the fair
value of the award is determined at the grant date and is recognized at 100% over the performance
period regardless of actual market condition performance.

**_Income Taxes_**

Our taxable income was historically included in the U.S. federal and certain state income tax
returns of Sealed Air. In our combined financial statements included elsewhere in this offering
circular, our provision for income taxes is computed following the separate return method. On a

108


-----

consolidated basis, Sealed Air has significant tax attributes such as foreign tax credit carryovers
and net operating loss carryovers in various jurisdictions and around the world. Because Diversey is
part of the same Sealed Air legal entities that generated many of these tax attributes, Sealed Air has
allocated certain of these attributes to Diversey. We have recorded a tax benefit for these attributes
in a separate return tax provision. These attributes may not be transferred to newly-created legal
entities in an asset sale transaction or other disposition transactions.

Estimates and judgements are required in the calculation of tax liabilities and in the
determination of the recoverability of our deferred tax assets. In assessing the need for a valuation
allowance, we estimate future taxable earnings, with consideration for the feasibility of ongoing
planning strategies and the realizability of tax benefit carry forwards and past operating results, to
determine which deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized in the future. Changes
to tax laws, statutory tax rates and future taxable earnings can have an impact on valuation
allowances related to deferred tax assets. In the event that actual results differ from these estimates
in future periods, we may need to adjust the valuation allowance, which could have a material
impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations.

In calculating our worldwide provision for income taxes, we also evaluate our tax positions for
years where the statutes of limitations have not expired. Based on this review, we may establish
reserves for additional taxes and interest that could be assessed upon examination by relevant tax
authorities. We adjust these reserves to take into account changing facts and circumstances,
including the results of tax audits and changes in tax law. If the payment of additional taxes and
interest ultimately proves unnecessary or less than the amount of the reserve, the reversal of the
reserves would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period in which we determine the
reserves are no longer necessary. If an estimate of tax reserves proves to be less than the ultimate
assessment, a further charge to income tax provision would result. These adjustments to reserves
and related expenses could materially affect our consolidated financial position and results of
operations.

We recognize the tax benefits from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not
that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities based on the
technical merits of the position. Tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a
position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of
being realized upon the ultimate settlement. We evaluate such likelihood based on relevant facts
and tax law.

See our combined financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in
this offering circular for further discussion.

**_Impairment of Long-Lived Assets_**

For definite-lived intangible assets, such as customer relationships, contracts, intellectual
property, and for other long-lived assets, such as property and equipment, whenever impairment
indicators are present, we perform a review for impairment. We calculate the undiscounted value of
the projected cash flows associated with the asset, or asset group, and compare this estimated
amount to the carrying amount. If the carrying amount is found to be greater, we record an
impairment loss of the excess of book value over the fair value. In addition, in all cases of an
impairment review, we re-evaluate the remaining useful lives of the assets and modify them, as
appropriate.

For indefinite-lived intangible assets, such as trademarks and trade names, each year and
whenever impairment indicators are present, we determine the fair value of the asset and record an
impairment loss for the excess of book value over the fair value, if any. In addition, in all cases of
an impairment review we re-evaluate whether continuing to characterize the asset as indefinite-lived

109


-----

is appropriate. See our combined financial statements and the related notes thereto included
elsewhere in this offering circular for additional details.

_Goodwill_

Goodwill is reviewed for possible impairment at least annually on a reporting unit level during
the fourth quarter of each year, using a measurement date of October 1[st]. A review of goodwill may
be initiated before or after conducting the annual analysis if events or changes in circumstances
indicate the carrying value of goodwill may no longer be recoverable.

We are permitted to conduct a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to
perform a two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test for our annual goodwill impairment test in
the fourth quarter of 2016 and 2015. As such, we performed a qualitative test for all of our reporting
units that have goodwill allocated and determined that the two-step goodwill impairment test is not
necessary for the years ending December 31, 2016 and 2015 for any of our regional reporting units.
If the qualitative factors had indicated that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the
reporting units was less than its carrying amount, we would have tested goodwill for impairment at
the reporting unit level using a quantitative two-step approach.

The quantitative goodwill impairment test involves a two-step process. In step one, we
compare the fair value of each of our reporting units with goodwill to its carrying value, including
the goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying
value, there is no indication of impairment and no further testing is required. If the fair value of the
reporting unit is less than the carrying value, we must perform step two of the impairment test to
measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. In step two, the reporting unit’s fair value is
allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, including any unrecognized
intangible assets, in a hypothetical analysis that calculates the implied fair value of goodwill in the
same manner as if the reporting unit were being acquired in a business combination. If the implied
fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill is less than the carrying value, the difference is recorded
as an impairment loss.

_Self-Insurance_

The obligations for specified claims and losses related to property, casualty, workers’
compensation and employee benefit claims have been allocated to us from Sealed Air based on
headcount. We accrue for outstanding reported claims and claims that have been incurred but not
reported based upon management’s estimates of the aggregate liability for retained losses using
historical experience, insurance companies’ assumptions regarding economic conditions, the
frequency and severity of claims and claim development patterns and settlement practices. These
estimates and assumptions are monitored and evaluated on a periodic basis by management and
are adjusted when warranted by changing circumstances. Although management believes it has the
ability to adequately project and record estimated claim payments, actual results could differ
significantly from the recorded liabilities.

_Pensions_

For a number of our U.S. and international employees, we maintain defined benefit pension
plans. Under current accounting standards, we are required to make assumptions regarding the
valuation of projected benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets for our defined benefit
pension plans.

The projected benefit obligation and the net periodic benefit cost are based on third-party
actuarial assumptions and estimates that are reviewed and approved by management on a
plan-by-plan basis each fiscal year. The principal assumptions concern the discount rate used to

110


-----

measure future obligations, the expected future rate of return on plan assets and the expected rate
of future compensation increases. We revise these assumptions based on an annual evaluation of
long-term trends and market conditions that may have an impact on the cost of providing
retirement benefits.

In determining the discount rate, we utilize market conditions and other data sources
management considers reasonable based upon the profile of the remaining service life of eligible
employees. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is determined by taking into
consideration the weighted-average expected return on our asset allocation, asset return data,
historical return data, and the economic environment. We believe these considerations provide the
basis for reasonable assumptions of the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. The rate
of compensation increase is based on our long-term plans for such increases. The measurement
date used to determine benefit obligations and plan assets is December 31 for all material plans
(November 30 for non-material plans).

At December 31, 2016, the total projected benefit obligation for our U.S. pension plans was
$133.8 million, and the total benefit expense (income) for the year ended December 31, 2016 was
($1.2) million. At December 31, 2016, the total projected benefit obligation for our international
pension plans was $822.7 million, and the total benefit cost for the year ended December 31, 2016
was $3.7 million.

In general, material changes to the principal assumptions could have a material impact on the
costs and liabilities recognized on our combined financial statements.

See our combined financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in
this offering circular for information about our benefit plans. See ‘‘Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed
Combined Financial Information’’ for adjustments relating to pensions as we will not assume all of
the pension liabilities once the Transactions are closed.

**New Accounting Pronouncements**

The following recent accounting pronouncements have been issued but are not yet effective,
and as such, will be applied in future periods. We have not yet determined the effect that any of the
accounting pronouncements will have on our results of operations, statement of financial position,
or financial statement disclosures.

   - In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Intangibles — Goodwill and Other
(Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment (‘‘ASU 2017-04’’). ASU 2017-04
eliminates step 2 as part of the goodwill impairment test. The amount of the impairment
charge to be recognized would now be the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the
reporting unit’s fair value. The loss to be recognized cannot exceed the amount of goodwill
allocated to that reporting unit. The amendments in ASU 2017-04 are effective for annual or
interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. Early
adoption is permitted for interim and annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing
dates after January 1, 2017.

   - In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-01, Business Combinations (Topic 805):
Clarifying the Definition of a Business (‘‘ASU 2017-01’’). ASU 2017-01 provides a screen to
determine when a set is not a business. This screen states that when substantially all of the
fair value of the group assets acquired (or disposed of) is concentrated in a single
identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets, the set is not a business. The
amendments in ASU 2017-01 are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15,
2017, including interim periods within those periods. Early application is permitted for
transactions for which the acquisition date occurs before the issuance date or effective date

111


-----

of the amendments, only when the transaction has not been reported in financial statements
that have been issued.

- In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230):
Restricted Cash (‘‘ASU 2016-18’’). ASU 2016-18 requires that entities include restricted cash
and restricted cash equivalents with cash and cash equivalents in the beginning-of-period
and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. The amendments in
ASU 2016-18 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including
interim reporting periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption, including adoption in
interim periods, is permitted for all entities. Retrospective transition method is to be applied
to each period presented.

- In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity
Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory (‘‘ASU 2016-16’’). ASU 2016-16 requires entities to
recognize income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than
inventory when the transfer occurs. The amendments in ASU 2016-16 are effective for
annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting
periods within those annual reporting periods. Early adoption is permitted for all entities as
of the beginning of an annual reporting period for which financial statements have not been
issued or made available for issuance.

- In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230) —
Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (‘‘ASU 2016-15’’). ASU 2016-15
provides guidance on eight specific cash flow issues in regard to how cash receipts and
cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. The
amendments in ASU 2016-15 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2017, including interim periods within those years, with early adoption permitted.

- In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments — Credit Losses
(Topic 326), Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (‘‘ASU 2016-13’’).
ASU 2016-13 requires entities to measure all expected credit losses for most financial assets
held at the reporting date based on an expected loss model which includes historical
experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Entities will now
use forward-looking information to better form their credit loss estimates. ASU 2016-13 also
requires enhanced disclosures to help financial statement users better understand significant
estimates and judgments used in estimating credit losses, as well as the credit quality and
underwriting standards of an entity’s portfolio. ASU 2016-13 is effective for annual periods
beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal periods.
Entities may adopt earlier as of the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2018, including
interim periods within those fiscal years.

- In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (‘‘ASU 2016-02’’).
ASU 2016-02 requires an entity to recognize a right-of-use asset and lease liability for all
leases with terms of more than 12 months. Recognition, measurement and presentation of
expenses will depend on classification as a finance or operating lease. Similar modifications
have been made to lessor accounting in-line with revenue recognition guidance. The
amendments also require certain quantitative and qualitative disclosures about leasing
arrangements. The amendments in ASU 2016-02 are effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is
permitted. The updated guidance requires a modified retrospective adoption.

- In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers
(Topic 606), (‘‘ASU 2014-09’’) and issued subsequent amendments to the initial guidance in
August 2015, March 2016, April 2016 and May 2016 within ASU 2015-04, ASU 2016-08,

112


-----

ASU 2016-10 and ASU 2016-12, respectively (ASU 2014-09, ASU 2015-04, ASU 2016-08,
ASU 2016-10 and ASU 2016-12 collectively, Topic 606). Previous revenue recognition
guidance in GAAP comprised broad revenue recognition concepts together with numerous
revenue requirements for particular industries or transactions, which sometimes resulted in
different accounting for economically similar transactions. The core principle of the guidance
is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or
services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity
expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, ASU 2014-09
expands and enhances disclosure requirements which require disclosing sufficient
information to enable users of financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing,
and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. This
includes both qualitative and quantitative information. In August 2015, the FASB issued
ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective
Date, (‘‘ASU 2015-14’’). The amendments in ASU 2015-14 delay the effective date of
ASU 2014-09 by one year to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018
for entities other than public business entities, certain not-for-profit entities, and certain
employee benefit plans.

**Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk**

**_Interest Rate Risk_**

We are exposed to market risk associated with changes in interest rates. Historically, we were
subject to interest rate risk associated with the delayed draw tranche of Sealed Air’s Term Loan A
facility. Following the consummation of the Transactions, we will be subject to interest rate risk
associated with our Senior Secured Credit Facilities. We currently do not intend to hedge
borrowings under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities in the near term but we are continuing to
evaluate various hedging strategies that we may put in place in the future with respect to interest
rate risk. While changes in interest rates do not affect the fair value of our variable-interest rate
debt, they do affect future earnings and cash flows. For more information with respect to our Senior
Secured Credit Facilities, see ‘‘Description of Certain Other Indebtedness’’.

Following the Transactions, we will have e545.0 million of fixed rate debt as a result of the
issuance of the notes offered hereby. For fixed rate debt, interest rate changes affect the fair market
value of such debt but do not impact earnings or cash flows.

**_Foreign Currency Risk_**

We conduct operations in many countries around the world. Our results of operations are
subject to both currency transaction risk and currency translation risk. We incur currency
transaction risk when we enter into either a purchase or sale transaction using a currency other
than our functional currency, which is the U.S. dollar. With respect to currency translation risk, our
financial condition and results of operations are measured and recorded in the relevant domestic
currency and then translated into U.S. dollars for inclusion in our combined financial statements.
Exchange rates between these currencies and U.S. dollars have fluctuated significantly over the last
few years and may do so in the future. A substantial portion of our revenue and costs are
denominated in or effectively fluctuate with U.S. dollars, and we also have significant revenue and
costs in euros, Canadian dollars, British pounds and other currencies.

Approximately 80% of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2016 were associated
with operations in jurisdictions that have a currency other than the U.S. dollar.

113


-----

**_Foreign Currency Forward Contracts_**

Our subsidiaries have foreign currency exchange exposure from buying and selling in
currencies other than their functional currencies. We use foreign currency forward contracts to fix
the amounts payable or receivable on some transactions denominated in foreign currencies. Our
foreign currency forward contracts are described in Note 11, ‘‘Derivatives and Hedging Activities’’,
which is contained in the notes to our combined financial statements included elsewhere in this
offering circular.

In connection with the Transactions, we entered into a foreign currency forward contract to fix
the amount receivable with respect to (i) the euro-denominated tranche of the Term Loan Facility
and (ii) the notes offered hereby, which such forward contract fixed the euro-to-dollar exchange rate
at the rate then in effect at the signing of the Purchase Agreement.

**_Interest Rate and Currency Swap_**

In 2014, in connection with exercising the $100 million delayed draw under Sealed Air’s senior
secured credit facility, we entered into a series of interest rate and currency swaps in a notional
amount of $100 million. On September 30, 2016, the first $20 million swap contract matured and
was settled. As a result of the settlement, we received $4.9 million. These swaps convert the U.S.
dollar denominated variable rate obligation under Sealed Air’s senior secured credit facility into a
fixed Brazilian Real-denominated obligation. The delayed draw and the interest rate and currency
swaps were used to fund expansion and general corporate purposes of our Brazilian subsidiaries.

**_Net Investment Hedge_**

During the second quarter of 2015, we entered into a series of foreign currency exchange
forwards totaling e270 million. These foreign currency exchange forwards hedged a portion of the
net investment in a certain European subsidiary against fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and
expired in June 2015. The loss of $3.5 million ($2.2 million after tax) is recorded in accumulated
other comprehensive income on our combined balance sheet.

In March 2015, we entered into a series of cross-currency swaps with a combined notional
amount of $425 million, hedging a portion of the net investment in a certain European subsidiary
against fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The fair value of this hedge as of December 31, 2016
was $(5.3) million ($(3.3) million after tax) on our combined balance sheet.

For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedges of net investments in
foreign operations, settlements and changes in fair values of the derivative instruments are
recognized in unrealized net gains or loss on derivative instruments for net investment hedge, a
component of accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of taxes, to offset the changes in the
values of the net investments being hedged. Any portion of the net investment hedge that is
determined to be ineffective is recorded in other income, net on the combined statements of
operations.

**_Other Derivative Instruments_**

We may use other derivative instruments from time to time to manage exposure to foreign
exchange rates and to access international financing transactions. These instruments can potentially
limit foreign exchange exposure by swapping borrowings denominated in one currency for
borrowings denominated in another currency.

114


-----

**_Commodities_**

We use various commodity raw materials such as plastic resins and other chemicals and
energy products such as electric power and natural gas in conjunction with our manufacturing
processes. Generally, we acquire these components at market prices in the region in which they
will be used and do not use financial instruments to hedge commodity prices. Moreover, we seek to
maintain appropriate levels of commodity raw material inventories thus minimizing the expense and
risks of carrying excess inventories. We do not typically purchase substantial quantities in advance
of production requirements. As a result, we are exposed to market risks related to changes in
commodity prices of these components.

**BUSINESS**

**Company Overview**

We are a leading global provider of high-performance cleaning, sanitation and hygiene
products for the food safety and service, food and beverage plant operations, healthcare, floor care,
housekeeping and room care, laundry and hand care markets. In addition, we offer a wide range of
value-added services, including food safety and application training and consulting, as well as
auditing of hygiene and water management. We serve institutional and industrial end-users such as
food service providers, lodging establishments, food and beverage processing plants, building
service contractors, building managers and property owners, retail outlets, schools and healthcare
facilities globally. We trace our history back to 1886 and since then have predominantly operated
within larger, diversified, product-driven manufacturing companies including Molson, Unilever, SCJ
and most recently, Sealed Air. Although our cleaning products represent only a small portion of our
customers’ total cleaning costs, they are typically viewed as being non-discretionary given they can
have a meaningful impact on the efficacy of cleaning solutions and operational costs.

Our fully integrated suite of solutions combine chemicals, dispensing equipment, cleaning
machines, services and digital analysis across two distinct business product categories:
Professional and Food & Beverage. Our Professional product category, which represented
approximately 76% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2016, develops and delivers
integrated solutions comprised of chemicals, floor care machines, cleaning tools and utensils, and
digitally enabled systems for the institutional and janitorial markets. Our Food & Beverage product
category, which represented approximately 24% of net sales for the year ended December 31,
2016, develops and delivers solutions integrating chemicals, design engineering, cleaning protocols
and equipment, remote data monitoring and predictive analytics for food and beverage
manufacturers.

We are highly diversified across products and services, end-markets and geographies. Our
global operations have broad exposure and a significant presence throughout Europe, North
America, APAC, MEA and Latin America LATAM. We have little reliance on any individual country.
We serve more than 85,000 customers across in excess of 260,000 sites globally. Our extensive
portfolio breadth reduces our exposure to any one solution, with no individual product or service
representing more than 0.9% of total sales for the year ended December 31, 2016. We are further
diversified across stable end-markets, including food service, hospitality, beverages, building
services and healthcare, among others, with no individual end-market accounting for more than
14% of total sales for the year ended December 31, 2016. We believe this high degree of
diversification with low customer concentration has generated revenue stability for us.

We believe that we are differentiated from our competitors by our global footprint that reaches
a diverse customer base, as well as by the integrated high-touch service and end-to-end solutions
we provide, our customized chemical formulations and our extensive suite of dosing and
dispensing equipment. We believe our products improve customers’ operational efficiency and their
cleaning, sanitizing and hygiene results, which has led to deeper customer relationships. Working in
a highly fragmented industry, we have a balance of direct selling capabilities and a global and
regional distribution network that reaches thousands of end-use customers. We have invested in
research that helps us understand our customers’ business needs, which we believe positions us
as an innovator and strong collaborative partner and enables us to deepen our customer
relationships and drive growth.

We are headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina, operate 16 chemical facilities on a global
basis and two equipment plants, and have a global customer facing team of approximately
6,000 employees including sales, marketing and technical service representatives along with
approximately 500 customer service representatives. For the LTM Period on a pro forma basis after

116


-----

giving effect to the Transactions, we generated $2,565.0 million in net sales and $387.1 million in
Further Adjusted EBITDA. See ‘‘Summary—Summary Historical and Pro Forma Financial Data’’ for a
definition of Further Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of our pro forma net income (loss) to
Further Adjusted EBITDA.

The following charts set forth our net sales by product, end-market, region and customer
concentration category for the year ended December 31, 2016.

**_Professional_**

Our Professional product category offers floor and building care chemicals, floor care
machines, cleaning tools, dosing and dispensing equipment, kitchen and mechanical washing
solutions, infection prevention and personal care, fabric care, odor control, carpet care and
restroom care. Our sustainable cleaning and hygiene solutions drive labor productivity, infection
prevention, food safety and enhance the customer experience. In addition to sales of chemicals and
equipment, we offer a range of solutions including engineering, consulting and training services
yielding higher productivity, risk management, data provided through its digital solutions and
sustainability benefits to customers across a wide range of end-markets. Many of the products we
offer in this product category are consumable in nature and require periodic replacement,
generating recurring revenue which we believe provides stability to our business.

We are a global leader in our Professional product category. Based on 2016 net sales, we
believe we held the #1 market position in the Europe, MEA, LATAM and APAC regions and the #2
market position in North America. Our broad footprint, global presence and scale enable us to
consistently serve large global customers with added local insight and regional support to provide a
tailored solution and enhanced high-touch, value-added service offering. Our Professional product
category is focused on serving five primary institutional and industrial sectors globally: food service,
hospitality, facility service, food retail, and healthcare. Key representative customers include ISS,
Aramark, ABM, Sodexo, McDonalds, Walmart and Hilton.

Our extensive suite of cleaning products for the food service market includes chemicals for
washing dishes, utensils and kitchen equipment, food handling and storage products. Our broad
range of floor care products and systems include finishes, waxes and cleaners for all types of
flooring surfaces, including vinyl, granite, concrete, marble and wood. Our floor care products also
include carpet cleaning and floor care machines, utensils and tools, which support floor cleaning

and maintenance process. We also offer a fully integrated line of products and dispensing systems
for hard surface cleaning, disinfecting and sanitizing, handwashing, air deodorizing and freshening
and laundry care. Additionally, we provide technical assistance for efficacious application of these
chemicals and installation of our equipment at the customers’ sites increasing our stickiness with
the customers and thereby providing stability to our revenue base.

We also operate a Consumer Brands business within the Professional product category which
accounted for approximately $250.0 million of our 2016 net sales. This business distributes a broad
range of trusted consumer-branded cleaning and hygiene products such as DOVE Skin and Body
and OMO detergent to professional market customers such as hotels and professional laundries,
among others. As a partner for FMCG companies, including a longstanding strategic partnership
with Unilever, we help create unique FMCG brand experiences for customers in the non-residential
markets (‘‘out-of-home’’). Our focus on creating long-term consumer brand partnerships continues
as evidenced by our newly established agreements with Nakoma and Spectrum.

Our Professional product category accounted for $1,964.1 million, or approximately 76%, of
our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2016. Our gross margin in the Professional product
category for the year ended December 31, 2016 was 44.8%.

**_Food & Beverage_**

Our Food & Beverage product category provides CIP and open plant systems that integrate
cleaning chemicals, lubricants, floor care equipment and cleaning and dispensing tools within the
food and beverage end-market. We offer value-added knowledge-driven engineering and project
design solutions and installations including automated equipment for dosing and distributing
cleaning and sanitation solutions. Our hygiene and engineering solutions are designed to improve
productivity and food safety as well as generate water and energy savings for our customers. To
ensure proper implementation, we employ highly sophisticated technical application experts to help
customers achieve production efficiencies. Although cleaning chemicals represent a small portion of
total overall costs, they can have a high cost of failure due to their significant impact on both the
efficacy of cleaning solutions and operational costs. We believe our customized product offerings
enhance customer retention through mutual investment in infrastructure and solutions.

We are also a global leader in our Food & Beverage product category. Based on 2016 net
sales, we believe we held the #1 position in MEA, #2 in Europe, APAC and LATAM and #3 in
North America. Our global scale enables us to consistently serve large multi-national customers
with added local insights and regional support to ensure a tailored, high-quality solution across
customer sites. Our Food & Beverage product category is focused on serving four key sectors
globally: food processing, beverage companies, dairy, and other food and beverage
establishments. Key representative customers of the Food & Beverage product category include
Coke, Ab InBev, Cargill, Diageo, Pepsi, Nestle, Danone, Kraft, Heinz, Heineken and Unilever.

Our extensive suite of products and services includes detergents, cleaners, sanitizers and
lubricants, as well as cleaning systems, electronic dispensers and chemical injectors for the
application of chemical products and improvement of operational efficiency. Through this platform,
we also offer gel and foam products for manual open plant cleaning, acid and alkaline cleaners and
membrane cleaning products. In addition, we provide consulting services in the areas of food
safety, water and energy use reduction and quality management. Through our data monitoring and
predictive analytics capabilities, we also help customers maximize efficiency of operations as well
as their profitability.

Our Food & Beverage product category accounted for $604.7 million, or approximately 24%,
of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2016. Our gross margin in the Food & Beverage
product category for the year ended December 31, 2016 was 39.7%.

**_Our Operations and Sales Model_**

We manufacture a diverse portfolio of finished goods utilizing a combination of internal
manufacturing sites and strategic contract manufacturing. Our internal manufacturing global
footprint consists of five factories in North America, six factories in Europe, two factories in MEA,
three factories in LATAM and two factories in APAC, which provide a strong base of owned asset
production facilities in established geographies and key emerging markets.

Our manufacturing strategy, which combines both internal and external manufacturing, enables
a flexible and geographically effective supply chain network for our chemical finished goods and
equipment. Contract manufacturing complements our internal manufacturing capability and
supports our existing offerings as well as innovations and new product launches, while limiting
capital investment. We contract with approximately 25 large strategic contract manufacturers which
we believe augments our global supply chain network with additional geographic coverage and
production capabilities. In developed markets, strategic contract manufacturers are used to leverage
variable capacity or for unique production capabilities. In emerging markets, contract manufacturers
provide strategic capacity where we do not yet have critical mass. In addition, we use
approximately 200 third-party manufacturers for sourcing highly unique or specialty products
included in our product portfolio. Our primary raw material inputs include caustic soda, solvents,
waxes, phosphates, surfactants, polymers and resins, chelates and fragrances. We also source
packaging components and equipment and accessories. Our packaging purchases include
bag-in-the-box containers, bottles, corrugated boxes, drums, pails, totes, aerosol cans, caps,
triggers and valves. Our equipment and accessories purchases include dilution control, ware
washing and laundry equipment, floor care machines, air care dispensers, floor care applicators,
mops, microfiber, buckets, carts and other items used in facility maintenance. Where contract
manufacturing is used, the production processes mirror those of our internal manufacturing plants
to ensure quality control. We believe all components related to raw materials, equipment and
accessories are readily available from multiple sources and to the extent possible, we offset higher
costs of materials through pricing increases.

We have long-term relationships with an extensive network of suppliers. Supplier contracts are
typically multiyear, with set pricing and renewal features built in and flexibility to adjust prices on the
basis of underlying fluctuation in raw material costs. The majority of our critical raw material inputs
are common to the industry and produced in all regions by multiple large, global suppliers,
ensuring attractive input prices.

We reach customers via a combination of direct sales channels (which represented
approximately 76% of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2016, including
‘‘ship-through’’ sales, which involve a distributor-facilitated fulfillment where the customer
relationship is managed by Diversey and not the distributor) and distribution channels (which
represented 24% of sales for the year ended December 31, 2016). We employ a balanced
marketing strategy with a strong, global direct sales force as well as a broad network of third-party
distributors in key locations, whereas many of our competitors sell solely or primarily through thirdparty distributors. We believe that this hybrid strategy provides us with access to an extensive range
of customers, while facilitating optimized operations in a cost-effective manner. We employ a
structure of dedicated professionals managing strategic accounts to build long-term customer
relationships. Our manufacturing network is supported by a global customer facing team of
approximately 6,000 employees including sales, marketing and technical service representatives
along with approximately 500 customer service representatives. Our in-house sales force directly
manages relationships with our large global and regional customers while our third-party distributor
partners enable us to reach end-users for which would not be profitable for us to serve directly. We
have invested in extensive training for our direct sales force and the management of our distributor

-----

network, and we support our sales force with a deep bench of training and technical service
representatives.

Our global strategic accounts help differentiate us from our competitors and are a source of
significant profitability and growth through increased customer penetration and new customer wins.
They help us build long-term contractual relationships, set standards of cleaning and hygiene,
facilitate adoption of industry best practices, and provide a platform for local growth. We have 59
global strategic account contracts in place (which represented approximately 20% of our net sales
for the year ended December 31, 2016) and a robust pipeline of strategic accounts with projects
under implementation and opportunities to win substantial incremental sales. Sales growth among
our top 50 customers (based on 2015 net sales, excluding distribution) from January 1, 2015
through December 31, 2016 outpaced sales growth across the entire company over the same
period.

**_Customer Overview_**

Our Professional and Food & Beverage product categories serve customers across a wide
variety of stable and growing end-markets. Approximately three-quarters of our customer
relationships exceed 15 years in length. We have minimal concentration and high customer diversity
as our largest customer accounted for less than 3% of our net sales for the year ended
December 31, 2016, while our top 10 and 50 customers represented only 13% and 30% of our net
sales over the same period, respectively. Our highly fragmented customer base adds to stability of
our orders and revenue streams as activity across different customer groups is very diverse and
independent of activity among other customer categories. Some of our key customers include ISS,
ABM, Aramark, Heineken, Hilton, McDonalds, Nestle, Sodexo, Target and Walmart.

Our end-users span a wide range of business sectors, including food service, lodging, retail,
healthcare, building managers/service contractors, food and beverage, cash and carry
establishments, government institutions, industrial plants and on-premises laundry.

The following charts set forth, for each of our product categories, the end-markets served as a

In addition to providing cleaning and hygiene products, our application expertise, deep
industry process knowledge, and project engineering maximize product and operational efficiency,
resulting in sticky customer relationships. Additionally, we provide customized solutions for
customers which are integrated into customer sites, encouraging mutual investment in infrastructure
and increasing customer loyalty.

**_Research and Development_**

We maintain significant R&D capabilities to ensure we continue to remain an innovator and
technological leader. We develop new products, applications, services, and processes while
providing technical assistance to improve our customers’ operations. We are increasingly leveraging
our digital capabilities in R&D, which we believe further differentiates us from our competitors. Our
value proposition is rooted in the integration of our proprietary technologies with our customers’
manufacturing and service delivery value chain. We have R&D and application support facilities in
locations around the globe, including in North America, South America, Europe and Asia, to
facilitate hands-on interaction with our customers.

Substantially all of our principal products have been sourced and/or developed through R&D
endeavors by our in-house engineering personnel, and we maintain a robust pipeline of new
product development projects, which are in various stages of discovery and development.

R&D expenses were $49.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.

**_Our Digital Innovation Capabilities_**

We maintain a portfolio of smart, connected, and data driven solutions that differentiate us
from our peers and lay the foundation for substantial future growth. Diversey’s digital innovation
initiative, called the ‘‘Internet of Clean’’, uses the ‘Internet of Things’ and robotics to create
differential value for its customers. This initiative intelligently connects facilities, equipment and
people, thereby resulting in improved internal operations and more efficient service. This trend of
digital integration supports improvements in customer productivity and labor savings via smart
cleaning devices and services. We believe we offer an industry-leading suite of innovative digital
products, which include:

Product Description

**IntelliDish** Remote monitoring system to optimize performance, productivity and
resources in commercial dishwashing operations

**IntelliTrail** A web-based GPS tracking solution which enables locating, monitoring and
managing fleets of machines

**Intellibot** Fully autonomous floor cleaning robots that drive safety, productivity and
operational improvement

**IntelliLinen** Reliable precision dosing of products, reporting and remote monitoring
features that drive improvement in fabric care operations

**IntelliCare** Remote maintenance and control of dispensers to optimize refilling, routing
and stock replanning

**IntelliConsult** Modular suite of food safety diagnostic tools and value-added digital
services

**Industry Overview**

We estimate that the global market for traditional cleaning and hygiene products and related
services generated annual industry-wide sales of approximately $32 billion for the year ended

121


-----

December 31, 2016, of which professional comprises approximately $27 billion and food and
beverage the remainder. These figures exclude sales and industry growth related to digital
innovation/Internet of Clean and cleaning machines for the hygiene and cleaning industry. Our
industry has demonstrated stable growth trends over time due to its broad end-market exposure,
the consumable and recurring nature of its products and services, and secular demand driven by
underlying end-market trends such as increased regulation and heightened public awareness of
health, hygiene and infection risk.

We believe that we are one of the two largest global providers of institutional and industrial
cleaning, sanitation and hygiene products and related services globally and in most of the regions
in which we operate. Our industry is highly fragmented, and consists of several regional players
which we believe have a more limited product offering than ours. Large, multi-national customers
seek out our services given our scale, which is another competitive advantage, particularly relative
to competitors with a regional focus.

Our leadership position in these highly fragmented markets gives us an opportunity to make
accretive acquisitions, adding new technologies, end-market capabilities and sales and service
assets to our global platform. We have completed several tuck-in acquisitions over the last few
years and we continue to evaluate new opportunities in every geography.

research and analysis and management’s estimates.

**_Industry Growth Drivers_**

We believe that the Professional and Food & Beverage product categories of the traditional
cleaning and hygiene industry have demonstrated stable growth trends over time due to the
growing importance of hygiene and cleanliness across our highly diversified end-markets and
geographies. Governmental regulations for food safety and customer focus on hygiene and
cleanliness have also increased significantly across the world. Climate change, water scarcity and
environmental concerns have combined to create further demand for products, services and
solutions designed to minimize waste and drive broader sustainability.

We believe that the principal end-markets in which we operate will continue to grow at
attractive rates, supported by a number of key industry trends. The table below sets forth for each
of the end-markets that we serve the percentage of our net sales for the year ended December 31,

(1) Our projected market growth by end-market from 2016 to 2021 is sourced from a leading consulting firm’s research
and analysis, including Global Industry Analysts, IHS and market participants’ published statements.

Industry trends like the high cost of absenteeism, increased hygiene standards, rising HAI
costs, stringent food safety laws, high turnover in facilities management staff and increased
automation and digitization represent key drivers that underpin these expected market growth rates.
Specifically, we see six broad trends driving these growth rates:

   - Food Safety: Combatting the rise and frequency of foodborne illnesses, particularly as the
trend towards fast casual dining continues to grow.

   - Regulatory: Changes in the regulatory environment continue to impact labeling and
classification of chemicals.

   - Infection Prevention: Continued high incidence of HAIs increases demand for continuous
improvements in infection prevention and hand hygiene.

   - Sustainability: Eco resource scarcity is increasingly a concern as the world becomes more
populated and resource needs outpace resource supply. In addition, increased urbanization
is driving greater awareness of resource conservation. This driver is particularly relevant
across all of our Professional product category end-markets, where regulation increasingly
requires sustainable solutions. In addition, our customers are becoming increasingly aware
of ‘‘green cleaning’’, which uses cleaning methods and products with environmentally
friendly ingredients, and procedures which are designed to preserve human health and
environmental quality.

   - Fast Moving Consumer Goods Penetration: Consumers look for products specifically
designed to fit their own unique profiles, needs and lifestyles.

   - Innovation: Shift toward the use of network-connected, physical devices embedded with
electronic, software, sensors and actuators that collect and exchange data, which creates
demand for our unique digitally-enabled solutions.

Although the industry is experiencing some shifting trends, we believe we are well positioned
relative to our global competition. While customers pay for chemicals, we focus on the importance
of providing a comprehensive solution, yielding high productivity, risk management and
sustainability to our customers. We have become an entrenched part of our customers’ value chain
and continue to help them protect their brands and drive profitability.

**Our Competitive Strengths**

**_Global Leader in Large and Fragmented Market — We believe that we are one of the two_**
largest global providers of institutional and industrial cleaning, sanitation and hygiene products and

123


-----

related services. We estimate the size of the market in which we operate to be approximately
$32 billion, and that we hold a leading market position in each of the geographies that we serve.
We believe our scale and strong market position around the world differentiate us from the
numerous smaller local and regional competitors that make up a significant majority of the market,
enabling us to not only provide end-to-end solutions for the diverse needs of our customers but
also to consistently deliver our value-added products, services and solutions to global customers
with multiple points of contact and ensure our quality and standards of service are met across all
customer sites. Our scale and differentiated capabilities also allow us to invest in R&D aimed at
creating next-generation products and services designed to meet the specific needs of our
customers. We focus on designing solutions that deliver meaningful labor, energy and water
savings, thereby reducing customers’ operating costs while also supporting sustainability and
minimizing environmental impact. We are increasingly leveraging our digital capabilities in the
development of these products and services, which we believe further differentiates us from our
competitors.

**_Highly Diversified Across Structurally Attractive End-Markets — We believe that our broad_**
exposure to a variety of attractive and stable end-markets across the globe mitigate the potential
volatility of cyclical downturns in specific industries or regions. We have historically focused on the
more developed European and North American markets, but we are also expanding into higher
growth, emerging markets that are experiencing a greater focus on cleaning and hygiene
standards, thereby providing us an entry point into higher growth environments as compared to the
more mature regions we have historically served. We focus on serving the non-industrial,
non-energy end-markets such as food service, hospitality, beverages, building services and
healthcare, which historically are less prone to volatile swings in performance during periods of
macroeconomic weakness due to such end-markets having more consistent demand through
economic cycles. We believe that this strategy helps mitigate the adverse effects of economic
cycles on our business. In addition to providing this downside protection, we believe these
end-markets will continue to grow at attractive rates in the future supported by a number of key
industry trends that drive demand for Diversey’s products and services.

**_Broad Portfolio of Product and Service Offerings — We believe we offer our customers the_**
most extensive range of cleaning, sanitizing and hygiene products and services, many of which are
consumable and must therefore be periodically replaced. While our products and services generally
represent a small percentage of our customers’ cost structure, our products and services are often
viewed as critical to our customers’ operations and brand protection, particularly in an environment
of increasing regulation and scrutiny of, and concern over, food safety, hygiene and infection
control. In addition, we offer our customers integrated solutions that consist of providing an
on-going supply of customized cleaning chemistries, machines, tools and utensils, as well as
providing installation, maintenance, training and technical support. We believe that these integrated
offerings appeal to our customers because they promote higher productivity and generate
operational savings.

**_Established Long-Term Relationships Across an Attractive Customer Base — The products_**
and services we provide our customers are critical to meeting their cleaning and hygiene needs.
Our customers include many of the largest, most established, and most well-known companies in
their industries, including leading global building service contractors, hotel operators, food and
beverage processors, retail and consumer products companies, educational institutions and
healthcare facilities. Among our largest customers are beverage companies The Coca-Cola
Company and Heineken, pharmaceutical retailer Walgreens and global facilities services providers
ISS and Aramark.

124


-----

While we service many of the largest companies in their respective sectors, our customer base
is highly fragmented, with no single customer representing more than 3% of net sales for the year
ended December 31, 2016, and our ten largest customers representing approximately 13% of net
sales for the same period. In addition, we have been able to maintain long-term relationships with
many of our top customers, promoting a stable and recurring revenue stream. Approximately threequarters of our customer relationships exceed 15 years in length. Our consultative sales and service
model often involves either installation of our technologies at customers’ facilities or investments in
training our customers’ employees to effectively use our products and operate our cleaning
systems. We believe that these investments make us a valuable and entrenched partner to our
customers, providing meaningful incentives for long-term relationships and continued use of our
products, services and solutions. This is evidenced by our consistently high rate of customer
retention, which was on average 98% for our Professional product category, 96% for our Food &
Beverage product category and 98% for our company as a whole, in each case, over the 2015 and
2016 fiscal years.

**_Strong, Resilient Financial Performance and Stable Free Cash Flow Characteristics — We_**
have an attractive financial profile highlighted by our stable and diversified revenue streams,
historical margin expansion and strong free cash flow generation. Our strong free cash flow
generation, which we define as Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditures, is attributable to
attractive gross margins, a high degree of operational leverage across our selling, general and
administrative expenses, and minimal capital expenditures. For the 2015 and 2016 fiscal years, we
converted, on average, approximately 80% of Adjusted EBITDA into free cash flow. Our Adjusted
EBITDA margin expanded approximately 120 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2016
as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. During previous economic cycles, our
diversified business model and flexible cost structure have allowed us to perform well in the cyclical
down-turns in the end-markets we serve. Additionally, the Transactions have been structured in a
tax-efficient manner and are expected to further optimize our required cash tax obligations, following
their consummation. We believe that our business has the capability to support further growth while
also taking advantage of operating leverage and the benefits of the cost rationalization initiatives
described below, all of which we believe will allow us to continue to sustainably generate strong
cash flow.

**_Experienced Management Team with Strong Sponsorship — We are led by a senior_**
management team with significant industry, manufacturing and marketing experience which has
implemented various initiatives that have contributed, and will continue to contribute, to our
operational and financial performance. We will also benefit from the support and expertise of Bain
Capital, which has extensive expertise in investments in industrial companies and carve-out
transactions and has delivered attractive returns to its investors by driving operational improvements
in its portfolio companies. Bain Capital has a successful track record of operating businesses
through transformative periods and is committed to helping us continue to execute on our growth
strategies, broaden our customer reach, continue to innovate and develop new products, and
achieve the expected benefits from the cost rationalization initiatives we intend to undertake.

**Our Business Strategy**

**_Capitalize on Attractive Trends to Drive Growth — Governmental regulations for food safety_**
and disease control and consumer focus on hygiene and cleanliness have both increased
significantly across many of the jurisdictions in which we operate in recent years. Climate change,
water scarcity and environmental concerns have combined to create further demand for products,
services and solutions designed to minimize waste and support broader sustainability. In addition,
many of our customers require tailored cleaning solutions that can assist in reducing labor, energy,
water use and the costs related to cleaning, sanitation and hygiene activities. We help our

125


-----

customers realize efficiencies throughout the operation of their facilities by developing customized
solutions. We are targeting high growth end-markets like healthcare through our registered
disinfection portfolio based on AHP. Our AHP products are targeted for use in hospitals, nursing
homes and other locations where virus outbreaks are most common. We believe that our valueadded customer service approach and proven commitment to providing cost-savings and
sustainable solutions position us well to address these and other critical demand drivers in order to
drive revenue growth.

**_Leverage Our Global Scale to Serve National and Multinational Customers — As a global_**
provider offering a full range of cleaning and hygiene products, services and solutions, we believe
we can leverage our scale and expertise to meet our customers’ increasingly complex needs and
support them as they pursue expansion into new geographies. We believe that a significant
percentage of the total customer base in our industry is served by smaller local and regional
players, many of which we believe lack the breadth of capabilities and scale to compete effectively
long-term in an industry driven by increasingly stringent regulatory and hygiene standards. We have
a long and demonstrated track record of growth with large multinational customers, and we expect
that our global scale will continue to attractively position us to win incremental business from these
customers. Our enhanced focus on global strategic accounts helps differentiate us by building
long-term relationships with global clients, syncing our offerings with client goals, setting industry
standards of cleaning and hygiene and providing a platform for local growth.

**_Continued Focus on Commercial Excellence — We employ a balanced marketing strategy_**
with a strong, global direct sales force complemented by a broad network of third-party distributors
in key locations, whereas the majority of our competitors sell solely or primarily through third-party
distributors. We believe that this hybrid strategy provides us with access to an extensive range of
customers while allowing us to optimize our operations in a cost-effective manner. Our global
strategic accounts have historically driven higher organic growth and we have improved sales force
efficiency by redesigning our operating model and commercial organization. We believe there is
further opportunity to optimize our commercial organization following our separation from Sealed
Air. We believe there is meaningful long-term opportunity to continue improving our commercial
organization to grow our business and solidify our customer relationships — for example, through
integrating CRM systems and eliminating products or services that are not creating value for our
customers.

**_Maintain Our Leadership Through Research and Development and Product Innovation —_**
We intend to build on our portfolio of customized and value-added products, services and solutions
to meet current and future demands of end-users. Under Sealed Air’s ownership, we centralized our
R&D functions, and we believe this reorganization has enhanced our responsiveness to customer
needs and time-to-market in product development. Products we have developed, such as Oxivir
formulations, Clax Xcellence and Advance, and Taski Swingo 2100 and XP, address our customers’
requirements for more cost efficient and environmentally sensitive cleaning solutions and are
important to our ability to maintain loyalty in our existing customer base as well as attract new
customers. These innovations and their commercialization are the outgrowth of the insights we
developed through in-depth attitudinal, behavioral and ethnographic customer research, through
which we applied a new level of market analysis and capabilities to our business. We also
continually evaluate acquisition opportunities to supplement, and further accelerate, our organicallyderived innovation initiatives.

**_Cost Rationalization Initiatives — We plan to leverage the opportunity offered by the_**
carve-out of Diversey from Sealed Air to improve our operations and generate substantial cost
savings as a standalone company. As an independent, service-oriented company, we intend to
enhance and simplify our business processes, rationalize our cost base and focus on initiatives to

126


-----

drive growth and improve financial performance. These initiatives can be grouped into four major
categories: (1) reducing back-office costs, (2) improving our procurement strategy, (3) enhancing
the efficiency of our manufacturing and supply chain networks, and (4) continuing our focus on
improving commercial excellence and sales force productivity. The levers available to us to
implement these initiatives are numerous and include reducing headcount in non-customer facing
areas of our business, consolidating expenditures across our highly fragmented supplier base as
well as rationalizing our manufacturing facility footprint to enhance overall utilization and
performance. Under Sealed Air’s ownership, we lacked control over certain critical business
functions, which limited our ability to optimize many of these factors to suit our standalone business
needs.

We have included in our Further Adjusted EBITDA an estimated approximately $55 million of
benefit from the completion of such initiatives, comprised of $30 million of back office savings
related to headcount rationalization to be implemented in early 2018 and $25 million of chemicals,
equipment and packaging procurement savings to be implemented by the end of 2018. We expect
that there will be additional opportunities to achieve further cost savings through these initiatives as
well as by optimizing our manufacturing and supply chain networks and focusing on productivity
and commercial excellence.

**Manufacturing**

We manufacture a diverse portfolio of finished goods utilizing a combination of both internal
manufacturing sites and strategic contract manufacturing. We maintain a global manufacturing
network, operating 16 chemical facilities on a global basis and two equipment plants, which
provides a strong base of owned asset production in established geographies and key emerging
markets. Our manufacturing network is supported by a global customer facing team of
approximately 6,000 employees, including sales, marketing and technical service representatives
along with approximately 500 customer service representatives.

Contract manufacturing complements our internal manufacturing and supports our diverse set
of offerings as well as new product launches and innovations while limiting capital investment.
Twenty-five large strategic contract manufacturers augment our global supply chain network with
additional geographic coverage and production capability. An additional 200 third-party
manufacturers are utilized for sourcing highly unique or specialty products required for our portfolio.
In developed markets, strategic contract manufacturers are used to leverage variable capacity or for
unique production capabilities. In emerging markets, contract manufacturers provide strategic
capacity where we do not yet have critical mass.

**Raw Materials and Suppliers**

Our products are manufactured internally or sourced externally from suppliers or contractors
enabling a flexible and geographically effective supply chain network for chemical finished goods
and equipment.

Our primary raw material inputs include caustic soda, solvents, waxes, phosphates,
surfactants, polymers and resins, chelates and fragrances, all of which are generally available from
multiple suppliers. We also source components related to equipment and accessories from multiple
suppliers. Where contract manufacturing is used, the production processes mirror those of our
internal plants to ensure quality control, and the raw materials purchased from our supplier
contracts are used.

**Competition**

Our Food & Beverage and Professional solutions face a wide spectrum of competitors across
each product category. Competition is both global and regional in scope and includes numerous
small, local competitors with limited product portfolios and geographic reach. We compete globally
on premium product offerings and application expertise, innovative product and dispensing
equipment offerings, value-added solution delivery, and strong customer service and support. We
differentiate our offerings from competitors by becoming the preferred partner to our customers,
and by providing innovative, industry-leading products to make their facilities safer and healthier for
both maintenance staff and building occupants. We believe our integrated solutions approach,

128


-----

which includes the supply of machines, tools, chemicals, processes and training to customers to
drive productivity improvements, reduce total cost of ownership, reduce risk of food safety events
and improve infection control to reduce healthcare acquired infections, is a unique competitive
strength. Additionally, the quality, ease of use and environmental profile of our products are unique
and have helped support long-standing, profitable relationships with many top customers.

**Intellectual Property**

We strategically manage our portfolio of patents, trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks and
other intellectual property. Specifically, we rely upon trade secrets to protect the formulation of
many of our chemical products, as well as our manufacturing processes. We own or have licenses
under patents and trademarks which are used in connection with our business. Some of these
patents or licenses cover significant product formulations and processes used to manufacture our
products. The trademarks of major products in each business are registered in key jurisdictions or
licensed from third parties. Certain intellectual property is also protected by confidentiality
agreements or other agreements with suppliers, employees and other third parties. In part, our
success can be attributed to the existence and continued protection of these trademarks, patents,
trade secrets and licenses.

We believe that the Diversey trademark is important to our business. We own the Diversey
trademark as used in our business. Other than the Diversey mark, we do not believe that our
overall business is materially dependent on any individual trade name, trademark or patent.

**Employees**

As of May 31, 2017, we had approximately 9,400 employees worldwide. Approximately 1,100
of these employees were in the U.S., and approximately 8,300 employees were outside the U.S. We
believe that our employee relations are satisfactory.

**Environmental Matters, Health and Safety and Governmental Regulations**

As a manufacturer, we are subject to various laws, rules and regulations in the countries,
jurisdictions and localities in which we operate. These cover: the safe storage and use of raw
materials and production chemicals; the release of materials into the environment; standards for the
treatment, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes; or otherwise relate to the protection
of the environment. We review environmental, health and safety laws and regulations pertaining to
our operations and believe that compliance with current environmental and workplace health and
safety laws and regulations has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures or
consolidated financial condition.

In some jurisdictions in which our packaging products are sold or used, laws and regulations
have been adopted or proposed that seek to regulate, among other things, minimum levels of
recycled or reprocessed content and, more generally, the sale or disposal of packaging materials.
We maintain programs designed to comply with these laws and regulations and to monitor their
evolution. Various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations regulate some of our
products and require us to register certain products and comply with specified requirements. In the
U.S., we must register our sanitizing and disinfecting products with the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency. We are also subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and
regulations that regulate products manufactured and sold by us for controlling microbial growth on
humans, animals and processed foods. In the U.S., these requirements are generally administered
by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (‘‘FDA’’). To date, the cost of complying with product
registration requirements and FDA compliance has not had a material adverse effect on our
business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

129


-----

Our emphasis on environmental, health and safety compliance provides us with risk reduction
opportunities and cost savings through asset protection and protection of employees.

**Legal Proceedings**

Diversey is party to routine legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of its
businesses. We believe that none of the claims and complaints of which we are currently aware will,
individually or in the aggregate, materially affect our businesses, financial position, or future
operating results, although no assurance can be given with respect to the ultimate outcome of any
such claims or with respect to the occurrence of any future claims.

$900.0 million tranche and an e820.0 million tranche (or $902.0 million using an exchange rate of

a foreign currency forward contract to fix the amount receivable with respect to (x) the
euro-denominated tranche of the Term Loan Facility and (y) the notes offered hereby, which such
forward contract fixed the euro-to-dollar exchange rate at the rate then in effect at the signing of the

obligations under hedging arrangements and cash management arrangements are expected to be
guaranteed on a joint and several basis by Holdings and certain of our material wholly-owned
restricted subsidiaries organized in (i) Australia, (ii) Austria, (iii) Brazil, (iv) Belgium, (v) Canada,

exceptions.

The Senior Secured Credit Facilities are expected to be secured by, subject to permitted liens
and certain other exceptions, substantially all of the present and after acquired assets of the Issuer
and each of the subsidiary guarantors and a perfected pledge by Holdings of all of the Issuer’s
capital stock, including, (a) a perfected pledge of all the capital stock of each direct, wholly owned
material restricted subsidiary held by the Issuer or any subsidiary guarantor (which pledge, in the
case of any CFC Holding Company or CFC will be limited to 65% of the capital stock of such CFC
Holding Company or CFC) and (b) a perfected security interest in substantially all other tangible
and intangible assets of the Issuer and the subsidiary guarantors (including, but not limited to,
accounts receivable, inventory, equipment, general intangibles, investment property, material owned
real property, intellectual property and the proceeds of the foregoing), in each case subject to
certain exceptions and limitations.

**_Interest Rate and Fees_**

Borrowings under the under the Term Loan Facility are expected to bear interest, at our
option, at (1) the Adjusted LIBOR rate (as defined below) plus 3.00% or EURIBOR, if applicable,
_plus 3.50% or (2) the adjusted base rate (as defined below) plus 2.00%. Borrowings under the_
Revolving Credit Facility are expected to bear interest, at our option, at (1) the Adjusted LIBOR rate
_plus 3.00% or (2) the adjusted base rate plus 2.00%, provided that, following delivery of financial_
statements for our first full fiscal quarter completed after the closing date of the Transactions,
interest rate spreads with respect to the Revolving Credit Facility may be subject to as many as two
25 basis point reductions based upon consolidated first lien net leverage ratios to be mutually
agreed upon between us and the lead arrangers with respect to the Senior Secured Credit
Facilities.

For the purposes of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the ‘‘Adjusted LIBOR rate’’ means the
greater of (i) the London interbank offered rate, adjusted for statutory reserve requirements and
(ii) 0.00%.

For the purposes of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the ‘‘adjusted base rate’’ means the
higher of (i) the U.S. prime rate published in the Wall Street Journal from time to time, (ii) the
federal funds effective rate, plus [1]⁄2 of 1% and (iii) Adjusted LIBOR plus 1.00%.

135


-----

For the purposes of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, ‘‘EURIBOR’’ means the higher of
(i) the rate per annum equal to the Banking Federation of the European union EURIBO rate and
(ii) 0.0%

In addition, we will be required to pay certain upfront and recurring fees with respect to the
Senior Secured Credit Facilities, including fees on the aggregate principal amount of revolving
commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility in effect on such day regardless of usage in the
amount of 0.50% per annum (which fee shall be subject to stepdowns to 0.375% and 0.25% based
upon our consolidated first lien net leverage ratio, at levels to be agreed) and to pay letter of credit
fees on the aggregate face amounts of outstanding letters of credit plus a fronting fee to the issuing
banks.

**_Prepayments_**

We will be required to prepay the Term Loan Facility with 100% of the net cash proceeds of
certain issuances of indebtedness (other than certain permitted indebtedness) and 100% of the net
cash proceeds of certain non-ordinary course asset sales and casualty and condemnation events
(subject to exceptions and customary reinvestment rights), with reductions with respect to asset
sale and casualty and condemnation event proceeds to 50% and 0% based upon achieving
consolidated first lien net leverage ratios to be agreed.

Voluntary prepayments of the Term Loan Facility may be made at any time (subject to
minimum prepayment amounts and customary notice periods) without premium or penalty, other
than customary ‘‘breakage’’ costs, if applicable, except that in the event that within the first six
months after the closing date of the Transactions, (i) any prepayment or repayment of initial term
loans borrowed under the Term Loan Facility occurs with the proceeds of, or any conversion is
made of such initial term loans into, any new or replacement tranche of broadly syndicated senior
secured first lien term loans, or (ii) there is an amendment to the Term Loan Facility, in each case,
the primary purposes of which is to (and which does) reduce the all-in-yield applicable to such
initial term loans (and subject to certain other exceptions), then the initial term loans so prepaid,
repaid or amended will be subject to a prepayment premium of 1.00% of the principal amount
thereof.

**_Unrestricted Subsidiaries_**

The Senior Secured Credit Facilities will contain provisions pursuant to which, so long as no
event of default is continuing or would result therefrom, we will be permitted to designate any
existing or subsequently acquired or organized subsidiary as an ‘‘unrestricted subsidiary’’ and
subsequently re-designate any such unrestricted subsidiary as a restricted subsidiary, provided,
(x) such designation of a restricted subsidiary as an unrestricted subsidiary shall be deemed to
constitute an investment and (y) such redesignation of any unrestricted subsidiary as a restricted
subsidiary shall be deemed to constitute the incurrence of indebtedness and liens of such
subsidiary (and reduction of the value of an outstanding investment). Unrestricted subsidiaries will
not be subject to the mandatory prepayments, representations and warranties, covenants, events of
default or other provisions of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, and the results of operations and
indebtedness of unrestricted subsidiaries will not be taken into account for purposes of calculating
any financial ratios or baskets contained in the Senior Secured Credit Facilities.

**_Covenants and Events of Default_**

The Senior Secured Credit Facilities will contain a number of covenants that, among other
things, will restrict, subject to certain exceptions, the Issuer’s ability and the ability of its restricted
subsidiaries, and solely with respect to (11) below, Holdings’ ability, to: (1) incur additional

136


-----

indebtedness; (2) create liens; (3) effect mergers, liquidations, dissolutions and other fundamental
changes; (4) sell and otherwise dispose of assets; (5) pay dividends and effect stock repurchases
or redemptions of equity interests; (6) make acquisitions and investments; (7) make negative
pledge clauses or place restrictions on our subsidiaries’ ability make distributions and other
payments to us; (8) make voluntary prepayments, redemptions and repurchase of material payment
subordinated debt; (9) amend constating documents and material payment subordinated debt
documents; (10) engage in transactions with affiliates; and (11) maintain passive holding company
status.

The Term Loan Facility will not be subject to a financial covenant. The Revolving Credit Facility
is expected to contain a springing financial covenant requiring compliance with a maximum ratio of
consolidated first lien net indebtedness to consolidated EBITDA of 7.50 to 1.00. The financial
covenant will be tested on the last day of any fiscal quarter (commencing with the second full fiscal
quarter ending after the closing date of the Transactions), only if the aggregate principal amount of
borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility and outstanding letters of credit (excluding issued
and undrawn letters of credit and for the first four full fiscal quarter ending after the closing date of
the Transactions, loans borrowed under the Revolving Credit Facility on the closing date of the
Transactions to fund transaction costs and original issue discount) as of the last day of any such
fiscal quarter exceeds 35% of the total amount of commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility
on such date.

The Senior Secured Credit Facilities will also contain customary affirmative covenants and
events of default for facilities of this type, including relating to a change of control. If an event of
default occurs, the lenders under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities will be entitled to take various
actions, including the acceleration of amounts due under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and
all actions permitted to be taken by secured creditors.

The terms described above with respect to the Senior Secured Credit Facilities are subject to
change and a number of conditions, including the consummation of the Transactions and this
offering. To the extent that any of the conditions with respect to such indebtedness are not satisfied,
such indebtedness may not be available on the terms described herein or at all.

**Subordinated Shareholder Loan**

In connection with the consummation of the Transactions, the immediate parent company of
Holdings will make a subordinated shareholder loan in the amount of approximately $25.2 million to
Holdings using a portion of the proceeds from the Equity Contribution. The loan will be unsecured,
expressly subordinated pursuant to the terms of any third party subordination arrangement to which
the borrower thereunder is, or becomes, a party, and will have a 10-year maturity. The loan will not
bear interest or require any prepayments prior to maturity, provided that the loan may be prepaid
by Holdings at any time without penalty.

**DESCRIPTION OF NOTES**

In this description, (i) the term ‘‘Issuer’’ refers to, Diamond (BC) B.V. and not any of its
Affiliates and (ii) the terms ‘‘we’’, ‘‘our’’ and ‘‘us’’ each refer to the Issuer and its consolidated
Subsidiaries, assuming completion of the Transactions.

The Issuer will issue e545 million of % Senior Notes due 2025 (the ‘‘Notes’’). The Issuer
will issue the Notes under an indenture (the ‘‘Indenture’’) to be dated as of the Issue Date, among
the Issuer, Wilmington Trust, National Association, as trustee (the ‘‘Trustee’’), and Citibank, N.A.,
London Branch, as paying agent, transfer agent and registrar. The Notes will be issued in a private
transaction that will not be subject to the registration requirements of the Securities Act. See
‘‘Transfer Restrictions’’. The Indenture will not be subject to the provisions of the Trust Indenture
Act. Accordingly, the terms of the Notes are to include only those stated in the Indenture.

The following is a summary of certain provisions of the Indenture. Because this is a summary,
it may not contain all the information that is important to you and is subject to, and qualified in its
entirety by reference to, the provisions of the Indenture. You should read the Indenture in its
entirety. Copies of the proposed form of the Indenture are available as described under ‘‘Where You
Can Find More Information’’. You can find the definitions of certain terms used in this description
under ‘‘—Certain Definitions’’.

**Brief Description of the Notes and the Note Guarantees**

The Notes will initially be obligations solely of the Issuer and will not be guaranteed but will be
secured by a lien on certain escrow property, pending completion of the Acquisition. Following the

   - general senior unsecured obligations of the Issuer;

   - pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future senior Indebtedness of the
Issuer;

   - effectively subordinated to all existing and future secured Indebtedness (including
obligations under the Credit Agreement) of the Issuer, to the extent of the value of the

Issuer;

   - unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by each Guarantor; and

   - structurally subordinated to any existing and future Indebtedness, claims of holders of
Preferred Stock and other liabilities of Non-Guarantors.

Following the Escrow Release Date (as defined below), each Note Guarantee by a Guarantor

   - pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future senior Indebtedness of such
Guarantor;

   - effectively subordinated to all secured Indebtedness (including Guarantees of obligations
under the Credit Agreement) of such Guarantor, to the extent of the value of the assets
securing such Indebtedness;

   - senior in right of payment to any existing and future Subordinated Indebtedness of such
Guarantor; and

138


-----

   - structurally subordinated to any existing and future Indebtedness, claims of holders of
Preferred Stock and other liabilities of Non-Guarantors that are Subsidiaries of such
Subsidiary Guarantor.

The obligations and covenants of the Issuer described hereunder are only of the Issuer and
not of Holdings, the direct parent company of the Issuer. Although Holdings is a Guarantor of the
Notes, it is generally not subject to any of the obligations and covenants described hereunder.

**Principal, Maturity and Interest**

The Issuer will issue Notes in minimum denominations of e100,000 and integral multiples of
e1,000 in excess thereof. The rights of holders of beneficial interests in the Notes to receive the
payments on such Notes are subject to the applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream. If
the due date for any payment in respect of any Notes is not a Business Day at the place at which
such payment is due to be paid, the Holder thereof will not be entitled to payment of the amount
due until the next succeeding Business Day at such place, and will not be entitled to any further
interest or other payment as a result of any such delay.

The Issuer will issue an aggregate principal amount of e545 million of Notes on the Issue
Date. The Notes will mature on, 2025. Interest on the Notes will accrue at the rate
per annum set forth on the cover of this offering circular and will be payable, in cash, semi-annually
in arrears on and of each year, commencing on 2018, to Holders of record on the
immediately preceding and respectively. Interest on the Notes will accrue from the
most recent date to which interest has been paid or, if no interest has been paid, from the date of
original issuance. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve
30-day months. Each interest period will end on (but not include) the relevant interest payment
date.

**Additional Notes**

The Issuer may issue additional Notes (the ‘‘Additional Notes’’) from time to time under the
Indenture, subject to compliance with the covenants contained in the Indenture. The Indenture will
provide for the issuance of Additional Notes having identical terms and conditions to the Notes
offered hereby. Additional Notes will be treated as part of the same class as the Notes offered
hereby under the Indenture for all purposes, including waivers, amendments, redemptions and
offers to purchase; provided that Additional Notes will not be issued with the same CUSIP, ISIN or
Common Code, as applicable, as existing Notes unless such Additional Notes are fungible with the
existing Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Unless the context requires otherwise,
references to ‘‘Notes’’ for all purposes of the Indenture and this ‘‘Description of Notes’’ include any
Additional Notes that are actually issued.

**Methods of Receiving Payments on the Notes**

Principal, interest and premium and Additional Amounts, if any, on the Global Notes (as
defined below) will be made by one or more Paying Agents by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the account specified by the registered Holder thereof (being the common
depositary or its nominee for Euroclear and Clearstream).

Principal, interest and premium and Additional Amounts, if any, on any certificated securities
(‘‘Definitive Registered Notes’’) will be payable at the specified office or agency of one or more
Paying Agents maintained for such purposes in the City of London. In addition, interest on the
Definitive Registered Notes may be paid, at the option of the Issuer, by check mailed to the address
of the Holder entitled thereto as shown on the register of Holders of Notes for the Definitive
Registered Notes. See ‘‘—Paying Agent and Registrar for the Notes’’ below.

139


-----

**Paying Agent and Registrar for the Notes**

The Issuer will maintain one or more Paying Agents for the Notes in the City of London
(including the initial Paying Agent). The initial Paying Agent will be Citibank, N.A., London Branch.

The Issuer will also maintain a registrar (the ‘‘Registrar’’) and a transfer agent (the ‘‘Transfer
Agent’’). The initial Registrar and the initial Transfer Agent will be Citibank, N.A., London Branch.
The Registrar will maintain a register reflecting ownership of the Notes outstanding from time to
time, if any, and together with the Transfer Agent, will facilitate transfers of the Notes on behalf of
the Issuer. A register of the Notes shall be left at the registered office of the Issuer. In case of
inconsistency between the register of Notes kept by the Registrar and the one kept by the Issuer at
its registered office, the register kept by the Issuer shall prevail.

The Issuer may change any Paying Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent for the Notes without
prior notice to the Holders of such Notes. However, if and for so long as Notes are listed on the
Exchange (as defined below) and if and to the extent the rules of the Exchange so require, the
Issuer will notify the Exchange of any change of Paying Agent or Registrar in respect of the Notes.
The Issuer will notify the Trustee, in writing, of any change to the Paying Agent or Registrar in
respect of the Notes

**Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption**

This offering will be consummated prior to the consummation of the Acquisition. Concurrently
with the closing of the offering of the Notes on the Issue Date, the Issuer will enter into an escrow
agreement (as amended, supplemented or modified from time to time, the ‘‘Escrow Agreement’’)
with the Trustee and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., acting through its London branch, as escrow
agent (in such capacity, together with its successors, the ‘‘Escrow Agent’’) pursuant to which the
Issuer will deposit, or cause to be deposited, into an Escrow Account the gross proceeds received
by the Issuer from this offering (the ‘‘Notes Proceeds’’). The Bain Capital Fund will issue an
irrevocable equity commitment letter (the ‘‘Equity Commitment Letter’’) to the Issuer that will require
the Bain Capital Fund, upon receipt of a notice of a Special Mandatory Redemption, to transfer an
amount of cash in euro to the Issuer, after taking into account the Notes Proceeds, that will be
sufficient to fund the redemption of all of the Notes upon notice of a Special Mandatory
Redemption at the Special Mandatory Redemption Price on the redemption date set forth in such
notice. The Escrow Account will be pledged on a first-priority basis in favor of the Trustee for the
benefit of itself and the Holders of the Notes pursuant to an escrow account charge dated the Issue
Date among the Issuer, the Trustee and the Escrow Agent; provided, however, that such lien and
security interest shall automatically be released and terminate at such time as the Escrowed
Property is released from the Escrow Account on the Escrow Release Date. The Notes Proceeds
and all other funds, securities, interest, dividends, distributions and other property and payments
credited to the Escrow Account (less any property and/or funds paid in accordance with the Escrow
Agreement) are referred to, collectively, as the ‘‘Escrowed Property’’. The Escrowed Property will be
controlled by the Escrow Agent, on behalf of the Trustee and the Holders.

In addition, the Escrow Agreement will provide that on the date that is three Business Days
prior to the last calendar day of the last full calendar month prior to the Outside Date (unless the
Escrow Release Date has occurred), the Issuer will notify the Trustee and Escrow Agent in writing
that it intends to extend the Outside Date (such notice, an ‘‘Extension Notice’’) through the date
specified in such Extension Notice.

140


-----

In order to cause the Escrow Agent to release the Escrowed Property to the Issuer (the
‘‘Escrow Release’’), the following conditions must be met (the ‘‘Release Conditions’’) on or prior to
the Outside Date:

(i) simultaneously or substantially concurrent with the release of funds from the Escrow
Account to finance the Acquisition, the Acquisition shall have been consummated pursuant to
the Purchase Agreement, without giving effect to any modifications, consents, amendments or
waivers thereto after the Issue Date that are materially adverse to the interests of the Holders
of the Notes (as reasonably determined by the Issuer), it being understood (including with
respect to the second succeeding paragraph) (x) that no reduction of the purchase price in
respect of the Acquisition will be deemed to be materially adverse to the interests of the
Holders of the Notes if any such reduction is less than 10% of the purchase price determined
as of the Issue Date or such reduction is applied to reduce the amount of Indebtedness to be
otherwise incurred to finance the Acquisition and (y) no purchase price or similar adjustment
provisions set forth in the Purchase Agreement shall constitute an increase or a decrease in
the purchase price that is materially adverse to the interests of the Holders of the Notes;

(ii) simultaneously or substantially concurrent with the release of funds from the Escrow
Account to finance the Acquisition, the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities shall have
become effective, all conditions precedent to initial funding shall have been satisfied or waived
(other than the release of the Escrowed Property) and the borrowings under the New Senior
Secured Credit Facilities to be drawn in connection with the Acquisition shall have been made
available to the Issuer;

(iii) the Acquired Companies (as defined in the Purchase Agreement) that will guarantee
the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities as of the consummation of the Acquisition shall also
guarantee the Notes pursuant to a supplemental indenture. The timing for entering into such
supplemental indenture by an Acquired Company shall be subject to any restrictions under
the laws of the jurisdiction of each Acquired Company, as applicable; and

(iv) the Issuer shall have delivered to the Escrow Agent and the Trustee an Officer’s
Certificate certifying that the foregoing conditions have been satisfied and directing the Escrow
Agent to release the Escrowed Property (including investment earnings) to or at the order of
the Issuer.

If the Release Conditions are fulfilled and the Escrow Agent and the Trustee receive the
Officer’s Certificate described above, the Escrow Agent shall release the Escrowed Property
(including investment earnings, if any) to or at the order of the Issuer (the date of such release, the
‘‘Escrow Release Date’’) in accordance with the Escrow Agreement. Upon the Escrow Release, the
Escrow Account shall be reduced to zero.

In the event that:

(i) the Escrow Agent and the Trustee have not received the Officer’s Certificate
described above prior to 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the Outside Date, or

(ii) the Escrow Agent and the Trustee receive, at any time prior to 5:00 p.m. (New York
City time) on the Outside Date, an Officer’s Certificate certifying that (A) the Issuer will not
pursue the consummation of the Acquisition; or (B) the Purchase Agreement has been
amended, modified or waived or any consent granted, in a manner that would be materially
adverse to the Holders of the Notes (as reasonably determined by the Issuer) or the Purchase
Agreement has otherwise been terminated (any such event specified in clause (i) or (ii) being
a ‘‘Special Mandatory Redemption Event’’),

141


-----

then, in each such case, the Escrow Agent, without the requirement of notice to or action by the
Issuer, the Escrow Agent or any other Person, shall notify the Issuer and Trustee and, within one
Business Day, liquidate all Escrowed Property and, on or prior to the Special Mandatory
Redemption Date (as defined below), release the Escrowed Property to the Paying Agent. On the
Business Day following the Special Mandatory Redemption Event, the Issuer (or the Paying Agent
upon the written request of and at the expense of the Issuer) shall (x) notify the Escrow Agent and
the Trustee in writing of the occurrence of the Special Mandatory Redemption Event and (y) deliver
a notice of redemption in accordance with the applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream
to each Holder of Notes that the entire principal amount outstanding of the Notes shall be
redeemed at the Special Mandatory Redemption Price on the date falling two Business Days after
the delivery of such notice (the ‘‘Special Mandatory Redemption Date’’). In the event that the
Special Mandatory Redemption Price payable upon a Special Mandatory Redemption exceeds the
amount of the Escrowed Property, the Bain Capital Fund will be required to fund the accrued and
unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, owing to the holders of the Notes, pursuant to the
Equity Commitment Letter.

Upon the deposit of funds sufficient to pay the Special Mandatory Redemption Price in respect
of the Notes to be redeemed on the Special Mandatory Redemption Date with the Paying Agent on
or before such date, the Notes will cease to bear interest and all rights under the Notes shall
terminate. The Trustee will release to the Paying Agent, and the Paying Agent will release to the
Issuer, any Escrowed Property remaining after redemption of the Notes and payment of fees and
expenses. For the avoidance of doubt, the Issuer will not be required to effect a Special Mandatory
Redemption following the Escrow Release. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Escrow of
Proceeds—In the event that the Acquisition is not consummated on or prior to the Outside Date
and the other Escrow Release Conditions are not satisfied, the notes will be subject to a Special
Mandatory Redemption and, as a result, you may not obtain the return you expect on the notes’’.

If at the time of a Special Mandatory Redemption, the Notes are listed on the Exchange and
the rules of the Exchange so require, the Issuer will notify the Exchange of such Special Mandatory
Redemption and any relevant details relating to such Special Mandatory Redemption.

If at any time the Escrow Account contains cash having an aggregate value in excess of the
Special Mandatory Redemption Price, such excess cash may be released to the Issuer.

No provisions of the Escrow Agreement (including, without limitation, those relating to the
release of the Escrowed Property) may be amended or waived in a manner that would materially
adversely affect the Holders of the Notes (as determined in good faith by the Issuer) without the
consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding.
No provisions of the Indenture with respect to the Issuer’s obligation to redeem the Notes through a
Special Mandatory Redemption may be amended or waived in a manner that would materially
adversely affect the Holders of the Notes without the consent of each Holder of an outstanding
Note affected.

The ability of the Holders of the Notes to realize upon the Escrowed Property may be subject
to the automatic stay and certain other bankruptcy law limitations in the event of a bankruptcy of
the Issuer. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Escrow of Proceeds—If the Issuer commences
a bankruptcy or reorganization case or one is commenced against the Issuer in the United States,
federal bankruptcy laws may prevent the release of the escrowed funds’’ and ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks
Related to the Escrow of Proceeds—If an insolvency case is commenced against the Issuer in the
Netherlands, Dutch insolvency law may prevent the release of the escrowed funds’’.

By its acceptance of the Notes, each Holder shall be deemed to authorize and direct the
Trustee to enter into and perform its obligations under, if any, the Escrow Agreement.

142


-----

For purposes of the foregoing, the following terms have the following meanings:

‘‘Bain Capital Fund’’ means, one or more funds affiliated with Bain Capital.

‘‘Escrow Account’’ means a segregated account, under the control of the Escrow Agent, that
includes only cash in euro and European Government Obligations, free from all Liens other than the
Lien in favor of the Trustee for itself and the benefit of the Holders of the Notes and any Lien in
favor of the Escrow Agent to secure obligations owed to the Escrow Agent in connection with the
Escrow Account or the Escrow Agreement.

‘‘Outside Date’’ means October 16, 2017, as such date may be amended or extended by an
Extension Notice.

‘‘Special Mandatory Redemption Price’’ means 100% of the principal amount of the Notes
being redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, from the Issue
Date to, but excluding, the Special Mandatory Redemption Date.

**Listing**

An initial application has been made to The International Stock Exchange Authority Limited
(the ‘‘Authority’’) for the listing of, and for permission to deal in, the Notes on the Official List of The
International Stock Exchange (the ‘‘Exchange’’), which is operated by the Authority. There is no
assurance that the Notes will be listed on the Official List of the Exchange, that such permission to
deal in the Notes will be granted or that such listing will be maintained. The consummation of this
offering is not contingent upon obtaining such listing or permission.

**Note Guarantees**

Prior to the Escrow Release Date, the Notes will be obligations solely of the Issuer and will not
be guaranteed by any of the Issuer’s subsidiaries. From and after the Escrow Release Date, the
obligations of the Issuer under the Notes and the Indenture will be, jointly and severally, irrevocably,
fully and unconditionally Guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis (the ‘‘Note Guarantees’’) initially
by Holdings and each existing Wholly-Owned Subsidiary that Guarantees the Issuer’s obligations
under the Credit Agreement (other than those organized in Italy), subject to (i) the restrictions or the
laws of the jurisdiction of organization of each Guarantor and (ii) release as provided below or
elsewhere in this ‘‘Description of Notes’’. In addition, certain future Subsidiaries will be required to
Guarantee the Notes to the extent described in ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Guarantees’’.

Each Note Guarantee by a Subsidiary Guarantor will be limited to the maximum amount that
would not render such Subsidiary Guarantor’s obligations subject to avoidance under applicable
fraudulent conveyance provisions of the United States Bankruptcy Code or any comparable
provision of foreign or state law. By virtue of this limitation, a Subsidiary Guarantor’s obligation
under its Note Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the
Notes, or a Subsidiary Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Note Guarantee. See
‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and Our Indebtedness—Enforcing your rights as a
holder of the notes or under the guarantees across multiple jurisdictions may prove difficult or
provide less protection than U.S. bankruptcy law’’ and ‘‘—Each guarantor’s liability under its
guarantees may be reduced to zero, voided or released under certain circumstances, and holders
of notes may not receive any payments from some or all of the guarantors’’. The validity and
enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the liability of each Guarantor will be subject to the
limitations described in ‘‘Limitations on the Enforceability of Guarantees and Certain Insolvency
Considerations’’.

143


-----

The Note Guarantee of a Subsidiary Guarantor will provide by its terms that it will
automatically and unconditionally be released and terminate upon:

(1) any sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation, amalgamation or
merger) of the Capital Stock of such Subsidiary Guarantor after which such Subsidiary
Guarantor is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary, or any sale or other disposition of all or
substantially all the assets of the Subsidiary Guarantor, to a Person other than to the
Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, in each case, if such sale or other disposition is made
in compliance with the provisions of the Indenture;

(2) the designation in accordance with the Indenture of the Subsidiary Guarantor as an
Unrestricted Subsidiary or the occurrence of any event after which the Subsidiary
Guarantor is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary;

(3) defeasance or discharge of the Notes, as provided in ‘‘—Defeasance’’ and
‘‘—Satisfaction and Discharge’’;

(4) such Subsidiary Guarantor being released from (i) all of its obligations under all of its
Guarantees of payment by the Issuer of any Indebtedness of the Issuer under the Credit
Agreement or (ii) in the case of a Note Guarantee made by a Subsidiary Guarantor
(each, an ‘‘Other Guarantee’’) as a result of its Guarantee of other Indebtedness of the
Issuer or a Guarantor pursuant to the covenant entitled ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Limitation
on Guarantees’’, the relevant Indebtedness, except in the case of (i) or (ii), a release as a
result of the repayment in full of the Indebtedness specified in clause (i) or (ii) (it being
understood that a release subject to a contingent reinstatement is still considered a
release, and if any such Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor under the Credit
Agreement or any Other Guarantee is so reinstated, such Note Guarantee shall also be
reinstated); or

(5) (i) the merger, amalgamation or consolidation of any Subsidiary Guarantor with and into
the Issuer or another Subsidiary Guarantor that is the surviving Person in such merger,
amalgamation or consolidation, or (ii) the liquidation or dissolution of such Subsidiary
Guarantor following the transfer of all or substantially all of its assets to the Issuer or
another Subsidiary Guarantor.

Claims of creditors of Non-Guarantors, including trade creditors, secured creditors and
creditors holding debt and guarantees issued by Non-Guarantors, and claims of preferred and
minority stockholders (if any) of Non-Guarantors and claims against joint ventures generally will
have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of Non-Guarantors and joint ventures over the
claims of creditors of the Issuer, including Holders of the Notes. The Notes and each Note
Guarantee therefore will be effectively subordinated to creditors (including trade creditors) and
preferred and minority stockholders (if any) of Non-Guarantors and joint ventures. Although the
Indenture will limit the incurrence of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock of
Restricted Subsidiaries, the limitations will be subject to a number of significant exceptions.
Moreover, the Indenture will not impose any limitation on the incurrence by Restricted Subsidiaries
of liabilities that are not considered Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock under the
Indenture. See ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and Preferred
Stock’’.

For the LTM Period, the Diversey subsidiaries that will not guarantee the Notes represented
approximately 37.1% and 45.9% of Diversey’s consolidated net sales and consolidated Adjusted
EBITDA, respectively. As of March 31, 2017, those non-guarantor subsidiaries accounted for
approximately 34.7% of Diversey’s total assets (excluding assets not being acquired in the
Transactions).

144


-----

**Additional Amounts**

All payments made by the Issuer under or with respect to the Notes, or by any of the
Guarantors under or with respect to any guarantee, will be made free and clear of, and without
withholding or deduction for or on account of, any Tax, unless the withholding or deduction of such
Tax is then required by law. If any deduction or withholding by any applicable withholding agent for
or on account of any Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of any jurisdiction (or any department
or political subdivision thereof or therein) (a) in which the Issuer or any Guarantor is at any time
incorporated or organized, engaged in business for tax purposes or resident for tax purposes or
(b) from or through which payment is made by or on behalf of the Issuer or any Guarantor
(including the jurisdiction of any paying agent) will at any time be required to be made in respect of
any payments made by the Issuer under or with respect to the Notes or any of the Guarantors
under or with respect to any guarantee, including payments of principal, redemption price,
purchase price, interest or premium (each such jurisdiction (or any department or political
subdivision thereof or therein) referred to in (a) or (b) above, a ‘‘Tax Jurisdiction’’), then the Issuer
or the relevant Guarantor, as applicable, will pay such additional amounts (the ‘‘Additional
_Amounts’’) as may be necessary in order that the net amounts received in respect of such_
payments after such withholding, deduction or imposition (including any such withholding,
deduction or imposition in respect of any such Additional Amounts) will equal the respective
amounts that would have been received in respect of such payments in the absence of such
withholding or deduction; provided, however, that no Additional Amounts will be payable with
respect to:

(1) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes would not have been imposed but for the existence
of any actual or deemed (pursuant to applicable Tax law of the relevant Tax Jurisdiction,
such as, if applicable, a connection of a partnership that is attributed to the
partners/beneficial owners) present or former connection between the holder or the
beneficial owner of a Note and the relevant Tax Jurisdiction (including being a resident of
such jurisdiction for Tax purposes), other than the ownership or disposition of such Note,
the enforcement of rights under such Note or under a guarantee or the receipt of any
payments in respect of such Note or a guarantee;

(2) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes were imposed as a result of the presentation of a
Note for payment more than 30 days after the relevant payment is first made available for
payment to the holder (except to the extent that the holder or beneficial owner would
otherwise have been entitled to Additional Amounts had the Note been presented on the
last day of such 30 day period);

(3) any Taxes that are payable otherwise than by deduction or withholding from a payment
on or with respect to the Notes or any Note Guarantee;

(4) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, transfer, personal property or similar Taxes;

(5) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes are imposed or withheld by reason of the failure of
the holder or beneficial owner of Notes to comply with any reasonable written request of
the Issuer addressed to the holder or beneficial owner and made at least 45 days before
any such withholding or deduction would be payable to satisfy any certification,
identification, information or other reporting requirements, whether required by statute,
treaty, regulation or administrative practice of a Tax Jurisdiction, as a precondition to
exemption from, or reduction in the rate of deduction or withholding of, Taxes imposed
by the Tax Jurisdiction (including, without limitation, a certification that the holder or
beneficial owner is not resident in the Tax Jurisdiction), but in each case, only to the
extent the holder or beneficial owner is legally eligible to provide such certification or
documentation;

145


-----

(6) any Taxes that are imposed or withheld pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the
Code as of the date of the Indenture (or any amended or successor version that is
substantively comparable), any regulations promulgated thereunder or any other official
interpretations thereof or any intergovernmental agreements (and any related law,
regulation or official administrative guidance) implementing the foregoing; or

(7) any combination of items (1) through (6) above.

In addition to the foregoing, the Issuer and the Guarantors will also pay the holder any present
or future stamp, issue, registration, court or documentary Taxes, or any other excise or property
Taxes, charges or similar levies (including penalties, additions to tax, interest and any other
reasonable expenses related thereto) which are levied by any Tax Jurisdiction on the execution,
delivery, issuance, or registration of any of the Notes, the Indenture, any guarantee or any other
document or instrument referred to therein, or the receipt of any payments with respect thereto, or
enforcement of, any of the Notes or any guarantee.

If the Issuer or any Guarantor, as the case may be, becomes aware that it will be obligated to
pay Additional Amounts with respect to any payment under or with respect to the Notes or any
guarantee, each of the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor, as the case may be, will deliver to the
Trustee and Paying Agent on a date that is at least 30 days prior to the date of that payment
(unless the obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises less than 45 days prior to that payment
date, in which case the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor shall notify the Trustee and Paying Agent
promptly thereafter) an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable
and the amount estimated to be so payable. The Officer’s Certificate(s) must also set forth any
other information reasonably necessary to enable the Paying Agents to pay Additional Amounts to
holders on the relevant payment date. The Trustee and Paying Agent shall be entitled to rely solely
on such Officer’s Certificate as conclusive proof that such payments are necessary.

The Issuer or the relevant Guarantor, if it is the applicable withholding agent, will make all
withholdings and deductions required by law and will remit the full amount deducted or withheld to
the relevant Tax authority in accordance with applicable law. The Issuer or the relevant Guarantor
will use its reasonable efforts to obtain Tax receipts from each Tax authority evidencing the payment
of any Taxes so deducted or withheld. The Issuer or the relevant Guarantor will furnish to the
Trustee or to a holder upon reasonable written request, within a reasonable time after the date the
payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld is made, certified copies of Tax receipts evidencing
payment by the Issuer or a Guarantor, as the case may be, or if, notwithstanding such entity’s
efforts to obtain receipts, receipts are not obtained, other reasonable evidence of payments by such
entity. Upon reasonable request, copies of Tax receipts or other evidence of payments, as the case
may be, will be made available by the Issuer to any holder.

Whenever in the Indenture or in this ‘‘Description of Notes’’ there is mentioned, in any context,
the payment of amounts based upon the principal amount of the Notes or of principal, interest or of
any other amount payable under, or with respect to, any of the Notes or any guarantee. such
mention shall be deemed to include mention of the payment of Additional Amounts to the extent
that, in such context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.

The above obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the indenture,
any transfer by a holder or beneficial owner of its Notes, and will apply, mutatis mutandis, to any
successor Person to the Issuer or any Guarantor and to any jurisdiction in which any successor
Person to the Issuer or any Guarantor is incorporated or organized, engaged in business for tax
purposes or resident for tax purposes or any jurisdiction from or through which any payment on the
Notes (or any guarantee) is made by or on behalf of such Person, and any department or political
subdivision thereof or therein.

146


-----

**Optional Redemption**

Except as set forth in the next four paragraphs, the Notes are not redeemable at the option of
the Issuer.

At any time and from time to time prior to, 2020, the Issuer may on one or more
occasions redeem the Notes in whole or in part, at its option, at a redemption price equal to 100%
of the principal amount of the Notes redeemed, plus the Applicable Premium, plus accrued and
unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date.

At any time and from time to time on and after, 2020, the Issuer may on one or
more occasions redeem the Notes in whole or in part, at its option, at a redemption price equal to
the percentage of principal amount of the Notes redeemed set forth below, plus accrued and
unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the applicable date of redemption,
if redeemed during the 12-month period beginning on of each of the years indicated below:

Redemption
Year Price

2020 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . %
2021 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . %
2022 and thereafter . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 100.000%

At any time and from time to time prior to, 2020, the Issuer may, at its option,
redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes issued under the Indenture
(including any Additional Notes issued after the Issue Date) at a redemption price equal to %
of the principal amount of the Notes redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional
Amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date with the net cash proceeds received by, or
contributed to, the Issuer from one or more Equity Offerings; provided that:

(1) in each case the redemption takes place not later than 180 days after the closing of the
related Equity Offering, and

(2) not less than 50% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Notes issued under
the Indenture (including any Additional Notes issued after the Issue Date) remains
outstanding immediately thereafter (excluding Notes held by the Issuer or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with any tender offer for the Notes, including a
Change of Control Offer or Asset Disposition Offer, if Holders of not less than 90% in aggregate
principal amount of the outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in such
tender offer and the Issuer, or any third party making such tender offer in lieu of the Issuer,
purchases all of the Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such Holders, the Issuer or such
third party will have the right upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, given not
more than 30 days following such purchase date, to redeem all Notes that remain outstanding
following such purchase at a redemption price equal to the price offered to each other Holder in
such tender offer plus, to the extent not included in the tender offer payment, accrued and unpaid
interest and Additional Amounts, if any, thereon, to, but not including, the date of such redemption.

All notices of optional redemption will be provided as set forth under ‘‘—Selection and Notice’’
below.

147


-----

Any optional redemption and notice of optional redemption may, at the Issuer’s discretion, be
subject to the satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent (including, in the case of a
redemption related to an Equity Offering, incurrence of Indebtedness or in connection with other
transactions (or series of related transactions) or an event that constitutes a Change of Control, the
consummation of such Equity Offering, incurrence of Indebtedness, Change of Control or other
transactions). In addition, if such redemption is subject to satisfaction of one or more conditions
precedent, such notice will describe each such condition, and if applicable, will state that, in the
Issuer’s discretion, the redemption date may be delayed until such time (including more than
60 days after the date the notice of redemption was mailed or delivered, including by electronic
transmission) as any or all such conditions are satisfied, or such redemption may not occur and
such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions are not satisfied by such
redemption date, or by the redemption date as so delayed, or such notice may be rescinded at any
time in the Issuer’s discretion if in the good faith judgment of the Issuer any or all of such
conditions will not be satisfied. In addition, the Issuer may provide in such notice that payment of
the redemption price and performance of the Issuer’s obligations with respect to such redemption
may be performed by another Person.

If the optional redemption date is after the relevant record date and on or before the related
interest payment date, the accrued and unpaid interest will be paid to the Person in whose name
the Note is registered at the close of business on such record date, and no additional interest will
be payable to Holders whose Notes will be subject to redemption by the Issuer.

Unless the Issuer defaults in the payment of the redemption price, interest will cease to accrue
on the Notes or portions thereof called for redemption on the applicable redemption date.

**Redemption Upon a Tax Event**

The Issuer may redeem any series of Notes, in whole but not in part, at its option, at any time
upon giving not less than 30 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice to the Holders of the Notes (which
notice will be irrevocable) at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes
being redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the date of redemption (‘‘Tax
_Event Redemption Date’’) and all Additional Amounts (if any) then due and which will become due_
on the Tax Event Redemption Date as a result of the redemption or otherwise (subject to the right
of Holders of the Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest
payment date occurring on or prior to the redemption date and Additional Amounts (if any) in
respect thereof), if, on the next date on which any amount would be payable in respect of the
Notes, the Issuer is or would be required to pay Additional Amounts in respect of the Notes and
cannot avoid such payment obligation by taking reasonable measures available to the Issuer, and
such requirement arises as a result of:

(1) any amendment to, or change in, the laws (or any regulations or rulings promulgated
thereunder) of a relevant Tax Jurisdiction, which change or amendment is announced
and becomes effective after the Issue Date (or, if the applicable Tax Jurisdiction became
a Tax Jurisdiction on a date after the Issue Date, after such later date); or

(2) any amendment to, or change in, an official written interpretation or application of such
laws, regulations or rulings (including by virtue of a holding, judgment or order by a
court of competent jurisdiction or a change in published administrative practice), which
amendment or change is announced and becomes effective after the Issue Date (or, if
the applicable Tax Jurisdiction became a Tax Jurisdiction on a date after the Issue Date,
after such later date).

The Issuer will not give any such notice of redemption earlier than 60 days prior to the earliest
date on which the Issuer would be obligated to pay Additional Amounts if a payment in respect of

148


-----

the Notes was then due, and the obligation to pay Additional Amounts must be in effect at the time
such notice is given. Prior to the publication or, where relevant, mailing of any notice of redemption
of the Notes pursuant to the foregoing, the Issuer will deliver to the Trustee an opinion of
independent tax counsel of recognized standing in the relevant Tax Jurisdiction to the effect that
there has been an amendment or change described in clause (1) or (2) above. In addition, before
the Issuer publishes or mails notice of redemption of the Notes as described above, the Issuer will
deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate to the effect that the Issuer cannot avoid the obligation
to pay Additional Amounts by taking reasonable measures available to it. The Trustee shall accept,
and will be entitled to conclusively rely on, such an Opinion of Counsel and such Officer’s
Certificate as sufficient evidence of the existence and satisfaction of the conditions precedent
described in clause (1) or (2) above, as applicable, and upon delivery of such Opinion of Counsel
and Officer’s Certificate to the Trustee the Issuer will be entitled to give notice of redemption
hereunder and such notice of redemption will be conclusive and binding on the Holders of the
Notes.

**Sinking Fund**

Except as set forth under the caption ‘‘—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory
Redemption’’, the Issuer is not required to make mandatory redemption payments or sinking fund
payments with respect to the Notes. However, under certain circumstances, the Issuer may be
required to offer to purchase Notes as described under the captions ‘‘—Change of Control’’ and
‘‘—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock’’. The Issuer may at any
time and from time to time purchase Notes in the open market or otherwise.

**Selection and Notice**

If less than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, the Paying Agent will select the
Notes for redemption in compliance with the requirements of the principal securities exchange, if
any, on which the Notes are listed, as certified to the Paying Agent by the Issuer, and in compliance
with the requirements of Euroclear and Clearstream, or if the Notes are not so listed or such
exchange prescribes no method of selection and the Notes are not held through Euroclear and
Clearstream or Euroclear and Clearstream prescribe no method of selection, on a pro rata basis,
subject to adjustments so that no Note in an unauthorized denomination remains outstanding after
such redemption; provided, however, that no Note of e100,000 in aggregate principal amount or
less shall be redeemed in part and only Notes in integral multiples of e1,000 shall be redeemed.
The Trustee, the Paying Agent and the Registrar shall not be liable for selections made under this
paragraph.

Notices of redemption will be delivered electronically or mailed by first-class mail at least
30 days but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each Holder of Notes to be
redeemed at the address of such Holder appearing in the security register or otherwise in
accordance with the applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, except that redemption
notices may be delivered electronically or mailed more than 60 days prior to a redemption date if
the notice is (a) issued in connection with a defeasance of the Notes or a satisfaction and
discharge of the Indenture or (b) subject to one or more conditions precedent and such redemption
date is delayed until such time as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied (or waived by the
Issuer in its sole discretion), as described above.

If and for so long as any Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange and if and to the
extent the rules of the Exchange so require, the Issuer will notify the Exchange of any such notice
to the Holders of the relevant Notes and, in connection with any redemption, the Issuer will notify
the Exchange of any change in the principal amount of Notes outstanding.

149


-----

If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that Note
shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed, in which case a portion of
the original Note will be issued in the name of the Holder thereof upon cancellation of the original
Note. In the case of a global note, an appropriate notation will be made on such Note to decrease
the principal amount thereof to an amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof. Subject to the
terms of the applicable redemption notice (including any conditions contained therein), Notes called
for redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption. On and after the redemption date,
unless the Issuer defaults in the payment of the redemption price, interest ceases to accrue on
Notes or portions of them called for redemption.

**Change of Control**

The Indenture will provide that if a Change of Control occurs after the Issue Date, subject to
the exceptions described below, the Issuer will make an offer to purchase all of the Notes pursuant
to the offer described below (the ‘‘Change of Control Offer’’) at a price in cash equal to 101% of the
aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if
any, to, but excluding, the date of repurchase, subject to the right of Holders of the Notes of record
on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date occurring
on or prior to the repurchase date. Within 30 days following any Change of Control, the Issuer will
deliver notice of such Change of Control Offer electronically or by first-class mail, with a copy to the
Trustee and Paying Agent, to each Holder of Notes at the address of such Holder appearing in the
security register as provided under ‘‘—Selection and Notice’’, describing the transaction or
transactions that constitute the Change of Control and offering to repurchase the Notes for the
specified purchase price on the date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than
30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is delivered, subject to extension (in
the case where such notice is mailed or otherwise delivered prior to the occurrence of a Change of
Control) in the event that the occurrence of the Change of Control is delayed, pursuant to the
procedures required by the Indenture and described in such notice.

The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the
Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws or
regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to a Change of
Control Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the
provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and
regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by
virtue thereof.

Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Indenture will not contain
provisions that permit the Holders of the Notes to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the
Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction.

We expect that the Credit Agreement will, and future credit agreements or other agreements to
which the Issuer becomes a party may, provide that certain change of control events with respect
to the Issuer would constitute a default thereunder and that the Credit Agreement and future credit
agreements or other agreements may prohibit or limit the Issuer from purchasing any Notes
pursuant to this covenant. In the event the Issuer is prohibited from purchasing the Notes, the
Issuer could seek the consent of its lenders to the purchase of the Notes or could attempt to
refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If the Issuer does not obtain such consent
or repay such borrowings, it will remain prohibited from purchasing the Notes. In such case, the
Issuer’s failure to purchase tendered Notes would constitute an Event of Default under the
Indenture.

150


-----

Our ability to pay cash to the Holders of Notes following the occurrence of a Change of
Control may be limited by our then-existing financial resources. Therefore, sufficient funds may not
be available when necessary to make any required repurchases of the Notes. The Change of
Control purchase feature of the Notes may in certain circumstances make more difficult or
discourage a sale or takeover of us and, thus, the removal of incumbent management. The Change
of Control purchase feature is a result of negotiations between the initial purchasers and us. We
have no present intention to engage in a transaction involving a Change of Control after the Issue
Date, although it is possible that we could decide to do so in the future. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks
Related to the Notes and Our Indebtedness—The Issuer may be unable to repurchase the notes
upon a change of control’’.

Subject to the limitations discussed below, we could, in the future, enter into certain
transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute
a Change of Control under the Indenture, but that could increase the amount of Indebtedness
outstanding at such time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on
our ability to incur additional Indebtedness, including Secured Indebtedness, are contained in the
covenants described under ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock
and Preferred Stock’’ and ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens’’. Such restrictions in the
Indenture can be waived only with the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal
amount of the Notes then outstanding. Except for the limitations contained in such covenants,
however, the Indenture will not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford Holders of the
Notes protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Related to
the Notes and Our Indebtedness—We can enter into transactions like recapitalizations,
reorganizations and other highly leveraged transactions that do not constitute a change of control
but that could adversely affect the holders of the notes’’.

The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of
Control if (1) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and
otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of
Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under
such Change of Control Offer or (2) a notice of redemption of all outstanding Notes has been given
pursuant to the Indenture as described above under the caption ‘‘—Optional Redemption’’, unless
and until there is a default in the payment of the redemption price on the applicable redemption
date or the redemption is not consummated due to the failure of a condition precedent contained in
the applicable redemption notice to be satisfied. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a
Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditional upon such
Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time of
making of the Change of Control Offer.

If Holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes validly
tender and do not withdraw such Notes in a Change of Control Offer and the Issuer, or any third
party making a Change of Control Offer in lieu of the Issuer as described above, purchases all of
the Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such Holders, the Issuer or such third party will
have the right, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, given not more than
30 days following such purchase pursuant to the Change of Control Offer described above, to
redeem all Notes that remain outstanding following such purchase at a price in cash equal to 101%
of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional
Amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the date of redemption.

The definition of ‘‘Change of Control’’ includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the
assets of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any Person. Although there is a
limited body of case law interpreting the phrase ‘‘substantially all’’, there is no precise established
definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a

151


-----

degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of ‘‘all or
substantially all’’ of the assets of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. As a result, it
may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder of Notes
may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above. See ‘‘Risk
Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and Our Indebtedness—Holders of notes may not be able to
determine when a change of control giving rise to their right to have the notes purchased has
occurred following a sale of ‘‘substantially all’’ of our assets’’.

The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to
repurchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified at any time
with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes
then outstanding.

**Certain Covenants**

Set forth below are summaries of certain covenants that will be contained in the Indenture.

**_Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status_**

Following the first day:

(a) the Notes have achieved Investment Grade Status; and

(b) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing under the Indenture,

then, beginning on that day (each such day, a ‘‘Suspension Date’’) and continuing until any
Reversion Date (as defined below), the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to
the provisions of the Indenture summarized under the following headings (collectively, the
‘‘Suspended Covenants’’):

   - ‘‘—Limitation on Restricted Payments’’,

   - ‘‘—Limitation on Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock’’,

   - ‘‘—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries’’,

   - ‘‘—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions’’,

   - ‘‘—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock’’,

   - ‘‘—Limitation on Guarantees’’, and

   - the provisions of clause (3) of the first paragraph of ‘‘—Merger and Consolidation’’.

Additionally, upon the occurrence of an event resulting in Suspended Covenants, the amount
of Excess Proceeds from Net Available Cash shall be reset to zero.

If on any date following a Suspension Date the Notes cease to have such Investment Grade
Status (any such date, a ‘‘Reversion Date’’), then the Suspended Covenants will thereafter be
reinstated and be applicable pursuant to the terms of the Indenture (including in connection with
performing any calculation or assessment to determine compliance with the terms of the Indenture),
unless and until the Notes subsequently attain Investment Grade Status and no Default or Event of
Default is in existence (in which event the Suspended Covenants shall no longer be in effect for
such time that the Notes maintain an Investment Grade Status); provided, however, that no Default,
Event of Default or breach of any kind shall be deemed to exist under the Indenture, the Notes or
the Note Guarantees with respect to the Suspended Covenants based on, and none of the Issuer
or any of its Subsidiaries shall bear any liability for, any actions taken or events occurring during the
Suspension Period (as defined below), or any actions taken at any time pursuant to any contractual

152


-----

obligation arising prior to the applicable Reversion Date, regardless of whether such actions or
events would have been permitted if the applicable Suspended Covenants remained in effect during
such period. The period of time between a Suspension Date and a Reversion Date is referred to as
the ‘‘Suspension Period’’.

On any Reversion Date, all Indebtedness Incurred during the applicable Suspension Period
will be deemed to have been outstanding on the Escrow Release Date, so that it is classified as
permitted under clause (4)(b) of the second paragraph of ‘‘—Limitation on Indebtedness,
Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock’’. Calculations made after the Reversion Date of the amount
available to be made as Restricted Payments under ‘‘—Limitation on Restricted Payments’’ will be
made as though the covenants described under ‘‘—Limitation on Restricted Payments’’ had been in
effect since the Escrow Release Date prior to, but not during, the Suspension Period; provided, that
no Subsidiaries may be designated as Unrestricted Subsidiaries during the Suspension Period,
unless such designation would have complied with the covenant described under ‘‘—Limitation on
Restricted Subsidiaries’’ as if such covenant would have been in effect during such period.
Accordingly, Restricted Payments made during the Suspension Period will not reduce the amount
available to be made as Restricted Payments under the covenant described under ‘‘—Limitation on
Restricted Payments’’. Any Affiliate Transaction entered into on and after the Reversion Date
pursuant to an agreement entered into during any Suspension Period shall be deemed to be
permitted pursuant to clause (6) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under
‘‘—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions’’. Any encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any
Restricted Subsidiary to take any action described in clauses (1) through (3) of the first paragraph
of the covenant described under ‘‘—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted
Subsidiaries’’ that becomes effective during any Suspension Period shall be deemed to be
permitted pursuant to clause (1)(b) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under
‘‘—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries’’ on and after any
Reversion Date. During the Suspension Period, any future obligation to grant further Note
Guarantees shall be suspended. All such further obligation to grant Note Guarantees shall be
reinstated upon the Reversion Date, but no Subsidiary of the Issuer shall be required to comply
with the covenant described under ‘‘—Limitation on Guarantees’’ after the end of a Suspension
Period with respect to any Guarantee entered into by such Subsidiary during any Suspension
Period.

There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever achieve or maintain Investment Grade
Status. The Trustee shall have no duty to monitor the ratings of the Notes or notify Holders of the
occurrence of a Suspension Date or Reversion Date.

**_Limitation on Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, Incur any
Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) and the Issuer will not issue any shares of
Disqualified Stock and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to issue any shares of Disqualified
Stock or Preferred Stock; provided, however, that the Issuer may Incur Indebtedness (including
Acquired Indebtedness) and issue shares of Disqualified Stock, and any Restricted Subsidiary may
incur Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness), issue shares of Disqualified Stock and issue
shares of Preferred Stock if, on the date of such Incurrence and after giving Pro Forma Effect
thereto, the Consolidated Coverage Ratio for the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries for the most
recently ended Test Period at the time of such Incurrence is no less than 2.00 to 1.00; provided,
_further, that Restricted Subsidiaries that are Non-Guarantors may not Incur Indebtedness (including_
Acquired Indebtedness) or issue shares of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock pursuant to this
paragraph if, after giving Pro Forma Effect to such Incurrence (including the pro forma application
of net proceeds therefrom), the aggregate principal amount of Indebtedness (including Acquired

153


-----

Indebtedness), Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock of Non-Guarantors that would be outstanding
at the time of such Incurrence pursuant to this paragraph, together with the aggregate principal
amount of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock outstanding in reliance upon
clause (5)(x) of the second paragraph of this covenant, would exceed the greater of
(a) $160.0 million and (b) 40.0% of Consolidated EBITDA for the most recently ended Test Period
(calculated on a Pro Forma Basis) at the time of such Incurrence.

The foregoing limitations will not apply to:

(1) Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility, including letters of credit or
bankers’ acceptances issued or created under any such Credit Facility and Guarantees
in respect of such Indebtedness, in an aggregate outstanding principal amount at the
time of Incurrence not greater than $2,052.0 million, plus the greater of (a) $387.0 million
and (b) Consolidated EBITDA of the Issuer for the most recently ended Test Period, so
long as immediately after giving effect to any such incurrence and the application of net
proceeds therefrom the Consolidated Secured Net Leverage Ratio does not exceed 4.50
to 1.00 (provided that any cash proceeds of any new Indebtedness then being Incurred
shall not be netted from the numerator in the Consolidated Secured Net Leverage Ratio
under this clause (1)(b) for purposes of determining whether such Indebtedness can be
Incurred);

(2) Guarantees by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of Indebtedness of the Issuer or
any Restricted Subsidiary so long as the Incurrence of such Indebtedness is permitted
under the terms of the Indenture;

(3) Indebtedness of the Issuer owing to, or Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock of the
Issuer issued to, and held by any Restricted Subsidiary or Indebtedness of a Restricted
Subsidiary owing to, or Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary
issued to, and held by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; provided, however, that:

(a) any subsequent issuance or transfer of Capital Stock or any other event which
results in any such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock being held
by a Person other than the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary; and

(b) any sale or other transfer of any such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred
Stock to a Person other than the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary (other than any
pledge of such Indebtedness or Capital Stock constituting a Permitted Lien),

shall be deemed, in each case, to constitute an Incurrence of such Indebtedness,
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (to the extent such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock
or Preferred Stock is then outstanding) by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as
the case may be;

(4) Indebtedness represented by (a) the Notes (other than any Additional Notes), including
any Note Guarantee thereof, (b) any Indebtedness (other than Indebtedness incurred
pursuant to clauses (1) and (3) above) outstanding on the Escrow Release Date,
(c) Refinancing Indebtedness Incurred in respect of any Indebtedness described in this
clause (4) or clauses (5) or (9) of this paragraph or Incurred pursuant to the first
paragraph of this covenant, and (d) Management Advances;

(5) (x) Indebtedness and Disqualified Stock Incurred by the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary, and Preferred Stock, Incurred by any Restricted Subsidiary, to finance an
acquisition, merger, amalgamation, consolidation; provided that the aggregate principal
amount of Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness), Disqualified Stock and
Preferred Stock that may be Incurred pursuant to the foregoing clause (x), together with

154


-----

the aggregate principal amount of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock
outstanding in reliance upon the first paragraph of this covenant, in each case, by
Non-Guarantors shall not exceed the greater of (A) $140.0 million and (B) 35.0% of
Consolidated EBITDA for the most recently ended Test Period (calculated on a Pro
Forma Basis) or (y) Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock of Persons that
are acquired by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in accordance with the terms
hereof (including designating an Unrestricted Subsidiary a Restricted Subsidiary), which
Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock exists at the time of such acquisition
and is not created in contemplation thereof; provided that, after giving effect to such
acquisition, merger, amalgamation, consolidation or designation described in this
clause (5), on a Pro Forma Basis:

(a) the Issuer would be permitted to Incur at least $1.00 of additional Indebtedness
pursuant to the Consolidated Coverage Ratio test set forth in the first paragraph of
this covenant,

(b) the Consolidated Coverage Ratio of the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries as of
the most recently ended Test Period would not be lower than the Consolidated
Coverage Ratio immediately prior to such acquisition, merger, amalgamation,
consolidation, Investment or designation,

(c) the Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio of the Issuer and the Restricted
Subsidiaries is not greater than 5.80 to 1.00 as of the most recently ended Test
Period; provided that any cash proceeds of any new Indebtedness, Disqualified
Stock or Preferred Stock then being Incurred shall not be netted from the numerator
in the Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio for purposes of calculating the
Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio under this clause (5)(c) for purposes of
determining whether such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock can
be Incurred,

(d) the Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio of the Issuer and the Restricted
Subsidiaries as of the most recently ended Test Period would not be higher than
immediately prior to such acquisition, merger, amalgamation, consolidation or
designation; provided that any cash proceeds of any new Indebtedness,
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock then being Incurred shall not be netted from
the numerator in the Total Net Leverage Ratio for purposes of calculating the
Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio under this clause (5)(d) for purposes of
determining whether such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock can
be Incurred, or

(e) in the case of Indebtedness, such Indebtedness constitutes Acquired Indebtedness
(other than Indebtedness Incurred in contemplation of the transaction or series of
related transactions pursuant to which such Person became a Restricted Subsidiary
or was otherwise acquired by the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary); provided that
the only obligors with respect to such Indebtedness shall be those Persons who
were obligors (or required to be obligors) of such Indebtedness prior to such
acquisition, merger, amalgamation or consolidation;

(6) Hedging Obligations (excluding Hedging Obligations entered into for speculative
purposes);

(7) Indebtedness and Disqualified Stock Incurred by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary
and Preferred Stock Incurred by any Restricted Subsidiary, in each case represented by
Capitalized Lease Obligations (in the case of Indebtedness) or Purchase Money

155


-----

Obligations in an aggregate outstanding principal amount which, when taken together
with the principal amount of all other Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and Preferred
Stock Incurred pursuant to this clause and then outstanding, does not exceed the
greater of (a) $120.0 million and (b) 30.0% of Consolidated EBITDA for the most recently
ended Test Period (calculated on a Pro Forma Basis) at the time of Incurrence and any
Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof; provided that Capitalized Lease Obligations
Incurred by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary pursuant to this clause (7) in
connection with a Permitted Sale and Leaseback shall not be subject to the foregoing
limitation so long as the net cash proceeds of such Permitted Sale and Leaseback are
used by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary to permanently repay outstanding term
loans under any Credit Facility or other Indebtedness secured by a Lien on the assets
subject to such Permitted Sale and Leaseback;

(8) Indebtedness in respect of (a) workers’ compensation claims, self-insurance obligations,
performance, indemnity, surety, judgment, appeal, advance payment, customs, value
added or other tax or other guarantees or other similar bonds, instruments or obligations
and completion guarantees and warranties provided by the Issuer or a Restricted
Subsidiary or relating to liabilities, obligations or guarantees Incurred in the ordinary
course of business or consistent with past practice; (b) the honoring by a bank or other
financial institution of a check, draft or similar instrument drawn against insufficient funds
in the ordinary course of business or consistent with past practice; provided, however,
that such Indebtedness is extinguished within five Business Days of Incurrence;
(c) customer deposits and advance payments received in the ordinary course of
business or consistent with past practice from customers for goods or services
purchased in the ordinary course of business or consistent with past practice; (d) letters

issued or relating to liabilities or obligations Incurred in the ordinary course of business
or consistent with past practice; and (e) any customary treasury, depositary, cash
management, automatic clearinghouse arrangements, overdraft protections, cash pooling
or netting or setting off arrangements or similar arrangements in the ordinary course of
business or consistent with past practice, including financial accommodations of the type
described in the definition of ‘‘Cash Management Services’’ or ‘‘Bank Products’’;

(9) Indebtedness arising from agreements providing for guarantees, indemnification,
obligations in respect of earn-outs or other adjustments of purchase price or, in each
case, similar obligations, in each case, Incurred or assumed in connection with the

such acquisition or disposition);

and Preferred Stock of any Restricted Subsidiary, in an aggregate outstanding principal
amount which, when taken together with the principal amount of all other Indebtedness
Incurred pursuant to this clause and then outstanding, will not exceed 100% of the net
cash proceeds received by the Issuer from the issuance or sale (other than to a
Restricted Subsidiary) of its Subordinated Shareholder Funding or Capital Stock (other
than Disqualified Stock, Designated Preferred Stock or an Excluded Contribution) or
otherwise contributed to the equity (other than through the issuance of Disqualified
Stock, Designated Preferred Stock or an Excluded Contribution) of the Issuer, in each
case, subsequent to the Escrow Release Date, and any Refinancing Indebtedness in
respect thereof; provided, however, that any such net cash proceeds that are so received

156


-----

or contributed shall not increase the amount available for making Restricted Payments to
the extent the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries Incur Indebtedness in reliance
thereon;

(11) Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock of Non-Guarantors in an aggregate
principal amount not to exceed at any one time outstanding the greater of
(a) $140.0 million and (b) 35.0% of Consolidated EBITDA for the most recently ended
Test Period (calculated on a Pro Forma Basis) at the time of Incurrence and any
Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof (it being understood that any Indebtedness,
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock Incurred pursuant to this clause (11) shall cease to
be deemed Incurred for purposes of this clause (11) but shall be deemed Incurred for
the purposes of the first paragraph of this covenant from and after the first date on which
such Non-Guarantor could have Incurred such Indebtedness under the first paragraph of
this covenant without reliance on this clause (11));

director, manager or consultant), to finance the purchase or redemption of Capital Stock
of the Issuer or any Parent Entity that is permitted by the covenant described below
under ‘‘—Limitation on Restricted Payments’’;

(13) Indebtedness of the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries consisting of (i) the

Forma Basis); and

(19) to the extent constituting Indebtedness, all premiums (if any), interest (including
Post-Petition Interest), fees, expenses, charges and additional or contingent interest on
obligations described in clauses (1) through (18) above.

For purposes of determining compliance with, and the outstanding principal amount of any
particular Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to and in compliance with, this covenant:

(1) subject to clause (3) below, in the event that all or any portion of any item of
Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock meets the criteria of more than one
of the types of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock described in the first
and second paragraphs of this covenant, the Issuer, in its sole discretion, will classify,
and may from time to time reclassify, such item (or portion of such item) of Indebtedness
and only be required to include the amount and type of such Indebtedness, Disqualified
Stock or Preferred Stock in one of the clauses of the second paragraph or the first
paragraph of this covenant;

(2) subject to clause (3) below, additionally, all or any portion of any item of Indebtedness,
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock may later be classified as having been Incurred
pursuant to any type of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock described in
the first and second paragraphs of this covenant so long as such Indebtedness is
permitted to be Incurred pursuant to such provision at the time of reclassification;

(3) all Indebtedness outstanding on the Escrow Release Date under the Credit Agreement
shall be deemed to have been Incurred on the Escrow Release Date under clause (1) of
the second paragraph of the description of this covenant and may not be reclassified at
any time pursuant to clause (1) or (2) of this paragraph;

(4) in the case of any Refinancing of any Indebtedness, such Indebtedness shall not include
the aggregate amount of fees, underwriting discounts, premiums and other costs and
expenses Incurred in connection with such Refinancing;

(5) Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other
similar instruments relating to, or Liens securing, Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or
Preferred Stock that is otherwise included in the determination of a particular amount of
Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock shall not be included;

(6) if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar
instruments are Incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being treated as Incurred
pursuant to clause (1), (10), (11) or (14) of the second paragraph above or the first
paragraph above and the letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar
instruments relate to other Indebtedness, then such other Indebtedness shall not be
included;

(7) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, or
Preferred Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary, will be equal to the greater of the maximum
mandatory redemption or repurchase price (not including, in either case, any redemption
or repurchase premium) or the liquidation preference thereof;

158


-----

(8) Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock permitted by this covenant need
not be permitted solely by reference to one provision permitting such Indebtedness,
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock but may be permitted in part by one such provision
and in part by one or more other provisions of this covenant permitting such
Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock;

(9) the amount of any Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock outstanding as of
any date shall be (a) the accreted value thereof in the case of any Indebtedness issued
with original issue discount and (b) the principal amount of Indebtedness, Disqualified
Stock or Preferred Stock, or liquidation preference thereof, in the case of any other
Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock;

(10) in the event an item of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (or any
portion thereof) is Incurred pursuant to the second paragraph of this covenant on the
same date that an item of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (or any
portion thereof) is Incurred under the first paragraph of this covenant or clauses (1) or
(5) above, then the Consolidated Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Secured Net
Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio, as the case may be, will be
calculated with respect to such Incurrence under the first paragraph of this covenant or
clauses (1) or (5) above without regard to any Incurrence under the second paragraph of
this covenant. Unless the Issuer elects otherwise, the Incurrence of Indebtedness,
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock will be deemed Incurred first under the first
paragraph of this covenant or clauses (1) or (5) to the extent permitted, with the balance
Incurred under the second paragraph of this covenant;

(11) in the event that the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary enters into or increases
commitments under a revolving credit facility, enters into any commitment to Incur or
issue Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock or commits to Incur any Lien
pursuant to clause (30) of the definition of ‘‘Permitted Liens’’, the incurrence or issuance
thereof for all purposes under the Indenture, including, without limitation, for purposes of
calculating the Consolidated Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Secured Net Leverage
Ratio or the Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio, as applicable, or usage of
clauses (1) through (19) of the preceding paragraph (if any) for borrowings and
reborrowings thereunder (and including issuance and creation of letters of credit and
bankers’ acceptances thereunder) will, at the Issuer’s option as notified to the Trustee in
writing, either (i) be determined on the date of such revolving credit facility or such entry
into or increase in commitments (assuming that the full amount thereof has been
borrowed as of such date) or other Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock,
and, if such Consolidated Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Secured Net Leverage Ratio
or the Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio, as applicable, test or other provision of the
Indenture is satisfied with respect thereto at such time, any borrowing or reborrowing
thereunder (and the issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances
thereunder) will be permitted under this covenant irrespective of the Consolidated
Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Secured Net Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated Total
Net Leverage Ratio, as applicable, or other provision of the Indenture at the time of any
borrowing or reborrowing (or issuance or creation of letters of credit or bankers’
acceptances thereunder) (the committed amount permitted to be borrowed or
reborrowed (and the issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances)
on a date pursuant to the operation of this clause (i) shall be the ‘‘Reserved
Indebtedness Amount’’ as of such date for purposes of the Consolidated Coverage Ratio,
the Consolidated Secured Net Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated Total Net Leverage
Ratio, as applicable) or (ii) be determined on the date such amount is borrowed pursuant

159


-----

to any such facility or increased commitment, and in each case, the Issuer may revoke
such determination at any time and from time to time as notified to the Trustee in writing;
and

(12) notwithstanding anything in this covenant to the contrary, in the case of any
Indebtedness incurred to refinance Indebtedness initially incurred in reliance on a clause
of the second paragraph of this covenant measured by reference to a percentage of
Total Assets or Consolidated EBITDA at the time of Incurrence, if such refinancing would
cause the percentage of Total Assets or Consolidated EBITDA restriction to be exceeded
if calculated based on the percentage of Total Assets or Consolidated EBITDA on the
date of such refinancing, such percentage of Total Assets or Consolidated EBITDA
restriction shall not be deemed to be exceeded so long as the principal amount of such
refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount of such Indebtedness
being refinanced, plus premiums (including tender premiums), defeasance, costs and
fees in connection with such refinancing.

Accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or
amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional
Indebtedness, the payment of dividends in the form of additional shares of Preferred Stock or
Disqualified Stock or the reclassification of commitments or obligations not treated as Indebtedness
due to a change in GAAP, will in each case not be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness for
purposes of the covenant described under this ‘‘—Limitation on Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock
and Preferred Stock’’.

If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness,
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock of such Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by a
Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer as of such date (and, if such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or
Preferred Stock is not permitted to be Incurred as of such date under the covenant described under
this ‘‘Limitation on Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock’’, the Issuer shall be in
default of this covenant).

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness
that the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed
to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal
amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in the same
currency as the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency
exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was originally incurred, in the case of term
indebtedness, or first committed, in the case of revolving credit indebtedness. The principal amount
of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency
from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate
applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in
effect on the date of such refinancing.

The Indenture will provide that the Issuer will not, and will not permit any Subsidiary Guarantor
to, Incur any Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) that is subordinated or junior in right
of payment to any Indebtedness of the Issuer or such Subsidiary Guarantor, as the case may be,
unless such Indebtedness is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes or such
Subsidiary Guarantor’s Note Guarantee to the extent and in the same manner as such
Indebtedness is subordinated to other Indebtedness of the Issuer or such Subsidiary Guarantor, as
the case may be.

The Indenture will not treat (1) unsecured Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to Secured
Indebtedness merely because it is unsecured or (2) senior Indebtedness as subordinated or junior

160


-----

to any other senior Indebtedness merely because it has a junior priority with respect to the same
collateral or is secured by different collateral.

**_Limitation on Restricted Payments_**

Subordinated Indebtedness in an aggregate amount pursuant to this clause (20) not to
exceed the greater of (x) $80.0 million and (y) 20.0% of Consolidated EBITDA for the
most recently ended Test Period (calculated on a Pro Forma Basis) at the time such
purchase, repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other acquisition or retirement is
made;

(21) AHYDO Payments with respect to Indebtedness permitted under ‘‘—Limitation on
Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock’’;

(22) Restricted Payments by the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries pursuant to
Intercompany License Agreements; or

(23) the declaration and payment of dividends or distributions by the Issuer to, or the making
of loans or advances to, any Parent Entity in amounts required for any such Parent Entity
(or such Parent Entity’s direct or indirect equity owners) to pay:

(a) (i) franchise, excise and similar taxes, and other fees and expenses, required to
maintain a Parent Entity’s corporate, legal and organizational existence including
legal and accounting and other costs directly attributable to maintaining its
corporate, legal, or organizational existence and out-of-pocket costs attributable to
the preparation of tax returns, or

(b) for any taxable period for which the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries are
members of a consolidated, combined, unitary or similar income tax group of which
a Parent Entity is the common parent (a ‘‘Tax Group’’), the portion of any income
Taxes of such Tax Group for such taxable period that are attributable to the taxable
income of the Issuer and/or the applicable Restricted Subsidiaries (and, to the
extent permitted below, the applicable Unrestricted Subsidiaries); provided that for
each taxable period, (A) the amount of such payments made in respect of such
taxable period in the aggregate will not exceed the amount that the Issuer and the
applicable Restricted Subsidiaries (and, to the extent permitted below, the
applicable Unrestricted Subsidiaries), would have been required to pay in respect of
such taxable income as stand-alone taxpayers or a stand-alone tax group and
(B) the amount of such payments made in respect of an Unrestricted Subsidiary will
be permitted only to the extent that cash distributions were made by such
Unrestricted Subsidiary to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary for such purpose;

_provided that at the time of, and after giving effect to, any Restricted Payment permitted under_
clauses (17), (18) and (20), no Event of Default (or in the case of a Restricted Investment, no Event
of Default under clauses (1), (2) or (5) under ‘‘Events of Default’’) shall have occurred and be
continuing or would occur as a consequence thereof.

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, in the event that a Restricted
Payment (or portion thereof) or Investment (or portion thereof) meets the criteria of more than one
of the categories of Permitted Payments described in clauses (1) through (23) above, or is
permitted pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant and/or one or more of the exceptions
contained in the definition of ‘‘Permitted Investments’’, the Issuer will be entitled to classify such
Restricted Payment (or portion thereof) or Investment (or portion thereof) on the date of its
payment, or later reclassify such Restricted Payment (or portion thereof) or Investment (or portion
thereof), among such clauses (1) through (23) above, the first paragraph of this covenant and/or

168


-----

one or more exceptions contained in the definition of ‘‘Permitted Investments’’, in any manner that
otherwise complies with this covenant.

The amount of all Restricted Payments (other than cash) shall be the fair market value on the
date of such Restricted Payment of the asset(s) or securities proposed to be paid, transferred or
issued by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, pursuant to such Restricted
Payment. The fair market value of any cash Restricted Payment shall be its face amount, and the
fair market value of any non-cash Restricted Payment, property or assets other than cash shall be
determined conclusively by the Board of Directors of the Issuer acting in good faith.

**_Limitation on Liens_**

Holdings will not, and will not permit the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor
to, directly or indirectly, create, Incur or permit to exist any Lien (except Permitted Liens) (each, an
‘‘Initial Lien’’) that secures Obligations under any Indebtedness or any related Guarantee, on any
asset or property of Holdings, the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor, unless:

(1) in the case of Liens securing Subordinated Indebtedness, the Notes and related Note
Guarantees are secured by a Lien on such property, assets or proceeds that is senior in
priority to such Liens; or

(2) in all other cases, the Notes or the Note Guarantees are equally and ratably secured.

Any Lien created for the benefit of Holders of the Notes pursuant to the preceding sentence
shall provide by its terms that such Lien shall be automatically and unconditionally released and
discharged upon the release and discharge of the Initial Lien.

With respect to any Lien securing Indebtedness that was permitted to secure such
Indebtedness at the time of the Incurrence of such Indebtedness, such Lien shall also be permitted
to secure any Increased Amount of such Indebtedness. The ‘‘Increased Amount’’ of any
Indebtedness shall mean any increase in the amount of such Indebtedness in connection with any
accrual of interest, the accretion of accreted value, the amortization of original issue discount, the
payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness with the same terms, the accretion of
original issue discount or liquidation preference and increases in the amount of Indebtedness
outstanding solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies or increases in the
value of property securing Indebtedness.

**_Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, create or otherwise cause
or permit to exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or consensual restriction on
the ability of any such Restricted Subsidiary to:

(A) pay dividends or make any other distributions to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary
that is a Subsidiary Guarantor in cash or otherwise on its Capital Stock or pay any
Indebtedness or other obligations owed to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary that is
a Subsidiary Guarantor;

(B) make any loans or advances to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary that is a
Subsidiary Guarantor; or

(C) sell, lease or transfer any of its property or assets to the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary that is a Subsidiary Guarantor;

_provided that (x) the priority of any Preferred Stock in receiving dividends or liquidating distributions_
prior to dividends or liquidating distributions being paid on common stock and (y) the subordination

169


-----

of (including the application of any standstill requirements to) loans or advances made to the Issuer
or any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Subsidiary Guarantor to other Indebtedness Incurred by the
Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Subsidiary Guarantor shall not be deemed to constitute
such an encumbrance or restriction.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not prohibit:

(1) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to (a) any Credit Facility (including the Credit
Agreement), or (b) any other agreement or instrument, in each case, in effect at or
entered into on the Issue Date (or contractual encumbrances or restrictions with respect
to the Transactions in effect on the Escrow Release Date);

(2) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to the Indenture, the Notes and the Note
Guarantees;

(3) encumbrances or restrictions arising or existing by reason of applicable law, rule,
regulation or order, or required by any regulatory authority;

(4) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement or instrument of a Person or
relating to any Capital Stock or Indebtedness of a Person, entered into on or before the
date on which such Person was acquired by or merged, consolidated or otherwise
combined with or into the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, or was designated as a
Restricted Subsidiary or on which such agreement or instrument is assumed by the
Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in connection with an acquisition of assets (other than
Capital Stock or Indebtedness Incurred as consideration in, or to provide all or any
portion of the funds utilized to consummate, the transaction or series of related
transactions pursuant to which such Person became a Restricted Subsidiary or was
acquired by the Issuer or was merged, consolidated or otherwise combined with or into
the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary or entered into in contemplation of or in
connection with such transaction) and outstanding on such date; provided that, for the
purposes of this clause, if another Person is the successor entity, any Subsidiary thereof
or agreement or instrument of such Person or any such Subsidiary shall be deemed
acquired or assumed by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary when such Person
becomes the successor entity;

(5) any encumbrance or restriction:

(a) that restricts in a customary manner the subletting, assignment or transfer of any
property or asset that is subject to a lease, license or similar contract or agreement,
or the assignment or transfer of any lease, license or other contract or agreement;

(b) contained in mortgages, pledges, charges or other security agreements permitted
under the Indenture or securing Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Restricted
Subsidiary permitted under the Indenture to the extent such encumbrances or
restrictions restrict the transfer or encumbrance of the property or assets subject to
such mortgages, pledges, charges or other security agreements; or

(c) pursuant to customary provisions restricting dispositions of real property interests
set forth in any reciprocal easement agreements of the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary;

(6) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to Purchase Money Obligations and Capitalized
Lease Obligations permitted under the Indenture, in each case, that impose
encumbrances or restrictions on the property so acquired, any replacements of such
property or assets and additions and accessions thereto, after-acquired property subject
to such arrangement, the proceeds and the products thereof and customary security

170


-----

deposits in respect thereof and in the case of multiple financings of equipment provided
by any lender, other equipment financed by such lender;

(7) any encumbrance or restriction imposed on the Capital Stock or assets of the Issuer or
any Restricted Subsidiary pursuant to an agreement entered into for the direct or indirect
sale or disposition to a Person of such Capital Stock or assets pending the closing of
such sale or disposition;

(8) customary provisions in leases, subleases, licenses, sublicenses, shareholder
agreements, joint venture agreements, organizational documents and other similar
agreements and instruments;

(9) encumbrances or restrictions arising or existing by reason of applicable law or any
applicable rule, regulation or order, or required by any regulatory authority;

(10) any encumbrance or restriction on cash or other deposits or net worth imposed by
customers under agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business or
consistent with past practice;

(11) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to Hedging Obligations;

(12) other Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock of Non-Guarantors permitted to
be Incurred or issued subsequent to the Escrow Release Date pursuant to the provisions
of the covenant described under ‘‘—Limitation on Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and
Preferred Stock’’ that impose restrictions solely on the Non-Guarantors party thereto or
their Subsidiaries;

(13) restrictions created in connection with any Qualified Securitization Financing or
Receivables Facility that, in the good faith determination of the Issuer, are necessary or
advisable to effect such Securitization Facility or Receivables Facility, as the case may
be;

(14) any encumbrance or restriction arising pursuant to an agreement or instrument (which, if
it relates to any Indebtedness, shall only be permitted if such Indebtedness is permitted
to be Incurred pursuant to the provisions of the covenant described under ‘‘—Limitation
on Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock’’) if the encumbrances and
restrictions contained in any such agreement or instrument taken as a whole (i) are not
materially less favorable to the Holders than the encumbrances and restrictions
contained in the Credit Agreement, together with the security documents associated
therewith as in effect on the Escrow Release Date (as determined by the Issuer) or
(ii) either (a) the Issuer determines at the time of entry into such agreement or instrument
that such encumbrances or restrictions do not materially impair the Issuer’s ability to
make principal or interest payments on the Notes as and when due (as determined in
good faith by the Issuer) or (b) such encumbrance or restriction applies only during the
continuance of a default relating to such agreement or instrument;

(15) any encumbrance or restriction existing by reason of any lien permitted under
‘‘—Limitation on Liens’’; or

(16) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement or instrument effecting a
refinancing of Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to, or that otherwise refinances, an
agreement or instrument referred to in clauses (1) to (15) of this paragraph or this clause
(an ‘‘Initial Agreement’’) or contained in any amendment, modification, restatement,
renewal, increase, supplement, refunding, replacement, refinancing or other modification
to an agreement referred to in clauses (1) to (15) of this paragraph or this clause (16);
_provided, however, that the encumbrances and restrictions with respect to such_

171


-----

Restricted Subsidiary contained in any such agreement or instrument are not materially
less favorable to the Holders taken as a whole than the encumbrances and restrictions
contained in the Initial Agreement or Initial Agreements to which such amendment,
modification, restatement, renewal, increase, supplement, refunding, replacement,
refinancing or other modification relates (as determined in good faith by the Issuer).

**_Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, consummate any
Asset Disposition unless:

(1) the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, receives consideration
(including by way of relief from, or by any other Person assuming responsibility for, any
liabilities, contingent or otherwise) at least equal to the fair market value (such fair market
value to be determined on the date of contractually agreeing to such Asset Disposition
as determined in good faith by the Issuer) of the shares and assets subject to such Asset
Disposition (including, for the avoidance of doubt, if such Asset Disposition is a Permitted
Asset Swap);

(2) in any such Asset Disposition or series of related Asset Dispositions (except to the extent
the Asset Disposition is a Permitted Asset Swap) if the property or assets sold or
otherwise disposed of have a fair market value in excess of $40.0 million, at least 75% of
the consideration from such Asset Disposition, together with all other Asset Dispositions
since the Escrow Release Date (on a cumulative basis), (including by way of relief from,
or by any other Person assuming responsibility for, any liabilities, contingent or
otherwise), received by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, is
in the form of cash or Cash Equivalents; and

(3) the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, at its respective option, will apply an
amount equal to such Net Available Cash from any Asset Disposition:

(a) (i) to prepay, repay, redeem or purchase any Indebtedness of a Non-Guarantor or
Indebtedness that is secured by a Lien (in each case, other than Indebtedness
owed to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary) or Indebtedness under the Credit
Agreement (or any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof) within 540 days
from the later of (A) the date of such Asset Disposition and (B) the receipt of such
Net Available Cash; provided, however, that, in connection with any prepayment,
repayment, redemption or purchase of Indebtedness pursuant to this clause (a), the
Issuer or Restricted Subsidiary will retire such Indebtedness and will cause the
related commitment (if any) to be reduced in an amount equal to the principal
amount so prepaid, repaid, redeemed or purchased; or (ii) to prepay, repay, redeem
or purchase Pari Passu Indebtedness; provided, further, that, to the extent the Issuer
or any Restricted Subsidiary prepays, repays, redeems, or purchases Pari Passu
Indebtedness pursuant to this clause (ii), the Issuer shall equally and ratably reduce
Obligations under the Notes as provided under ‘‘Optional Redemption’’, through
open-market purchases (to the extent such purchases are at or above 100% of the
principal amount thereof) or by making an offer (in accordance with the procedures
set forth below for an Asset Disposition Offer) to all Holders to purchase their Notes
at 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus the amount of accrued but unpaid
interest, if any, on the amount of Notes that would otherwise be purchased to, but
excluding, the date of purchase; and/or

(b) to invest in or commit to invest in Additional Assets within 540 days from the later of
(i) the date of such Asset Disposition and (ii) the receipt of such Net Available Cash;

172


-----

provided, however, that a binding agreement shall be treated as a permitted
application of Net Available Cash from the date of such commitment with the good
faith expectation that such Net Available Cash will be applied to satisfy such
commitment within 180 days of such commitment (an ‘‘Acceptable Commitment’’)
and, in the event that any Acceptable Commitment is later cancelled or terminated
for any reason before the Net Available Cash is applied in connection therewith,
then such Net Available Cash shall constitute Excess Proceeds unless the Issuer or
such Restricted Subsidiary enters into another Acceptable Commitment (a ‘‘Second
_Commitment’’) within 180 days of such cancellation or termination; provided further_
that if any Second Commitment is later cancelled or terminated for any reason
before such Net Available Cash is applied, then such Net Available Cash shall
constitute Excess Proceeds;

_provided that, pending the final application of any such Net Available Cash in accordance with_
clause (a) or clause (b) above, the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries may temporarily reduce
Indebtedness or otherwise use such Net Available Cash in any manner not prohibited by the
Indenture.

If an amount equal to the Net Available Cash from Asset Dispositions is not applied or
invested or committed to be applied or invested as provided, and within the time period (including
as extended) set forth in the preceding paragraph (it being understood that any portion of such
amount used to make an offer to purchase Notes, as described in clauses (3)(a)(i) and (iii) of the
immediately preceding paragraph, will be deemed to have been applied whether or not such offer
is accepted), then such amount not applied or invested or committed to be applied or invested will
be deemed to constitute ‘‘Excess Proceeds’’ under the Indenture. When the aggregate amount of
Excess Proceeds under the Indenture exceeds $60.0 million in any fiscal year, the Issuer will within
10 Business Days be required to make an offer (an ‘‘Asset Disposition Offer’’) to all Holders of the
Notes and, to the extent the Issuer elects or is required to by the terms of any Pari Passu
Indebtedness, to holders or lenders of any other outstanding Pari Passu Indebtedness, to purchase
(or redeem or repay, as applicable) the maximum aggregate principal amount of the Notes and any
such Pari Passu Indebtedness to which such Asset Disposition Offer applies that may be purchased
out of the Excess Proceeds at an offer price in cash in an amount equal to 100% of the principal
amount of the Notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness, or 100% of the accreted value thereof, if
less (or, in respect of such Pari Passu Indebtedness, such lesser price, if any, as may be provided
for by the terms of such Pari Passu Indebtedness), in each case, plus accrued and unpaid interest
and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the date of purchase, in accordance with the
procedures set forth in the Indenture or the agreements governing such Pari Passu Indebtedness,
as applicable and in minimum denominations of e100,000 and in integral multiples of e1,000 in
excess thereof. The Issuer will deliver notice of such Asset Disposition Offer electronically or by firstclass mail as provided under ‘‘—Selection and Notice’’, with a copy to the Trustee, to each Holder
of Notes at the address of such Holder appearing in the security register, describing the transaction
or transactions that constitute the Asset Disposition and offering to repurchase the Notes for the
specified purchase price on the date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than
30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is delivered, pursuant to the
procedures required by the Indenture, or otherwise in accordance with the procedures of Euroclear
and Clearstream, and described in such notice. The Issuer may satisfy the foregoing obligations
with respect to any Net Available Cash from an Asset Disposition by making an Asset Disposition
Offer with respect to all Net Available Cash prior to the expiration of the relevant 540 days (or such
longer period provided above) or with respect to any unapplied Excess Proceeds.

To the extent that the aggregate amount of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly
tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer is less than the Excess

173


-----

Proceeds, the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary may use any remaining Excess Proceeds for any
purpose not prohibited by the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of the Notes
surrendered in any Asset Disposition Offer by Holders and other Pari Passu Indebtedness
surrendered by holders or lenders, collectively, exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the
Excess Proceeds shall be allocated among the Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness to be
purchased on a pro rata basis on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of tendered Notes
and Pari Passu Indebtedness; provided that no Notes or other Pari Passu Indebtedness in an
unauthorized denomination will remain outstanding after such purchase. Upon completion of any
Asset Disposition Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero (regardless of
whether there are any remaining Excess Proceeds upon such completion).

To the extent that any portion of Net Available Cash payable in respect of the Notes is
denominated in a currency other than Dollars, the amount thereof payable in respect of the Notes
shall not exceed the net amount of funds in Dollars that is actually received by the Issuer upon
converting such portion into Dollars.

Notwithstanding any other provisions of this covenant, (i) to the extent that any or all of the
Net Available Cash of any Asset Disposition by a Foreign Subsidiary (a ‘‘Foreign Disposition’’) is
(x) prohibited or delayed by applicable local law, (y) restricted by applicable organizational
documents or any agreement or (z) subject to other onerous organizational or administrative
impediments from being repatriated, the portion of such Net Available Cash so affected will not be
required to be applied in compliance with this covenant, and such amounts may be retained by the
applicable Foreign Subsidiary so long, but only so long, as the applicable local law, organizational
document, agreement or other impediment will not permit repatriation to the Issuer or a Guarantor,
and once such repatriation of any of such affected Net Available Cash is permitted under the
applicable local law, the applicable organizational document or agreement or the applicable other
impediment, an amount equal to such amount of Net Available Cash so permitted to be repatriated
will be promptly (and in any event not later than 10 Business Days after such repatriation is
permitted) applied (net of any Taxes, costs or expenses that would be payable or reserved against
if such amounts were actually repatriated whether or not they are repatriated) in compliance with
this covenant and (ii) to the extent that the Issuer has determined in good faith that repatriation of
any or all of the Net Available Cash of any Foreign Disposition could have a material adverse tax
consequence with respect to such Net Available Cash (which for the avoidance of doubt, includes,
but is not limited to, any prepayment whereby doing so Holdings, the Issuer, any Restricted
Subsidiary or any of their respective Affiliates and/or equity partners would incur a material tax
liability, including a tax dividend or a withholding tax), the Net Available Cash so affected may be
retained by the applicable Foreign Subsidiary. The non-application of any prepayment amounts as a
consequence of the foregoing provisions will not, for the avoidance of doubt, constitute a Default or
an Event of Default. For the avoidance of doubt, so long as an amount equal to the amount of Net
Available Cash required to be applied in accordance with this covenant is applied by the Issuer,
nothing in the Indenture shall be construed to require any Subsidiary to repatriate cash.

For purposes of clause (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant, the following will be deemed
to be cash:

(1) the (x) assumption or (y) cancellation, extinguishment or termination of Indebtedness or
other liabilities (as reflected on the Issuer’s or such Restricted Subsidiary’s most recent
consolidated balance sheet or in the footnotes thereto, or if incurred or accrued
subsequent to the date of such balance sheet, such liabilities that would have been
reflected on the Issuer’s consolidated balance sheet or in the footnotes thereto if such
incurrence or accrual had taken place on or prior to the date of such balance sheet, as
determined in good faith by the Issuer) contingent or otherwise, in each case of the
Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary (other than Subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuer or

174


-----

a Guarantor) and, in the case of clause (x) only, the release of the Issuer or such
Restricted Subsidiary from all liability on such Indebtedness or other liability in
connection with such Asset Disposition;

(2) securities, notes or other obligations received by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary
from the transferee that are converted by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary into
cash or Cash Equivalents within 180 days following the closing of such Asset Disposition;

(3) Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a
result of such Asset Disposition, to the extent that the Issuer and each other Restricted
Subsidiary are released from any Guarantee of payment of such Indebtedness in
connection with such Asset Disposition;

(4) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Guarantor (other than
Subordinated Indebtedness) received after the Escrow Release Date from Persons who
are not the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; and

(5) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary in such Asset Dispositions having an aggregate fair market value, taken
together with all other Designated Non-Cash Consideration received pursuant to this
covenant that is at that time outstanding, not to exceed the greater of $60.0 million and
15.0% of Consolidated EBITDA for the most recently ended Test Period (calculated on a
Pro Forma Basis) (with the fair market value of each item of Designated Non-Cash
Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving effect to
subsequent changes in value).

The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the
Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws or
regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to this covenant. To
the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the
Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not
be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof.

The provisions under the Indenture relative to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to
repurchase the Notes as a result of an Asset Disposition may be waived or modified with the written
consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding.

The Credit Agreement may prohibit or limit, and future credit agreements or other agreements
to which the Issuer becomes a party may prohibit or limit, the Issuer from purchasing any Notes
pursuant to this covenant. In the event the Issuer is prohibited from purchasing the Notes, the
Issuer could seek the consent of its lenders to the purchase of the Notes or could attempt to
refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If the Issuer does not obtain such consent
or repay such borrowings, it will remain prohibited from purchasing the Notes. In such case, the
Issuer’s failure to purchase tendered Notes would constitute an Event of Default under the
Indenture.

175

**_Limitation on Affiliate Transactions_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to enter into or
conduct any transaction (including the purchase, sale, lease or exchange of any property or the
rendering of any service) with any of the Issuer’s Affiliates (other than Holdings, the Issuer and the
Restricted Subsidiaries or any entity that becomes a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such
transaction) (an ‘‘Affiliate Transaction’’) involving aggregate value in excess of $20.0 million unless:

(1) the terms of such Affiliate Transaction taken as a whole are not materially less favorable
to the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that could be
obtained in a comparable transaction at the time of such transaction or the execution of
the agreement providing for such transaction in arm’s length dealings with a Person who
is not such an Affiliate; and

(2) in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves an aggregate value in excess of
$60.0 million, the terms of such transaction have been approved by a majority of the
members of the Board of Directors of the Issuer or a Parent Entity.

Any Affiliate Transaction shall be deemed to have satisfied the requirements set forth in
clause (2) of this paragraph if such Affiliate Transaction is approved by a majority of the
Disinterested Directors, if any.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not apply to:

(1) any Restricted Payment permitted to be made pursuant to the covenant described under
‘‘—Limitation on Restricted Payments’’ or any Permitted Investment;

(2) any issuance or sale of Capital Stock, options, other equity-related interests or other
securities, or other payments, awards or grants in cash, securities or otherwise pursuant
to, or the funding of, or entering into, or maintenance of, any employment, consulting,
collective bargaining or benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement, related trust or
other similar agreement and other compensation arrangements, options, warrants or
other rights to purchase Capital Stock of the Issuer, any Restricted Subsidiary or any
Parent Entity, restricted stock plans, long-term incentive plans, stock appreciation rights
plans, participation plans or similar employee benefits or consultants’ plans (including
valuation, health, insurance, deferred compensation, severance, retirement, savings or
similar plans, programs or arrangements) or indemnities provided to or on behalf of, or
for the benefit of future, present or former officers, employees, directors or consultants
approved by the Board of Directors of the Issuer, in each case in the ordinary course of
business or consistent with past practice;

(3) any Management Advances and any waiver or transaction with respect thereto;

(4) any transaction between or among the Issuer and any Restricted Subsidiary or between
or among Restricted Subsidiaries (or, in any case, any entity that becomes a Restricted
Subsidiary as a result of such transaction) or any joint venture (regardless of the form of
legal entity) in which the Issuer or any Subsidiary has invested (and which joint venture
would not be an Affiliate of the Issuer but for the Issuer’s or a Subsidiary of the Issuer’s
ownership of Capital Stock in such joint venture) to the extent otherwise permitted under
this ‘‘Certain Covenants’’ section of this ‘‘Description of Notes’’ (other than solely by
reference to this covenant);

(5) the payment of compensation, fees and reimbursement of expenses to, and customary
indemnities (including under customary insurance policies) and employee benefit and
pension expenses provided on behalf of, directors, officers, consultants or employees of

176


-----

the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary (whether directly or indirectly and including
through any Person owned or controlled by any of such directors, officers or employees);

(6) the entry into and performance of obligations of the Issuer or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries under the terms of any transaction arising out of, and any payments
pursuant to or for purposes of funding, any agreement or instrument in effect as of or on
the Issue Date (or any agreement in respect of the Transactions as in effect as of the
Escrow Release Date), as these agreements and instruments may be amended,
modified, supplemented, extended, renewed or refinanced from time to time in
accordance with the other terms of this covenant or to the extent, in the good faith
judgment of the Issuer, not more disadvantageous to the Holders in any material respect
(taken as a whole);

(7) (i) any customary transaction with a Securitization Subsidiary effected as part of a
Qualified Securitization Financing and (ii) any customary transaction with a Receivables
Subsidiary effected as part of a Receivables Facility;

(8) (a) transactions with dealers, customers, clients, suppliers or purchasers or sellers of
goods or services that are Affiliates, in each case in the ordinary course of business or
consistent with past practice, which are fair to the Issuer or the relevant Restricted
Subsidiary in the reasonable determination of the Board of Directors or the senior
management of the Issuer or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary, or are on terms no less
favorable than those that could reasonably have been obtained at such time from an
unaffiliated party or (b) transactions to and from, and transactions with, joint venture
partners or joint ventures (including pursuant to joint venture agreements) or Unrestricted
Subsidiaries entered into the ordinary course (including, without limitation, any cash

Subsidiaries), would have been required to pay in respect of such taxable income as
stand-alone taxpayers or a stand-alone tax group and (B) the amount of such payments

an Unrestricted Subsidiary with an Affiliate prior to the redesignation of any such
Unrestricted Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary; provided that such transaction was
not entered into in contemplation of such designation or redesignation, as applicable.

**_Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries_**

The Issuer may designate any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary if that
designation would not cause an Event of Default. If a Restricted Subsidiary is designated as an
Unrestricted Subsidiary, the aggregate fair market value of all outstanding Investments owned by
the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries in the Subsidiary designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary
will be deemed to be an Investment made as of the time of the designation and will reduce the
amount available for Restricted Payments under the covenant described above under the caption
‘‘—Limitation on Restricted Payments’’ or under one or more clauses of the definition of ‘‘Permitted
Investments’’, as determined by the Issuer. That designation will only be permitted if the Investment
would be permitted at that time and if the Restricted Subsidiary otherwise meets the definition of
‘‘Unrestricted Subsidiary’’. The Issuer may redesignate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a
Restricted Subsidiary if that redesignation would not cause a Default or an Event of Default.

Any designation of a Subsidiary of the Issuer as an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be evidenced
to the Trustee by filing with the Trustee a resolution of the Board of Directors of the Issuer giving
effect to such designation and an Officer’s Certificate certifying that such designation complies with
the preceding conditions and was permitted by the covenant described above under the caption
‘‘—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Restricted Payments’’. If, at any time, any Unrestricted
Subsidiary would fail to meet the preceding requirements as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, it will
thereafter cease to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary for purposes of the Indenture and any
Indebtedness of such Subsidiary will be deemed to be incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary as of
such date and, if such Indebtedness is not permitted to be incurred as of such date under the
covenant described under the caption ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness,
Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock’’, the Issuer will be in default of such covenant.

The Issuer may at any time designate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted
Subsidiary; provided that such designation will be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness by
a Restricted Subsidiary of any outstanding Indebtedness of such Unrestricted Subsidiary, and such
designation will only be permitted if (1) such Indebtedness is permitted under the covenant
described under the caption ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock
and Preferred Stock’’, calculated on a Pro Forma Basis as of the most recently ended Test Period;
and (2) no Default or Event of Default would be in existence following such designation. Any such
designation by the Issuer shall be evidenced to the Trustee by filing with the Trustee a resolution of
the Board of Directors of the Issuer giving effect to such designation and an Officer’s Certificate
certifying that such designation complies with the preceding conditions.

System (or any successor system) (‘‘EDGAR’’), from and after the Issue Date, the Issuer will furnish
to the Trustee and the Holders within 15 days after the time periods specified below:

(1) within 120 days (or 150 days in the case of the fiscal year containing the Issue Date)
after the end of each fiscal year of the Issuer, the consolidated balance sheet of the
Issuer and its Subsidiaries as at the end of such fiscal year, and the related consolidated
statements of operations and cash flows for such fiscal year, setting forth comparative
consolidated and/or combined figures for the preceding fiscal year (to the extent such

in accordance with GAAP, and, in each case, certified by independent certified public
accountants of recognized national standing, together with a customary management
discussion and analysis of the Issuer’s financial condition and results of operations;
_provided, that if at the end of any applicable fiscal year there are any Unrestricted_
Subsidiaries, the Issuer shall also furnish a reasonably detailed presentation, either on
the face of the annual financial statements delivered pursuant to this clause (1) or in the
footnotes thereto, and in the management discussion and analysis, of the financial
condition and results of operations of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries separate
from the financial condition and results of operations of the Unrestricted Subsidiaries of
the Issuer;

(2) within 60 days (or (a) 120 days in the case of the fiscal quarter containing the Issue Date
and the immediately succeeding fiscal quarter to which this clause (2) applies, and
(b) 90 days in the case of the second succeeding fiscal quarter to which this clause (2)
applies following the fiscal quarter containing the Issue Date) after the end of each of the
first three fiscal quarters of each fiscal year, (i) the consolidated balance sheet of the
Issuer and its Subsidiaries as at the end of such quarterly period, (ii) the related
consolidated statements of operations for such quarterly accounting period and for the
elapsed portion of the fiscal year ended with the last day of such quarterly period, and
(iii) the related consolidated statement of cash flows for the elapsed portion of the fiscal
year ended with the last day of such quarterly period, and setting forth comparative
consolidated and/or combined figures for the corresponding periods in the prior fiscal
year (to the extent such comparative presentation is permitted under GAAP) or, in the
case of such consolidated balance sheet, for the last day of the corresponding period in
the prior fiscal year, subject to changes resulting from normal year-end adjustments and
the absence of footnotes, together with a customary management discussion and
analysis of the Issuer’s financial condition and results of operations; provided that such
comparative information need not include consolidated or combined figures for the
second quarter of 2016 or 2017 or the third quarter of 2016; and

(3) promptly (but not later than 10 days following the event) upon the occurrence of any
Change of Control, after a material acquisition, disposition or restructuring of the Issuer
and the Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, upon any bankruptcy or insolvency
involving the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary or any acceleration of material
indebtedness, or upon any change of the entire board of directors, chairman of the
board of directors, chief executive officer or chief financial officer at the Issuer or change
in auditors of the Issuer, a description of such event;

_provided, further, that (a) such information will not be required to comply with Section 302 or_
Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or related Items 307 and 308 of Regulation S-K
promulgated by the SEC, (b) such information will not be required to contain the separate financial
information for Guarantors as contemplated by Rule 3-10 of Regulation S-X, any financial
statements of unconsolidated subsidiaries or 50% or less owned persons as contemplated by
Rule 3-09 of Regulation S-X, any schedules required by Regulation S-X, the financial information

180


-----

required by Rule 3-16 of Regulation S-X, any ‘‘segment reporting’’ or any compensation-related
information (to the extent not required to be reflected on the face of the financial statements
referred to in clauses (1) and (2) of the first paragraph above), including any Compensation
Discussion and Analysis required by Item 402 of Regulation S-K or other information regarding
executive compensation contemplated by SEC Release Nos. 33-8732A, 34-54302A and IC-27444A,
or in each case any successor provisions, (c) such information shall not be required to comply with
Regulation G under the Exchange Act or Item 10(e) of Regulation S-K with respect to any
non-GAAP financial measures contained therein, and (d) such information will not be required to be
provided using eXtensible Business Reporting Language.

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if the Issuer makes an election to change its
fiscal year (which it shall be permitted to do, upon written notice to the Trustee, in which case the
Issuer and the Trustee shall be authorized by the Holders to make any adjustments to the Indenture
and the other Notes Documents as are necessary in order to reflect such change in financial
reporting), the Issuer will be required to furnish to the Trustee and the Holders, within 120 days of
the opening date of its newly elected fiscal year, the consolidated balance sheet of the Issuer and
its Subsidiaries as at the end of such newly elected fiscal year, and the related consolidated
statements of operations for the period from the closing of the Issuer’s most recent fiscal year and
the opening date of its newly elected fiscal year (the ‘‘Transition Period’’), all in reasonable detail
and prepared in accordance with GAAP, and, in each case, certified by independent certified public
accountants of recognized national standing.

To the extent any such information is not so filed or furnished, as applicable, within the time
periods specified above and such information is subsequently filed or furnished, as applicable, the
Issuer will be deemed to have satisfied its obligations with respect thereto at such time and any
Default with respect thereto shall be deemed to have been cured; provided that such cure shall not
otherwise affect the rights of the Holders under ‘‘—Events of Default’’ if Holders of at least 30% in
principal amount of the then total outstanding Notes have declared the principal, premium, if any,
interest, Additional Amounts and any other monetary obligations on all the then outstanding Notes
to be due and payable immediately and such declaration shall not have been rescinded or
cancelled prior to such cure. In addition, to the extent not satisfied by the foregoing, the Issuer will
agree that, for so long as any Notes are outstanding, it will furnish to Holders and to securities
analysts and prospective investors, upon their request, the information required to be delivered
pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act.

The requirement to furnish the information to Holders required by clauses (1), (2) and (3) of
the first paragraph above may be satisfied by the Issuer posting copies of such information on a
website (which may be nonpublic, password protected and may be maintained by the Issuer or a
third party) to which access will be given to Holders, prospective investors in the Notes (which
prospective investors shall be limited to ‘‘qualified institutional buyers’’ within the meaning of
Rule 144A of the Securities Act or non-U.S. persons (as defined in Regulation S under the
Securities Act) that certify their status as to such status to the reasonable satisfaction of the Issuer),
and securities analysts and market making financial institutions that are reasonably satisfactory to
the Issuer; provided, however, that the Issuer may deny access to any competitively-sensitive
information otherwise to be provided pursuant to this covenant to any such Holder, prospective
investor, security analyst or market maker that is a competitor (or an Affiliate of a competitor) of the
Issuer and its Subsidiaries to the extent that the Issuer determines in good faith that the provision of
such information to such Person would be competitively harmful to the Issuer and its Subsidiaries;
and provided, further, that such Holders, prospective investors, security analysts or market makers
will agree to (1) treat all such reports (and the information contained therein) and information as
confidential, (2) not use such reports (and the information contained therein) and information for

181


-----

any purpose other than their investment or potential investment in the Notes and (3) not publicly
disclose or distribute any such reports (and the information contained therein) and information.

The Indenture will permit the Issuer to satisfy its obligations in the preceding paragraphs of
this covenant with respect to financial information relating to the Issuer by furnishing financial
information relating to a Parent Entity (including by making such reports available through EDGAR);
_provided that the same is accompanied by unaudited consolidating information that explains in_
reasonable detail the differences (if any) between the information relating to such Parent Entity, on
the one hand, and the information relating to the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries on a
standalone basis, on the other hand.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth above, if the Issuer or any Parent Entity has
made available through EDGAR the reports described in the preceding paragraphs with respect to
the Issuer or any Parent Entity (including any consolidated financial information required by
Regulation S-X relating to the Issuer), the Issuer shall be deemed to be in compliance with the
provisions of this covenant.

The Issuer will also hold quarterly conference calls for the Holders of the Notes to discuss
financial information for the previous quarter, if such conference calls are held with the lenders
under any Credit Facility (if applicable) or with any equity investors of the Issuer or any Parent
Entity and analysts; it being understood that such quarterly conference call may be the same
conference call as with such lenders or equity investors and analysts. Prior to any such conference
call, the Issuer will issue a press release or other notification announcing the time and date of such
conference call and providing instructions to Holders, securities analysts and applicable current and
prospective investors on how to obtain access to such call.

The Trustee will have no responsibility whatsoever to determine whether any posting or filing
through EDGAR or on any website as described herein has occurred. The Trustee shall not be
deemed to have constructive notice of any information contained, or determinable from information
contained, in any reports referred to above, including the Issuer’s compliance with any of the
covenants of the Indenture.

**_Limitation on Guarantees_**

The Issuer will not permit any of its Wholly-Owned Subsidiaries that are Restricted Subsidiaries
(and non-Wholly-Owned Subsidiaries if such non-Wholly-Owned Subsidiaries Guarantee other
capital markets debt securities of the Issuer or any Guarantor or Guarantee Indebtedness of the
Issuer under the Credit Agreement), other than a Guarantor, to Guarantee the payment of any
capital markets debt securities of the Issuer or any Guarantor or Indebtedness of the Issuer under
the Credit Agreement, in each case, unless:

(1) such Restricted Subsidiary within 60 days executes and delivers a supplemental
indenture to the Indenture providing for a Note Guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary,
except that with respect to a Guarantee of Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor, if
such Indebtedness is by its express terms subordinated in right of payment to the Notes
or such Guarantor’s Note Guarantee, any such Guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary
with respect to such Indebtedness shall be subordinated in right of payment to such
Note Guarantee of such Restricted Subsidiary substantially to the same extent as such
Indebtedness is subordinated to the Notes or such Guarantor’s Note Guarantee; and

(2) such Restricted Subsidiary waives and will not in any manner whatsoever claim or take
the benefit or advantage of, any rights of reimbursement, indemnity or subrogation or
any other rights against the Issuer or any other Restricted Subsidiary as a result of any

182


-----

payment by such Restricted Subsidiary under its Guarantee until payment in full of all
Obligations under the Indenture;

_provided that this covenant shall not be applicable (i) to any Guarantee of any Restricted Subsidiary_
that existed at the time such Person became a Restricted Subsidiary and was not incurred in
connection with, or in contemplation of, such Person becoming a Restricted Subsidiary, (ii) in the
event that the Guarantee of the Issuer’s obligations under the Notes or the Indenture by such
Restricted Subsidiary would not be permitted under applicable law or (iii) to any Guarantee of
capital markets debt securities, where such Restricted Subsidiary, in accordance with the Agreed
Security Principles, does not provide a Guarantee of any Indebtedness of the Issuer under the
Credit Agreement. At the option of the Issuer, any Note Guarantee may contain limitations on
Guarantor liability to the extent reasonably necessary to recognize certain defenses generally
available to guarantors (including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable
preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations
or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other considerations under applicable law.
For the avoidance of doubt the Issuer’s Restricted Subsidiaries organized in Italy shall not be
obligated to Guarantee the Notes, but are expected to Guarantee certain of the Indebtedness under
the Credit Agreement.

The Agreed Security Principles apply to the granting of Guarantees in favor of obligations
under the Credit Agreement. The Agreed Security Principles include restrictions on the granting of
Guarantees where, among other things, such grant would be restricted by general statutory or other
legal limitations or requirements, financial assistance rules, corporate benefit rules, fraudulent
preference rules, ‘‘thin capitalization’’ rules, capital maintenance rules, retention of title claims and
similar matters, or where the time and cost of granting the Guarantee would be disproportionate to
the benefit accruing to the Holders of the Notes.

The Issuer may elect, in its sole discretion, to cause any Subsidiary that is not otherwise
required to be a Subsidiary Guarantor to become a Subsidiary Guarantor, in which case, such
Subsidiary shall not be required to comply with the 60-day period described in clause (1) above.

**_Maintenance of Listing_**

The Issuer will (i) use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Notes to be listed on
the Official List of the Exchange and for permission to deal in the Notes on the Exchange as
promptly as practicable after the Issue Date, and (ii) use its commercially reasonable efforts to
maintain such listing and permission to deal for as long as any of the Notes are outstanding. If the
Notes fail to be, or at any time cease to be, listed on the Official List of, and for there to be
permission to deal in the Notes on, the Exchange, the Issuer will use its commercially reasonable
efforts to list the Notes on another ‘‘recognized stock exchange’’ (within the meaning of Section
1005 of the UK Income Tax Act 2007) in western Europe as promptly as practicable after the date
on which the Notes are not so listed or such dealing is no longer permitted.

**_Merger and Consolidation_**

_The Issuer_

The Issuer will not consolidate with or merge with or into, or convey, transfer or lease all or
substantially all its assets to, any Person, unless:

(1) the Issuer is the resulting or surviving Person or the resulting, surviving or transferee
Person (such resulting or surviving Person, including, if applicable, the Issuer, or such
transferred Person, as applicable, the ‘‘Successor Company’’) will be a European
Company (Societas Europaea) or a Person organized and existing under the laws of the

183


-----

United States, any State of the United States or the District of Columbia, or any territory
thereof, the United Kingdom or any member state of the European Union, and the
Successor Company (if not the Issuer) will expressly assume, by supplemental indenture,
executed and delivered to the Trustee, all the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes
and the Indenture and if such Successor Company is not a corporation, a co-obligor of
the Notes is a corporation organized or existing under such laws;

(2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness that
becomes an obligation of the applicable Successor Company or any Restricted
Subsidiary of the applicable Successor Company as a result of such transaction as
having been Incurred by the applicable Successor Company or any such Restricted
Subsidiary at the time of such transaction), no Default or Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing;

(3) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, on a Pro Forma Basis, either (a) the
Successor Company or the Issuer (as applicable) would be able to Incur at least an
additional $1.00 of Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph of the covenant
described under ‘‘—Limitation on Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock’’
or (b) the Consolidated Coverage Ratio for the Issuer or the Successor Company (as
applicable) as of the most recently ended Test Period would not be lower than it was for
such Test Period immediately prior to giving effect to such transaction; and

(4) the Issuer (or Successor Company if other than the Issuer) shall have delivered to the
Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that such
consolidation, merger or transfer, and such supplemental indenture (if any), comply with
the Indenture; provided that in giving an Opinion of Counsel, counsel may rely on an
Officer’s Certificate as to compliance with the foregoing clauses (2) and (3) and as to any
matters of fact, including as to satisfaction of the conditions in this covenant.

The Successor Company will succeed to, and (if other than the Issuer) be substituted for, and
may exercise every right and power of, the Issuer under the Notes and the Indenture, and in such
event where the Successor Company is not the Issuer, the Issuer will automatically be released
from its obligations under the Notes and the Indenture, but in the case of a lease of all or
substantially all its assets, the predecessor company will not be released from its obligations under
the Notes or the Indenture.

Notwithstanding the preceding clauses (2), (3) and (4) (which do not apply to transactions
referred to in this sentence), (a) any Restricted Subsidiary may consolidate with or merge with or
into, or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all its assets to, the Issuer, (b) the Issuer and
the Restricted Subsidiaries may effect any Permitted Reorganization, (c) the Issuer and the
Restricted Subsidiaries may consummate the Transactions and (d) the Issuer and the Restricted
Subsidiaries may consummate a consolidation or merger or conveyance, transfer or lease, the
purpose of which is to effect an Investment permitted pursuant to the covenant described under
‘‘—Limitation on Restricted Payments’’, including an Investment that constitutes a Permitted
Investment.

Notwithstanding the preceding clauses (2) and (3) (which do not apply to the transactions
referred to in this sentence), (a) the Issuer may consolidate or otherwise combine with or merge
with or into an Affiliate incorporated or organized for the purpose of changing the legal domicile of
the Issuer, reincorporating the Issuer in another jurisdiction, or changing the legal form of the Issuer
and (b) the Issuer may effect any Permitted Reorganization.

184


-----

There is no precise established definition of the phrase ‘‘substantially all’’ under applicable
law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a
particular transaction would involve ‘‘all or substantially all’’ of the property or assets of a Person.

For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing provisions shall not apply to the creation of a new
Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer or to the Transactions.

_Subsidiary Guarantors_

Subject to certain limitations described in the Indenture governing release of a Note Guarantee
as described under the caption ‘‘—Guarantees’’ above, no Subsidiary Guarantor may:

(1) consolidate with or merge with or into any Person, or

(2) convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all its assets to any Person, in one
transaction or a series of related transactions,

unless

(A) the other Person is the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Subsidiary
Guarantor or becomes a Subsidiary Guarantor concurrently with the transaction;

(B) either (x) such Subsidiary Guarantor is the resulting or surviving Person or (y)(I) the
resulting, surviving or transferee Person (the ‘‘Successor Person’’) will be a
European Company (Societas Europaea) or a Person organized and existing under
the laws of the United States, any State of the United States or the District of
Columbia, or any territory thereof, the United Kingdom or any member state of the
European Union, and the Successor Person (if not a Subsidiary Guarantor or the
Issuer) will expressly assume, by supplemental indenture, executed and delivered to
the Trustee, all the obligations of such Subsidiary Guarantor under the Indenture
and such Subsidiary Guarantor’s related Note Guarantee and (II) immediately after
giving effect to the transaction, on a Pro Forma Basis, no Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing;

(C) the transaction constitutes a sale, lease or other disposition (including by way of
consolidation, amalgamation or merger) of the Subsidiary Guarantor or the sale or
disposition of all or substantially all the assets of the Subsidiary Guarantor (in each
case other than to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary) otherwise permitted by the
Indenture; or

(D) the transaction constitutes a Permitted Reorganization.

Notwithstanding the foregoing (which do not apply to transactions referred to in this
sentence), (a) any Subsidiary Guarantor may consolidate with or merge with or into, or convey,
transfer or lease all or substantially all its assets to, the Issuer or another Guarantor or, subject to
compliance with clause (B)(x) or (B)(y)(I) above, any Non-Guarantor, (b) the Issuer and the
Restricted Subsidiaries may consummate the Transactions, (c) any Subsidiary Guarantor may
liquidate, dissolve or wind up if the Issuer determines in good faith that such liquidation, dissolution
or winding up is in the best interests of the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, and is not materially disadvantageous to the Holders, (d) any Guarantor may consummate a
consolidation or merger or conveyance, transfer or lease, the purpose of which is to effect an
Investment permitted pursuant to the covenant described under ‘‘—Limitation on Restricted
Payments’’, including an Investment that constitutes a Permitted Investment, and (e) subject to
compliance with clause (B)(x) or (B)(y)(I) of the immediately preceding paragraph, any Guarantor
may change its legal domicile or reincorporate in another jurisdiction or change its legal form.

185


-----

Any Restricted Subsidiary may consolidate with or merge with or into, or convey, transfer or
lease all or substantially all its assets to any other Restricted Subsidiary.

**Events of Default**

The Indenture will provide that each of the following is an Event of Default under the
Indenture:

(1) default in any payment of interest on any Note when due and payable, continued for
30 days;

(2) default in the payment of the principal amount of, or premium, if any, on any Note issued
under the Indenture when due at its Stated Maturity, upon optional redemption, upon
required repurchase, upon declaration of acceleration or otherwise;

(3) failure by the Issuer or any Guarantor to comply for 60 days after written notice by the
Trustee on behalf of the Holders or by the Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of
the outstanding Notes with any agreement or obligation (other than a default referred to
in clause (1) or (2) above) contained in the Indenture; provided that in the case of a
failure to comply with the Indenture provisions described under ‘‘Reports’’, such period of
continuance of such default or breach shall be 90 days after written notice described in
this clause (3) has been given;

(4) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or
by which there may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by
the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (or the payment of which is Guaranteed
by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries) other than Indebtedness owed to the
Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary whether such Indebtedness or Guarantee now exists, or
is created after the date hereof, which default:

(a) is caused by a failure to pay principal of such Indebtedness, at its stated final
maturity (after giving effect to any applicable grace periods) provided in such
Indebtedness (‘‘payment default’’); or

(b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its stated final maturity (the
‘‘cross acceleration provision’’);

and, in each case, the principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the
principal amount of any other such Indebtedness under which there has been a payment
default or the maturity of which has been so accelerated, aggregates $100.0 million or
more;

(5) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or court protection of the Issuer or any
Significant Subsidiary (the ‘‘bankruptcy provisions’’);

(6) failure by the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary to pay final judgments aggregating in
excess of $100.0 million other than any judgments covered by indemnities provided by,
or insurance policies issued by, reputable and creditworthy companies, which final
judgments remain unpaid, undischarged and unstayed for a period of more than 60
consecutive days after such judgment becomes final, and in the event such judgment is
covered by insurance, an enforcement proceeding has been commenced by any creditor
upon such judgment or decree which is not promptly stayed (the ‘‘judgment default
_provision’’); or_

(7) any Note Guarantee by a Significant Subsidiary ceases to be in full force and effect,
other than in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, or a Subsidiary Guarantor that

186


-----

is a Significant Subsidiary denies or disaffirms its obligations under its Note Guarantee,
other than in accordance with the terms thereof or upon release of such Note Guarantee
in accordance with the Indenture.

However, a Default under clauses (3), (4) or (6) of this paragraph will not constitute an Event
of Default until the Trustee or the Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding
Notes notify the Issuer of the Default and, with respect to clauses (3) and (6), the Issuer does not
cure such Default within the time specified in clauses (3) or (6), as applicable, of this paragraph
after receipt of such notice.

If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in clause (5) above with
respect to the Issuer) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee by written notice to the Issuer or the
Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes by written notice to
the Issuer and the Trustee, may declare the principal of, and premium, if any, and accrued and
unpaid interest and Additional Amounts on, all the Notes to be due and payable. Upon such a
declaration, such principal, premium and accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts will
be due and payable immediately. In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Notes because
an Event of Default described in clause (4) under ‘‘Events of Default’’ has occurred and is
continuing, the declaration of acceleration of the Notes shall be automatically annulled if the event
of default or payment default triggering such Event of Default pursuant to clause (4) shall be
remedied or cured, or waived by the holders of the applicable Indebtedness, or the Indebtedness
that gave rise to such Event of Default shall have been discharged in full, in each case, within
30 days after the declaration of acceleration with respect thereto and if (1) the annulment of the
acceleration of the Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent
jurisdiction and (2) all existing Events of Default, except nonpayment of principal of, and premium
or interest, if any, on, the Notes that became due solely because of the acceleration of the Notes,
have been cured or waived.

If an Event of Default described in clause (5) above with respect to the Issuer occurs and is
continuing, the principal of, and premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest and Additional
Amounts on, all the Notes will become and be immediately due and payable without any
declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders.

The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes under
the Indenture may waive all past or existing Defaults or Events of Default (except a continuing
Default with respect to nonpayment of principal, premium, interest or Additional Amounts) and
rescind any such acceleration with respect to such Notes and its consequences if rescission would
not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction.

The Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a
required certificate in connection with another default (the ‘‘Initial Default’’) occurs, then at the time
such Initial Default is cured, such Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required
certificate in connection with another default that resulted solely because of that Initial Default will
also be cured without any further action and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to
comply with the time periods prescribed in the covenant entitled ‘‘Reports’’ or otherwise to deliver
any notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of the Indenture shall be deemed to be
cured upon the delivery of any such report required by such covenant or such notice or certificate,
as applicable, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the
Indenture.

The Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the
Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered (and, if
requested, provided) to the Trustee indemnity or security satisfactory to the Trustee against any
loss, liability or expense that may be incurred. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of

187


-----

principal, premium or interest when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the
Indenture or the Notes unless:

(1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is
continuing;

(2) Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes have
requested in writing the Trustee to pursue the remedy;

(3) such Holders have offered in writing to the Trustee security or indemnity satisfactory to
the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense;

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the
written request and the offer of security or indemnity; and

(5) the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes have
not given the Trustee a written direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent
with such request within such 60-day period.

Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the
outstanding Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any
proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on
the Trustee. The Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing, the Trustee will be required in the exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that
a prudent person would use in the conduct of such person’s own affairs. The Trustee, however,
may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee
determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee
in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to
indemnification satisfactory to it against all losses, liabilities and expenses that may be caused by
taking or not taking such action.

The Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and the Trustee is
informed of such occurrence by the Issuer, the Trustee shall give notice of the Default to the
Holders within 60 days after being notified by the Issuer. Except in the case of a Default in the
payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on, any Note, the Trustee may withhold
notice if and so long as the Trustee in good faith determines that withholding notice is in the
interests of the Holders. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the
end of each fiscal year, an Officer’s Certificate indicating whether the signer thereof knows of any
Default that has occurred and is continuing. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee written
notice of any events of which it is aware, within 30 days after the Issuer becoming aware thereof,
which would constitute certain Defaults, their status and what action the Issuer is taking or
proposes to take in respect thereof.

**Amendments and Waivers**

Subject to certain exceptions, the Notes Documents may be amended, supplemented or
otherwise modified with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal
amount of the Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase
of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, such Notes) and, subject to certain exceptions, any existing
Default or Event of Default or compliance by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary with any
provisions thereof may be waived with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate
principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a
purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, such Notes). However, the Indenture will provide
that, without the consent of Holders holding not less than 90% of the aggregate principal amount of

188


-----

the Notes then outstanding, an amendment or waiver may not, with respect to any Notes held by a
non-consenting Holder:

(1) reduce the principal amount of such Notes whose Holders must consent to an
amendment, supplement or waiver;

(2) reduce the stated rate of, or extend the stated time for payment of, interest on any such
Note;

(3) reduce the principal of or extend the Stated Maturity of any such Note;

(4) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any such Note or change the time
at which any such Note may be redeemed (for the avoidance of doubt, other than
provisions relating to a Change of Control and Asset Dispositions); provided, any
amendment to the minimum notice requirement may be made with the consent of the
Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of then outstanding Notes;

(5) make any such Note payable in currency other than that stated in such Note;

(6) impair the right of any Holder to institute suit for the enforcement of any right to receive
payment of principal of and interest or Additional Amounts on such Holder’s Notes;

(7) waive a Default or Event of Default with respect to the nonpayment of principal, premium
or interest (except pursuant to a rescission of acceleration of the Notes by the Holders of
at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of such Notes and a waiver of the
payment default that resulted from such acceleration);

(8) make any change to or modify the ranking of the Notes or Note Guarantees that would
adversely affect the Holders; or

(9) make any change in the amendment or waiver provisions which require the Holders’
consent described in this sentence.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any Holder, the Issuer, the Trustee, the
Guarantors (with respect to any Notes Document to which it is a party) and any other agents party
thereto, as applicable, may amend or supplement, or waive any provision of, any Notes Document
to:

(1) cure any ambiguity, omission, mistake, defect, error or inconsistency, conform any
provision to this ‘‘Description of Notes’’, to the extent such provision was intended to be
a verbatim recitation thereof, as such intention is set forth in an Officer’s Certificate, or
reduce the minimum denomination of the Notes;

(2) provide for the assumption by a successor Person of the obligations of the Issuer or any
Guarantor under any Notes Document;

(3) provide for uncertificated Notes in addition to or in place of certificated Notes;

(4) add to the covenants or provide for a Note Guarantee for the benefit of the Holders or
surrender any right or power conferred upon the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(5) make any change that does not adversely affect the rights of any Holder in any material
respect (as determined in good faith by the Issuer);

(6) at the Issuer’s election, comply with any requirement of the SEC in connection with the
qualification of the Indenture under the Trust Indenture Act (it being agreed that the
Indenture will not on the Issue Date, and need not thereafter, qualify under the Trust
Indenture Act);

189


-----

(7) make such provisions as necessary (as determined in good faith by the Issuer) for the
issuance of Additional Notes and to secure such Additional Notes and all related
Obligations;

(8) provide for any Restricted Subsidiary to provide a Note Guarantee in accordance with the
covenant described under ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness,
Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock’’, to add Guarantees with respect to the Notes, to
add security to or for the benefit of the Notes, or to confirm and evidence the release,
termination, discharge or retaking of any Guarantee or Lien with respect to or securing
the Notes when such release, termination, discharge or retaking is provided for under the
Indenture;

(9) evidence and provide for the acceptance and appointment under the Indenture of a
successor Trustee pursuant to the requirements thereof or to provide for the accession
by the Trustee to any Notes Document;

(10) make any amendment to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the transfer and
legending of Notes as permitted by the Indenture, including to facilitate the issuance and
administration of Notes; provided, however, that (i) compliance with the Indenture as so
amended would not result in Notes being transferred in violation of the Securities Act or
any applicable securities law and (ii) such amendment does not adversely affect the
rights of Holders to transfer Notes in any material respect;

(11) provide for the release, addition, completion, confirmation or grant of Note Guarantees
permitted or required by the Indenture, including the entering into or execution of
supplemental indentures and/or Note Guarantees; or

(12) change its fiscal year, upon written notice to the Trustee and delivery of the financial
statements with respect to the Transition Period in accordance with the covenant
described under ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Reports’’, in which case the Issuer and the
Trustee shall be authorized by the Holders to make any adjustments to the Indenture and
the other Notes Documents as are necessary in order to reflect such change in financial
reporting.

The consent of the Holders is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular
form of any proposed amendment of any Notes Document. It is sufficient if such consent approves
the substance of the proposed amendment. A consent to any amendment or waiver under the
Indenture by any Holder of Notes given in connection with a tender of such Holder’s Notes will not
be rendered invalid by such tender.

**Defeasance**

The Issuer at any time may terminate all obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under
the Notes, the Note Guarantees and the Indenture (‘‘legal defeasance’’) and cure all then existing
Defaults and Events of Default, except for certain obligations, including those respecting the
defeasance trust, the rights, powers, trusts, duties, immunities and indemnities of the Trustee and
the obligations of the Issuer in connection therewith and obligations concerning issuing temporary
Notes, registrations of Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes and the maintenance of an
office or agency for payment and money for security payments held in trust.

The Issuer at any time may terminate the obligations of the Issuer and the Restricted
Subsidiaries under the covenants described under ‘‘—Certain Covenants’’ (other than clauses (1)
and (2) of the first paragraph under ‘‘—Merger and Consolidation’’) and ‘‘—Change of Control’’ and
the default provisions relating to such covenants described under ‘‘—Events of Default’’ above, the
operation of the cross-default upon a payment default, the cross acceleration provisions, the

190


-----

bankruptcy provisions with respect to the Issuer and Significant Subsidiaries, the judgment default
provision and the guarantee provision described under ‘‘—Events of Default’’ above (‘‘covenant
_defeasance’’)._

The Issuer at its option at any time may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding
its prior exercise of its covenant defeasance option. If the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance
option, payment of the Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default with respect
to the Notes. If the Issuer exercises its covenant defeasance option with respect to the Notes,
payment of the Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default specified in
clause (3), (4), (5) (with respect only to Significant Subsidiaries), (6) or (7) under ‘‘—Events of
Default’’ above.

In order to exercise either defeasance option, the Issuer (x) must irrevocably deposit with the
Trustee or Paying Agent (or other such entity directed, designated or appointed by the Issuer and
reasonably acceptable to the Trustee acting for the Trustee for such purpose) cash in Dollars (if to
the Trustee) or cash in Euros or European Government Obligations (if to the Paying Agent), or a
combination thereof, for the payment of principal of, and premium, if any, and interest on, the Notes
to, but excluding, the date of redemption or maturity, as the case may be; provided, upon any
redemption that requires the payment of the Applicable Premium, the amount deposited will be
sufficient for purposes of the Indenture to the extent that an amount is deposited with the Trustee or
Paying Agent (or other such entity directed, designated or appointed by the Issuer and reasonably
acceptable to the Trustee acting for the Trustee for such purpose) equal to the Applicable Premium
calculated as of the date of the notice of redemption, with any deficit as of the date of redemption
(any such amount, the ‘‘Applicable Premium Deficit’’) only required to be deposited with the Trustee
or Paying Agent (or other such entity directed, designated or appointed by the Issuer and
reasonably acceptable to the Trustee acting for the Trustee for such purpose) on or prior to the
date of redemption. Any Applicable Premium Deficit will be set forth in an Officer’s Certificate
delivered to the Trustee simultaneously with the deposit of such Applicable Premium Deficit that
confirms that such Applicable Premium Deficit will be applied toward such redemption; and
(y) must comply with certain other conditions, including delivery to the Trustee of:

(1) an Opinion of Counsel in the United States, subject to customary assumptions and
exclusions, confirming that (a) in the case of legal defeasance, (i) the Issuer has received
from, or there has been published by, the United States Internal Revenue Service a
ruling, or (ii) since the issuance of the Notes, there has been a change in the applicable
U.S. federal income tax law, in either case of the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), that based
thereon the Holders will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, as applicable, as a result of such legal defeasance and will be subject to U.S.
federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as
would have been the case if such legal defeasance had not occurred and (b) in the case
of covenant defeasance, the Holders will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S.
federal income tax purposes as a result of such covenant defeasance and will be subject
to such tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would
have been the case if such covenant defeasance had not occurred;

(2) an Opinion of Counsel stating that, as of the date of such opinion and subject to
customary assumptions and exclusions, following the deposit, the trust funds will not be
subject to the effect of Section 547 of the United States Bankruptcy Code, as amended;

(3) an Officer’s Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Issuer with the intent
of defeating, hindering, delaying, defrauding or preferring any creditors of the Issuer;

(4) an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (which Opinion of Counsel may be
subject to customary assumptions and exclusions), each stating that all conditions

191


-----

precedent provided for or relating to legal defeasance or covenant defeasance, as the
case may be, have been complied with; and

(5) with respect to European Government Obligations or a combination of money and
European Government Obligations, a certificate from an Independent Financial Advisor
expressing their opinion that the payments of principal and interest when due and
without reinvestment on the deposited European Government Obligations plus any
deposited money without investment will provide cash at such times and in such
amounts as will be sufficient to pay principal, premium (if any) and interest on the Notes
to redemption or maturity, as the case may be.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Indenture will provide that it will be discharged and cease to be of further effect (except
as expressly provided for in the Indenture) as to all outstanding Notes when either (a) all the Notes
previously authenticated and delivered (other than certain lost, stolen or destroyed Notes and
certain Notes for which provision for payment was previously made and thereafter the funds have
been released to the Holders) have been delivered to the Registrar for cancellation; or (b)(i) all
Notes not previously delivered to the Registrar for cancellation (x) have become due and payable,
(y) will become due and payable at their Stated Maturity within one year or (z) are to be called for
redemption within one year under arrangements satisfactory to the Paying Agent for the giving of
notice of redemption by the Paying Agent in the name, and at the expense, of the Issuer; (ii) the
Issuer has deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee or Paying Agent (or other such
entity directed, designated or appointed by the Issuer and reasonably acceptable to the Trustee
acting for the Trustee for such purpose), cash in Dollars (if to the Trustee) or cash in Euros or
European Government Obligations (if to the Paying Agent), or a combination thereof (together with,
if European Government Obligations or a combination of money and European Government
Obligations are deposited, a certificate from an Independent Financial Advisor to the effect set forth
in clause (5) under ‘‘—Defeasance’’), as applicable, in the case of Notes, in an amount sufficient to
pay and discharge the entire Indebtedness on the Notes not previously delivered to the Registrar
for cancellation, for principal, premium, if any, and interest to, but excluding, the date of deposit (in
the case of Notes that have become due and payable), or to, but excluding, the Stated Maturity or
redemption date, as the case may be; provided, that (I) upon any redemption that requires the
payment of the Applicable Premium, the amount deposited will be sufficient for purposes of the
Indenture to the extent that an amount is deposited with the Paying Agent equal to the Applicable
Premium calculated as of the date of the notice of redemption, with any Applicable Premium Deficit
only required to be deposited with the Trustee or Paying Agent (or other such entity directed,
designated or appointed by the Issuer and reasonably acceptable to the Trustee acting for the
Trustee for such purpose) on or prior to the date of redemption and (II) any Applicable Premium
Deficit will be set forth in an Officer’s Certificate delivered to the Trustee simultaneously with the
deposit of such Applicable Premium Deficit that confirms that such Applicable Premium Deficit will
be applied toward such redemption; (iii) the Issuer has paid or caused to be paid all other sums
payable under the Indenture; and (iv) the Issuer has delivered to the Paying Agent and the Trustee
an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel each stating that all conditions precedent under
the ‘‘—Satisfaction and Discharge’’ section of the Indenture relating to the satisfaction and
discharge of the Indenture have been complied with; provided that any such counsel may rely on
any Officer’s Certificate as to matters of fact (including as to compliance with the foregoing
clauses (b)(i), (b)(ii) and (b)(iii)).

192

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Shareholders**

No director, officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner or equityholder of the Issuer or
any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, as such, shall have any personal liability for any obligations of
the Issuer under the Notes Documents or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of,
such obligations or their creation. Each Holder by accepting a Note waives and releases all such
liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Notes. Such waiver
may not be effective to waive liabilities under the U.S. federal securities laws and it is the view of
the SEC that such a waiver is against public policy.

**Concerning the Trustee, Paying Agent, Registrar and Transfer Agent**

Wilmington Trust, National Association will be appointed as Trustee and Citibank, N.A., London
Branch will be appointed as Paying Agent, Registrar and Transfer Agent under the Indenture. The
Indenture will provide that, except during the continuance of an Event of Default, the Trustee will
perform only such duties as are set forth specifically in the Indenture. During the existence of an
Event of Default, the Trustee will exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it under the
Indenture and use the same degree of care that a prudent Person would use in conducting such
person’s own affairs. The permissive rights of the Trustee to take or refrain from taking any action
enumerated in the Indenture will not be construed as an obligation or duty.

The Indenture will impose certain limitations on the rights of the Trustee, should it become a
creditor of the Issuer, to obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to realize on certain property
received in respect of any such claim as security or otherwise. The Trustee will be permitted to
engage in other transactions with the Issuer and its Affiliates and Subsidiaries.

The Indenture will set out the terms under which the Trustee may retire or be removed, and
replaced. Such terms will include, among others, (1) that the Trustee may be removed at any time
by the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes, or may
resign at any time by giving written notice to the Issuer and (2) that if the Trustee at any time
(a) has or acquires a conflict of interest that is not eliminated, (b) fails to meet certain minimum
limits regarding the aggregate of its capital and surplus or (c) becomes incapable of acting as
Trustee or becomes insolvent or bankrupt, then the Issuer may remove the Trustee, or any Holder
who has been a bona fide Holder for not less than six months may petition any court for removal of
the Trustee and appointment of a successor Trustee.

Any removal or resignation of the Trustee shall not become effective until the acceptance of
appointment by the successor Trustee.

The Indenture will contain provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee, the Paying Agent,
the Registrar and the Transfer Agent for any loss, liability, taxes, fees and expenses incurred without
gross negligence or willful misconduct on its part, arising out of or in connection with the
acceptance or administration of the Indenture.

**Notices**

If and for so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange and if and to the
extent that the rules of the Exchange so require, notices of the Issuer with respect to the Notes will
be sent to the Exchange.

All notices to Holders of Notes will be validly given if electronically delivered or mailed to them
at their respective addresses in the register of the Holders, if any, maintained by the Registrar. For
so long as any Notes are represented by global notes, all notices to Holders will be delivered to
Euroclear and Clearstream in accordance with the applicable procedures of Euroclear and
Clearstream, delivery of which shall be deemed to satisfy the requirements of this paragraph, which

193


-----

will give such notices to the Holders of book-entry interests in the global notes evidencing the
Notes.

Each such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the date of such publication or, if
published more than once on different dates, on the first date on which publication is made;
_provided that, if notices are mailed, such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the later of_
such publication and the seventh day after being so mailed. Any notice or communication mailed to
a Holder shall be mailed to such Person by first-class mail or other equivalent means and shall be
sufficiently given to such Holder if so mailed within the time prescribed. Failure to mail a notice or
communication to a Holder or any defect in it shall not affect its sufficiency with respect to other
Holders. If a notice or communication is mailed in the manner provided above, it is duly given,
whether or not the addressee receives it. If a notice or communication is given via Euroclear or
Clearstream, it is duly given on the day the notice is given to Euroclear or Clearstream.

**Currency Indemnity and Calculation of Euro-Denominated Restrictions**

Euro is the sole currency of account and payment for all sums payable by the Issuer and the
Guarantors, if any, under or in connection with the Notes and the Note Guarantees, if any, including
damages. Any amount received or recovered in a currency other than Euro, whether as a result of,
or the enforcement of, a judgment or order of a court of any jurisdiction, in the winding-up or
dissolution of the Issuer, any Guarantor or otherwise by any Holder or by the Trustee, in respect of
any sum expressed to be due to it from the Issuer or a Guarantor will only constitute a discharge of
the Issuer or such Guarantor, as applicable, to the extent of the Euro amount which the recipient is
able to purchase with the amount so received or recovered in that other currency on the date of
that receipt or recovery (or, if it is not practicable to make that purchase on that date, on the first
date on which it is practicable to do so).

If that Euro amount is less than the Euro amount expressed to be due to the recipient or the
Trustee under any Note, the Issuer and the Guarantors will indemnify such recipient and the Trustee
against any loss sustained by such recipient or the Trustee as a result. In any event, the Issuer and
the Guarantors will indemnify the recipient or the Trustee on a joint and several basis against the
cost of making any such purchase. For the purposes of this currency indemnity provision, it will be
prima facie evidence of the matter stated therein for the Holder of a Note or the Trustee to certify in
a manner reasonably satisfactory to the Issuer (indicating the sources of information used) the loss
it Incurred in making any such purchase. These indemnities constitute a separate and independent
obligation from the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ other obligations, will give rise to a separate and
independent cause of action, will apply irrespective of any waiver granted by any Holder of a Note
or the Trustee (other than a waiver of the indemnities set out herein) and will continue in full force
and effect despite any other judgment, order, claim or proof for a liquidated amount in respect of
any sum due under any Note or any Note Guarantee, or to the Trustee.

Except as otherwise specifically set forth herein, for purposes of determining compliance with
any Euro-denominated restriction herein, the Euro Equivalent amount for purposes hereof that is
denominated in a non-Euro currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange
rate in effect on the date such non-Euro amount is Incurred or made, as the case may be.

**Consent to Jurisdiction and Service of Process**

The Indenture will provide that the Issuer and each Guarantor will appoint Maples Fiduciary
Services (Delaware) Inc. as its agent for service of process in any suit, action or proceeding with
respect to the Indenture, the Notes and the Note Guarantees brought in any federal or state court
located in the City of New York and will submit to such jurisdiction.

194


-----

**Prescription**

Claims against the Issuer or any Guarantor for the payment of principal of, or interest,
premium, or Additional Amounts, if any, on the Notes will become void unless presentation for
payment is made as required in the Indenture within a period of seven years, in the case of
principal, or five years, in the case of interest, premium or Additional Amounts, if any, from the
applicable original payment date therefor; provided that such claim has not been stayed or
otherwise prohibited or delayed by applicable law or court order.

**Governing Law**

The Indenture and the Notes, including any Note Guarantees, and the rights and duties of the
parties thereunder, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of
New York.

**Limited Condition Transactions**

In connection with any action being taken in connection with a Limited Condition Transaction,
for purposes of any provision of the Indenture which will require that no Default, Event of Default or
specified Event of Default, as applicable, has occurred, is continuing or would result from any such
action, as applicable, such condition shall, at the option of the Issuer, be deemed satisfied, so long
as no Default, Event of Default or specified Event of Default, as applicable, exists on the date the
definitive agreement for such Limited Condition Transaction is entered into.

Furthermore, in connection with any action being taken in connection with a Limited Condition
Transaction, for purposes of:

(1) determining compliance with any provision of the Indenture which will require the
calculation of any financial ratio or test, including the Consolidated Coverage Ratio, the
Consolidated Secured Net Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio;
or

(2) testing availability under baskets to be set forth in the Indenture (including baskets
measured as a percentage of Consolidated EBITDA or Total Assets);

in each case, at the option of the Issuer (the Issuer’s election to exercise such option in connection
with any Limited Condition Transaction, an ‘‘LCT Election’’), the date of determination of whether
any such action is permitted hereunder shall be deemed to be the date the definitive agreement for
such Limited Condition Transaction is entered into (the ‘‘LCT Test Date’’), and if, after giving Pro
Forma Effect to the Limited Condition Transaction, the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries
would have been permitted to take such action on the relevant LCT Test Date in compliance with
such ratio, test or basket, such ratio, test or basket shall be deemed to have been complied with.
For the avoidance of doubt, if the Issuer has made an LCT Election and any of the ratios, tests or
baskets for which compliance was determined or tested as of the LCT Test Date would have failed
to have been satisfied as a result of fluctuations in any such ratio, test or basket, including due to
fluctuations in Consolidated EBITDA or Total Assets, at or prior to the consummation of the relevant
transaction or action, such baskets, tests or ratios will not be deemed to have failed to have been
satisfied as a result of such fluctuations. If the Issuer has made an LCT Election for any Limited
Condition Transaction, then in connection with any event or transaction occurring after the relevant
LCT Test Date and prior to the earlier of the date on which such Limited Condition Transaction is
consummated or the date that the definitive agreement or date for redemption, repurchase,
defeasance, satisfaction and discharge or repayment specified in an irrevocable notice for such
Limited Condition Transaction is terminated, expires or passes, as applicable, without
consummation of such Limited Condition Transaction (a ‘‘Subsequent Transaction’’) in connection

195


-----

redeems, repays, defeases, retires or extinguishes any Indebtedness (in each case, other than
Indebtedness incurred or repaid under any revolving credit facility or line of credit in the ordinary
course of business for working capital purposes) or issues or redeems Disqualified Stock, in each
case, (i) during the applicable Test Period for which the Consolidated Coverage Ratio or any other

Test Period and prior to or simultaneously with the event for which the calculation of the
Consolidated Coverage Ratio or such other financial ratio or test under the Indenture is made (the
‘‘Ratio Calculation Date’’), then the Consolidated Coverage Ratio shall be calculated giving pro
forma effect to such Incurrence, assumption, Guarantee, redemption, repayment, defeasance,
retirement or extinguishment of Indebtedness, or such issuance or redemption of Disqualified Stock
(including pro forma application of the net proceeds therefrom), as the case may be, as if the same

203


-----

had occurred at the beginning of the applicable Test Period (and for the purposes of the numerator
of each of the Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio and the Consolidated Secured Net Leverage
Ratio, as if the same had occurred on the last day of the applicable Test Period). The Issuer may
elect to treat all or any portion of the commitment under any Indebtedness which is to be Incurred
as being Incurred as of the Ratio Calculation Date and any subsequent Incurrence of Indebtedness
under such commitment that was so treated shall not be deemed, for purposes of this calculation,
to be an Incurrence of additional Indebtedness.

For purposes of making the computation referred to above, any Specified Transaction that has
been made by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries during the applicable Test Period or
subsequent to the end of such Test Period and prior to or simultaneously with the Ratio Calculation
Date shall be calculated on a pro forma basis assuming that all Specified Transactions (and the
change in any associated interest coverage obligations, change in Consolidated EBITDA and the
component financial definitions used therein or change in Total Assets, as applicable, attributable to
any Specified Transaction) had occurred on the first day of such Test Period. If since the beginning
of any applicable Test Period any Person that subsequently became a Restricted Subsidiary or was
merged with or into the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries since the beginning of such Test
Period shall have made any Investment, acquisition, disposition, merger, consolidation,
amalgamation, or disposed or discontinued operation that would have required adjustment
pursuant to this definition, then the Consolidated Coverage Ratio or any other financial ratio or test
being calculated pursuant to the Indenture shall be calculated giving pro forma effect thereto for
such Test Period as if such Investment, acquisition, disposition, merger, consolidation,
amalgamation, or disposed or discontinued operation had occurred at the beginning of such Test
Period.

For purposes of this definition and the definitions of ‘‘Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio’’
and ‘‘Consolidated Secured Net Leverage Ratio’’, whenever pro forma effect is to be given to a
Specified Transaction, the pro forma calculations shall be made in good faith by a responsible
financial or chief accounting officer of the Issuer and may include, for the avoidance of doubt, the
amount of ‘‘run-rate’’ cost savings, operating expense reductions, restructuring charges and
expenses and synergies resulting from or relating to such Specified Transaction projected by the
Issuer in good faith to be realized as a result of actions taken or with respect to which substantial
steps have been taken or are expected to be taken (calculated on a pro forma basis as though
such cost savings, operating expense reductions, restructuring charges and expenses and
synergies had been realized on the first day of such period and as if such cost savings, operating
expense reductions, restructuring charges and expenses and synergies were realized during the
entirety of such period and such that ‘‘run-rate’’ means the full recurring benefit for a period that is
associated with any action taken, for which substantial steps have been taken or are expected to
be taken (including any savings expected to result from the elimination of a public target’s
compliance costs with public company requirements) net of the amount of actual benefits realized
during such period from such actions), and any such adjustments shall be included in the initial pro
forma calculations of such financial ratios or tests relating to such Specified Transaction (and in
respect of any subsequent pro forma calculations in which such Specified Transaction or cost
savings, operating expense reductions, restructuring charges and expenses and synergies are
given pro forma effect) and during any applicable subsequent Test Period for any subsequent
calculation of such financial ratios and tests; provided that (A) such amounts are reasonably
identifiable and factually supportable in the good faith judgment of the Issuer, (B) such actions are
taken or substantial steps with respect to such actions are or are expected to be taken no later
than 24 months after the date of such Specified Transaction, and (C) no amounts shall be added to
the extent duplicative of any amounts that are otherwise added back in computing Consolidated
EBITDA (or any other components thereof), whether through a pro forma adjustment or otherwise,
with respect to such period.

204


-----

If any Indebtedness bears a floating rate of interest and is being given pro forma effect, the
interest on such Indebtedness shall be calculated as if the rate in effect on the Ratio Calculation
Date had been the applicable rate for the entire applicable Test Period (taking into account any
Hedging Obligations applicable to such Indebtedness). Interest on a Capitalized Lease Obligation
shall be deemed to accrue at an interest rate reasonably determined by a responsible financial or
accounting officer of the Issuer to be the rate of interest implicit in such Capitalized Lease
Obligation in accordance with GAAP. Interest on Indebtedness on any revolving credit facility shall
be computed based on the average daily balance of such Indebtedness during the Test Period
except as set forth in the second paragraph of this definition. Interest on Indebtedness that may
optionally be determined at an interest rate based upon a factor of a prime or similar rate, a
eurocurrency interbank offered rate, or other rate, shall be determined to have been based upon
the rate actually chosen, or if none, then based upon such optional rate chosen as the Issuer may
designate.

‘‘Consolidated Depreciation and Amortization Expense’’ means, with respect to any Person for
any period, the total amount of depreciation and amortization expense, including the depreciation of

expenses, capitalized expenditures relating to software, license and intellectual property payments,
any lease related assets recorded in purchase accounting, customer acquisition costs,
unrecognized prior service costs and actuarial gains and losses related to pensions and other postemployment benefits, original issue discount resulting from the issuance of Indebtedness at less

states of the United States, may require that certain purchasers of notes take physical possession
of such notes in definitive form. The foregoing limitations may impair your ability to own, transfer,
pledge or grant any other security interest in Book-Entry Interests.

So long as the notes are held in global form, holders of Book-Entry Interests will not be
considered the owners or ‘‘holders’’ of Global Notes for any purpose. So long as the notes are held
in global form, the common depositary for Euroclear or Clearstream (including its nominees), will be
considered the sole holder of Global Notes for all purposes under the indenture that will govern the
notes. As such, participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable,
and indirect participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear, Clearstream and the participants
through which they own Book-Entry Interests to transfer their interests in or to exercise any rights of
holders under the indenture that will govern the notes. Neither we nor the trustee nor any of our
respective agents will have any responsibility or be liable for any aspect of the records relating to
the Book-Entry Interests. You can find information about certain other restrictions on the
transferability of the notes under ‘‘Transfer Restrictions’’ and ‘‘Plan of Distribution’’.

Except as described below, owners of interests in the Global Notes will not have notes
registered in their names, will not receive physical delivery of the notes in certificated form and will
not be considered the registered owners or holders thereof under the indenture that will govern the
notes for any purpose.

244


-----

The Issuer, the trustee, the registrar, the transfer agent, the paying agent and any of their
respective agents have not and will not have any responsibility or liability: (1) for any aspect of the
records of Euroclear or Clearstream, supervising or reviewing any of the records of Euroclear,
Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating to Book-Entry Interests, or for
payments made by Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating to
Book-Entry Interests or (2) for Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant. The
notes will be issued in denominations of e100,000 and in integral multiples of e1,000 in excess
thereof. We will not impose any fees or other charges in respect of the notes; however, owners of
the Book-Entry Interests may incur fees normally payable in respect of the maintenance and
operation of accounts in Euroclear or Clearstream.

**Issuance of Definitive Registered Notes**

Under the terms of the indenture that will govern the notes, owners of Book-Entry Interests will
receive Definitive Registered Notes only in the following circumstances: (1) if Euroclear or
Clearstream notifies the Issuer that it is unwilling or unable to continue to act as depositary and a
successor depositary is not appointed by the Issuer within 90 days or (2) if the owner of a
Book-Entry Interest requests such exchange in writing delivered through Euroclear or Clearstream
following an event of default under the indenture that will govern the notes which results in action
by the trustee pursuant to the enforcement provisions under the indenture that will govern the
notes.

In any such events described in clauses (1) or (2) the Issuer will issue Definitive Registered
Notes, registered in the name or names and issued in any approved denominations, requested by
or on behalf of Euroclear or Clearstream (in accordance with their respective customary procedures
and certain certification requirements and based upon directions received from participants
reflecting the beneficial ownership of the Book-Entry Interests). The Definitive Registered Notes will
bear a restrictive legend with respect to certain transfer restrictions, unless that legend is not
required by the indenture that will govern the notes or by applicable law.

In the case of the issue of Definitive Registered Notes, the holder of a Definitive Registered
Note may transfer such Definitive Registered Note by surrendering it to the registrar. In the event of
a partial transfer or a partial redemption of one Definitive Registered Note, a new Definitive
Registered Note will be issued to the transferee in respect of the part transferred, and a new
Definitive Registered Note will be issued to the transferor or the holder, as applicable, in respect of
the balance of the holding not transferred or redeemed, provided that a Definitive Registered Note
with respect to notes will only be issued in denominations of e100,000 or in integral multiples of
e1,000 in excess thereof.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued and a holder thereof claims that such Definitive
Registered Notes have been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken, or if such Definitive Registered
Notes are mutilated and are surrendered to the registrar or at the office of a transfer agent, we will
issue, and the trustee or an authenticating agent appointed by the trustee will authenticate, a
replacement.

The Issuer or the trustee may require a holder requesting replacement of a Definitive
Registered Note to furnish an indemnity bond sufficient in the judgment of both the trustee and the
Issuer to protect the Issuer, the trustee or the paying agent appointed pursuant to the indenture that
will govern the notes from any loss which any of them may suffer if a Definitive Registered Note is
replaced. We may charge for expenses in replacing a Definitive Registered Note.

In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Definitive Registered Note has become or
is about to become due and payable, or is about to be redeemed or purchased by the Issuer
pursuant to the provisions of the indenture that will govern the notes, the Issuer in its discretion

245


-----

may, instead of issuing a new Definitive Registered Note, pay, redeem or purchase such Definitive
Registered Note, as the case may be.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests only in
accordance with the indenture that will govern the notes and, if required, only after the transferor
first delivers to the transfer agent a written certification (in the form provided in the indenture that
will govern the notes) to the effect that such transfer will comply with the transfer restrictions
applicable to such Notes. See ‘‘Transfer Restrictions’’ and ‘‘Plan of Distribution’’.

The registrar shall be entitled to treat the registered holder of any Global Note as the absolute
owner thereof and no person will be liable for treating the registered holder as such. Ownership of
the Global Notes will be evidenced through registration from time to time at the registered office of
the Registrar, and such registration is a means of evidencing title to the notes. The Issuer will not
impose any fees or other charges in respect of the notes; however, holders of the Book-Entry
Interests may incur fees normally payable in respect of the maintenance and operation of accounts
in Euroclear or Clearstream.

**Redemption of Global Notes**

In the event any Global Note (or any portion thereof) is redeemed, the common depositary for
Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable, or its nominee, will distribute the amount received by it in
respect of the Global Note so redeemed to the holders of the Book-Entry Interests in such Global
Note from the amount received by it in respect of the redemption of such Global Note. The
redemption price payable in connection with the redemption of such Book-Entry Interests will be
equal to the amount received by Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, in connection with the
redemption of such Global Note (or any portion thereof). We understand that under existing
practices of Euroclear and Clearstream, if fewer than all of the notes are to be redeemed at any
time, Euroclear and Clearstream will credit their respective participants’ accounts on a proportionate
basis (with adjustments to prevent fractions), by lot or on such other basis as they deem fair and
appropriate; provided, however, that no Book-Entry Interest of less than e100,000 principal amount
at maturity may be redeemed in part.

**Payments on Global Notes**

Payments of amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes (including principal, interest and
premium, if any) will be made by the Issuer to the paying agent. The principal paying agent will, in
turn, make such payments to Euroclear and Clearstream, which will distribute such payments to
participants in accordance with their respective procedures. The Issuer will make payments of all
such amounts without deduction or withholding for or on account of any present or future taxes,
duties, assessments or governmental charges of whatever nature except as may be required by law.

Under the terms of the indenture that will govern the notes, the Issuer and the trustee will treat
the registered holder of the Global Notes, which will initially be the nominee of the common
depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, as the owner thereof for the purpose of receiving
payments and for all other purposes. Consequently, neither the Issuer nor the trustee or any of their
respective agents has or will have any responsibility or liability for:

   - any aspects of the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant
relating to or payments made on account of a Book-Entry Interest, for any such payments
made by Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant, or for maintaining,
supervising or reviewing the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect
participant relating to or payments made on account of a Book-Entry Interest; or

   - Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant.

246


-----

We expect that payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through such
participants will be governed by standing customer instructions and customary practices, as is now
the case with securities held for the accounts of customers registered in ‘‘street name’’. Payments
by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through participants are the responsibility of
such participants, as is now the case with securities held for the accounts of customers registered
in ‘‘street name’’.

**Currency and Payment for the Global Notes**

The principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of,
the notes, will be paid to holders of interests in such notes (the ‘‘Euroclear/Clearstream Holders’’)
through Euroclear and Clearstream in euro.

**Action by Owners of Book-Entry Interests**

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised us that they will take any action permitted to be
taken by a holder of the notes only at the direction of one or more participants to whose account
the Book-Entry Interests in the Global Notes are credited and only in respect of such portion of the
aggregate principal amount of notes as to which such participant or participants has or have given
such direction. Euroclear and Clearstream will not exercise any discretion in the granting of
consents, waivers or the taking of any other action in respect of the Global Notes. However, if there
is an event of default under the notes, each of Euroclear and Clearstream reserves the right to
exchange the Global Notes for Definitive Registered Notes in certificated form, and to distribute
such Definitive Registered Notes to their respective participants.

**Transfers**

Transfers between participants in Euroclear and Clearstream will be effected in accordance
with Euroclear and Clearstream rules and will be settled in immediately available funds. If a holder
requires physical delivery of Definitive Registered Notes for any reason, including to sell notes to
persons in jurisdictions that require physical delivery of securities or to pledge such notes, such
holder must transfer its interests in the Global Notes in accordance with the normal procedures of
Euroclear and Clearstream and in accordance with the procedures set forth in the indenture that
will govern the notes.

The Global Notes will bear a legend to the effect set forth in ‘‘Transfer Restrictions’’.
Book-Entry Interests in the Global Notes will be subject to the restrictions on transfer discussed in
‘‘Transfer Restrictions’’ and ‘‘Plan of Distribution’’.

Transfer of 144A Book-Entry Interests to persons wishing to take delivery of 144A Book-Entry
Interests will at all times be subject to such transfer restrictions. 144A Book-Entry Interests may be
transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of any Regulation S Book-Entry Interest only
upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the indenture that
will govern the notes) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with
Regulation S or Rule 144 (if applicable) under the Securities Act.

Any Book-Entry Interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes
delivery in the form of a Book-Entry Interest in the other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be
a Book-Entry Interest in the first mentioned Global Note and become a Book-Entry Interest in such
other Global Note, and, accordingly, will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and
other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in such other Global Note for as long as it
remains such a Book-Entry Interest.

247


-----

**Information Concerning Euroclear and Clearstream**

All Book-Entry Interests will be subject to the operations and procedures of Euroclear and/or
Clearstream, as applicable. We provide the following summaries of those operations and
procedures solely for the convenience of investors. The operations and procedures of each
settlement system are controlled by that settlement system and may be changed at any time. None
of the Issuer, the trustee or the initial purchasers is responsible for those operations or procedures.

The Issuer and each guarantor understand as follows with respect to Euroclear and
Clearstream: Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for participating organizations. They also
facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities transactions between their respective
participants through electronic book-entry changes in the accounts of such participants. Euroclear
and Clearstream provide various services to their participants, including the safekeeping,
administration, clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of internationally traded securities.
Euroclear and Clearstream interface with domestic securities markets. Euroclear and Clearstream
participants are financial institutions such as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks,
trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear and Clearstream is
also available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or
maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear or Clearstream participant, either directly or
indirectly.

Because Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on
behalf of indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to
pledge such interest to persons or entities that do not participate in Euroclear or Clearstream
systems, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a
definitive certificate for that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take
physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial
interests to such persons may be limited. In addition, owners of beneficial interests through the
Euroclear or Clearstream systems will receive distributions attributable to the 144A Global Notes
only through Euroclear or Clearstream participants.

**Global Clearance and Settlement under the Book-Entry System**

The notes represented by the Global Notes are expected to be listed on the Official List of the
Exchange. We expect that the notes will be accepted for clearance through the facilities of
Euroclear or Clearstream. Transfers of Book-Entry Interests in the Global Notes between participants
in Euroclear or Clearstream will be effected in the ordinary way in accordance with their respective
rules and operating procedures. The following description of the operations and procedures of
Euroclear and Clearstream is provided solely as a matter of convenience.

Although Euroclear and Clearstream currently follow the procedures described herein in order
to facilitate transfers of interests in the Global Notes among participants in Euroclear or
Clearstream, as the case may be, they are under no obligation to perform or continue to perform
such procedures, and such procedures may be discontinued or modified at any time. None of the
Issuer, any guarantor, the trustee or the paying agent will have any responsibility for the
performance by Euroclear or Clearstream or their respective participants or indirect participants of
their respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations.

**Initial Settlement**

Initial settlement for the notes will be made in euro. Book-Entry Interests owned through
Euroclear or Clearstream accounts will follow the settlement procedures applicable to conventional
eurobonds in registered form. Book-Entry Interests will be credited to the securities custody

248


-----

accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream holders on the business day following the settlement date
against payment for value on the settlement date.

**Secondary Market Trading**

The Book-Entry Interests will trade through participants of Euroclear or Clearstream and will
settle in same- day funds. Since the purchase determines the place of delivery, it is important to
establish at the time of trading of any Book-Entry Interests where both the purchaser’s and the
seller’s accounts are located to ensure that settlement can be made on the desired value date.

**Special Timing Considerations**

You should be aware that investors will only be able to make and receive deliveries, payments
and other communications involving notes through Euroclear or Clearstream on days when those
systems are open for business.

In addition, because of time-zone differences, there may be complications with completing
transactions involving Euroclear or Clearstream on the same business day as in the United States.
U.S. investors who wish to transfer their interests in the notes, or to receive or make a payment or
delivery of notes, on a particular day, may find that the transactions will not be performed until the
next business day in Brussels if Euroclear is used, or Luxembourg if Clearstream is used.

**TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS**

Because of the following restrictions, purchasers are advised to consult legal counsel prior to
making any offer, sale, resale, pledge or other transfer of the notes offered hereby. We do not
intend to file a registration statement to register resales of the notes under the Securities Act or the
securities laws of any other jurisdiction nor do we intend to offer to exchange the notes for notes
registered under the Securities Act.

We have not registered the notes under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any other
jurisdiction, and the notes may not be offered or sold within the United States or to, or for the
account or benefit of, any U.S. person except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction
not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and the securities laws of any
applicable jurisdiction. Accordingly, the notes are being offered and sold only (A) to persons
reasonably believed to be ‘‘qualified institutional buyers’’ (as defined in Rule 144A) in compliance
with Rule 144A and (B) outside the United States to persons other than U.S. persons in reliance
upon Regulation S. Terms used above and otherwise in this section of this offering circular have the
meanings given to them by Regulation S and Rule 144A under the Securities Act.

Each purchaser of notes will be deemed to have represented and agreed as follows:

(1) You understand and acknowledge that the notes have not been registered under
the Securities Act or any other applicable securities laws and that the notes are being offered
for resale in transactions not requiring registration under the Securities Act or any other
securities laws, including sales pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act, and, unless so
registered, may not be offered, sold or otherwise transferred except in compliance with the
registration requirements of the Securities Act and any other applicable securities laws,
pursuant to an exemption therefrom, or in a transaction not subject thereto, and in each case
in compliance with the conditions for transfer set forth in paragraph (3) below.

You are not our ‘‘affiliate’’ (as defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act), you are not
acting on our behalf and you are either:

(a) a qualified institutional buyer and are aware that any sale of the notes to you
will be made in reliance on Rule 144A and such acquisition will be for your own account
or for the account of another qualified institutional buyer; or

(b) not a ‘‘U.S. person’’ as defined in Regulation S or purchasing for the account
or benefit of a U.S. person (other than a distributor) and you are purchasing the notes in
an offshore transaction in accordance with Regulation S.

(2) You acknowledge that none of us, the initial purchasers or any person representing
us or the initial purchasers has made any representation to you with respect to us or the offer
or sale of any of the notes, other than the information contained in this offering circular, which
offering circular has been delivered to you and upon which you are relying in making your
investment decision with respect to the notes. You acknowledge that the initial purchasers
make no representation or warranty as to the accuracy or completeness of this offering
circular. You have had access to such financial and other information concerning us and the
notes, including an opportunity to ask questions of, and request information from, us and the
initial purchasers.

(3) You are purchasing the notes for your own account, or for one or more investor
accounts for which you are acting as a fiduciary or agent, in each case for investment, and
not with a view to, or for offer or sale in connection with, any distribution thereof in violation of
the Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction, subject to any requirement of
law that the disposition of your property or the property of such investor account or accounts

250


-----

be at all times within your or their control and subject to your or their ability to resell such
notes pursuant to Rule 144A, Regulation S or any other available exemption from registration
available under the Securities Act. You agree on your own behalf and on behalf of any investor
account for which you are purchasing the notes, and each subsequent holder of the notes by
its acceptance thereof will agree, to offer, sell or otherwise transfer such notes prior to the date
which is one year after the later of the date of the original issue of the notes and the last date
on which we or any of our affiliates were the owner of such notes (or any predecessor thereto)
or such later date, if any, as may be required by applicable law (the ‘‘Resale Restriction
Termination Date’’) only:

(a) to us;

(b) pursuant to a registration statement which has been declared effective under
the Securities Act;

(c) for so long as the notes are eligible for resale pursuant to Rule 144A, to a
person you reasonably believe is a qualified institutional buyer that purchases for its own
account or for the account of another qualified institutional buyer to whom you give
notice that the transfer is being made in reliance on Rule 144A;

(d) in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144 under the Securities
Act;

(e) pursuant to offers and sales to non-U.S. persons occurring outside the United
States within the meaning of Regulation S under the Securities Act; or

(f) pursuant to any other available exemption from the registration requirements
of the Securities Act;

subject in each of the foregoing cases to any requirement of law that the disposition of the
seller’s property or the property of an investor account or accounts be within the seller or
account’s control, and in compliance with any applicable state securities laws and the
securities laws of any other applicable jurisdiction.

The foregoing restrictions on resale will not apply subsequent to the Resale Restriction
Termination Date. You acknowledge that we, the trustee and the registrar reserve the right
prior to any offer, sale or other transfer of the notes offered hereby pursuant to clause (e)
above prior to the end of the 40-day distribution compliance period within the meaning of
Regulation S under the Securities Act or pursuant to clause (f) above prior to the Resale
Restriction Termination Date of the notes to require the delivery of an opinion of counsel,
certifications and/or other information satisfactory to the Issuer, the trustee and the registrar.

Each purchaser acknowledges that each note offered hereby will contain a legend
substantially in the following form:

‘‘THIS NOTE HAS NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS
AMENDED (THE ‘‘SECURITIES ACT’’) OR THE SECURITIES LAWS OF ANY OTHER

(4) You acknowledge that the registrar will not be required to accept for registration of
transfer any notes acquired by you, except upon presentation of evidence satisfactory to us

**CERTAIN INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

**Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations**

The following is a summary of certain United States federal income tax consequences of the
purchase, ownership and disposition of the notes as of the date of this offering circular, but does
not purport to be a complete analysis of all potential United States federal income tax
considerations. Except for the discussions below under ‘‘—Foreign Account Tax Compliance’’, this
summary is limited to consequences relevant to a ‘‘U.S. holder’’ (as defined below). This summary
is based on the Code, United States Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder, published
administrative positions of the United States Internal Revenue Service (the ‘‘IRS’’) and judicial
decisions, all as in effect on the date hereof. Those authorities may be changed or subject to new
interpretations, possibly on a retroactive basis, so as to result in United States federal income tax
consequences different from those summarized below. We have not sought, and do not expect to
seek, any ruling from the IRS with respect to the statements made and the conclusions reached in
the following summary and there can be no assurance that the IRS or a court will agree with our
statements and conclusions or that a court would not sustain any challenge by the IRS in the event
of litigation.

This summary applies only to U.S. holders of notes (and non-U.S. holders, solely in the case
of ‘‘—Foreign Account Tax Compliance’’) that purchase the notes in this offering for cash at the
applicable price for the notes set forth on in the cover page of this offering circular, and that will
hold the notes as ‘‘capital assets’’ within the meaning of section 1221 of the Code (generally,
property held for investment). This summary is general in nature and does not purport to deal with
all aspects of United States federal income taxation that might be relevant to particular holders in
light of their personal investment circumstances or status (including the Medicare contribution tax
on net investment income), nor does it address tax considerations applicable to investors that may
be subject to special treatment under the United States federal income tax laws, such as:

   - a broker-dealer, or dealer or trader in securities or currencies;

   - a bank or other financial institution;

   - a regulated investment company;

   - a real estate investment trust;

   - a tax-exempt entity;

   - an insurance company;

   - a partnership, S-corporation or other pass-through entity for United States federal income
tax purposes or investors in such entities;

   - an individual retirement or other tax-deferred accounts;

   - a person holding the notes as part of a hedge, straddle, synthetic security, integrated,
conversion or constructive sale transaction;

   - a trader in securities that has elected the mark-to-market method of accounting for its
securities;

   - a person liable for alternative minimum tax;

   - a U.S. holder whose ‘‘functional currency’’ is not the U.S. dollar;

   - non-U.S. holders who are former citizens or residents of the United States; or

   - persons that actually or constructively own 10% or more of our voting stock.

254


-----

In the case of a beneficial owner of notes that is classified as a partnership for United States
federal income tax purposes, the tax treatment of a partner will generally depend upon the tax
status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. If you are a partnership or a partner in a
partnership considering an investment in the notes, you should consult your own tax advisors.

This summary does not represent a detailed description of the United States federal income
tax consequences to you in light of your particular circumstances and does not address the effect
of any applicable United States federal tax laws other than income tax laws (such as estate or gift
tax laws), any state, local or non-United States tax laws or any applicable tax treaty. It is not
intended to be, and should not be construed to be, legal or tax advice to any particular purchaser
of notes. If you are considering purchasing notes, you should consult your own tax advisors
**concerning the particular United States federal income tax consequences to you of the**
**purchase, ownership or disposition of the notes, as well as the consequences to you arising**
**under any other United States federal tax laws and the laws of any other taxing jurisdiction.**

**_Additional Payments_**

We may be required in certain circumstances to pay amounts in redemption of the notes in
addition to the stated principal amount of and stated interest on the notes (e.g., in the case of a
change in control as described in ‘‘Description of Notes—Change of Control’’). Although the issue
is not free from doubt, we intend to take the position that the possibility of payment of additional
amounts in redemption of the notes does not result in the notes being treated as contingent
payment debt instruments under applicable Treasury regulations. This position will be based on our
determination that, as of the date of the issuance of the notes, the possibility that additional
amounts in redemption of the notes will have to be paid is, in the aggregate, a remote or incidental
contingency within the meaning of applicable Treasury regulations.

Our determination that such contingencies are remote or incidental is binding on a holder,
unless such holder explicitly discloses to the IRS on its tax return for the year during which it
acquires the notes that it is taking a different position. However, our position is not binding on the
IRS. If the IRS takes a contrary position to that described above, a holder subject to United States
federal income taxation may be required to accrue interest income on the notes based upon a
comparable yield, regardless of the holder’s regular method of accounting. The ‘‘comparable yield’’
is the yield at which we would issue a fixed rate debt instrument with no contingent payments, but
with terms and conditions otherwise similar to those of the notes. Accruing interest based upon the
comparable yield may require a holder to accrue ordinary interest income on the notes in an
amount greater than the stated interest. In addition, any gain on a sale, exchange, redemption,
retirement or other taxable disposition of the notes would be recharacterized as ordinary income
(rather than capital gain).

You should consult your own tax advisors regarding the tax consequences of the notes being
treated as contingent payment debt instruments. The remainder of this discussion assumes that the
notes will not be treated as contingent payment debt instruments.

**_U.S. Holders_**

The following is a summary of certain United States federal income tax consequences that will
apply to you if you are a U.S. holder of the notes. As used herein, a ‘‘U.S. holder’’ means a
beneficial owner of the notes that is, for United States federal income tax purposes, any of the
following:

   - an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;

255


-----

   - a corporation created or organized under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or
the District of Columbia;

   - an estate, the income of which is subject to United States federal income taxation
regardless of its source; or

   - a trust if (1) it is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and
one or more United States persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of
the trust or (2) in the case of a trust that was treated as a domestic trust under the law in
effect before 1997, it has a valid election in effect under applicable United States Treasury
regulations to be treated as a United States person.

_Stated Interest._ Stated interest on the notes will generally be taxable to a U.S. holder as
ordinary income at the time such interest is received or accrued, depending on the holder’s regular
method of accounting for United States federal income tax purposes.

A U.S. holder that uses the cash method of tax accounting will be required to include in
income the U.S. dollar value of the euro-denominated interest payment on a note based on the
spot rate of exchange on the date of receipt, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted
into U.S. dollars. No foreign currency exchange gain or loss will be recognized with respect to the
receipt of such payment (other than foreign currency exchange gain or loss realized on the
disposition of the euros so received, see ‘‘—Transaction in Euros’’, below).

A U.S. holder that uses the accrual method of tax accounting will accrue interest income on a
notes in euros and translate the amount accrued into U.S. dollars based on:

   - the average exchange rate in effect during the interest accrual period, or portion thereof,
within such U.S. holder’s taxable year; or

   - at such U.S. holder’s election, at the spot rate of exchange on (1) the last day of the accrual
period, or the last day of the taxable year within such accrual period if the accrual period
spans more than one taxable year (for the portion of the accrual period ending on the last
day of such taxable year), or (2) the date of receipt, if such date is within five business days
of the last day of the accrual period. Such election must be applied consistently by the U.S.
holder to all debt instruments from year to year and can be changed only with the consent
of the IRS.

A U.S. holder that uses the accrual method of tax accounting will recognize foreign currency
exchange gain or loss on the receipt of an interest payment equal to the difference between (i) the
value of the euros received as interest, as translated into U.S. dollars using the spot rate of
exchange on the date of receipt, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S.
dollars, and (ii) the U.S. dollar amount previously included in income with respect to such payment.
Such foreign currency exchange gain or loss will be treated as ordinary income or loss that is U.S.
source (for purposes of computing a U.S. holder’s foreign tax credit limitation) but generally will not
be treated as an adjustment to interest income received on the notes.

Interest income to a U.S. holder will be treated as foreign source income for purposes of
calculating that holder’s foreign tax credit limitation. The limitation on foreign taxes eligible for the
U.S. foreign tax credit is calculated separately with respect to specific classes of income. The rules
governing foreign tax credits are complex and, therefore, U.S. holders should consult their own tax
advisers regarding the availability of foreign tax credits in their particular circumstances.

_Sale, Exchange, Redemption, Retirement or Other Taxable Disposition of a Note._ Upon a sale,
exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a note, a U.S. holder generally will
recognize gain or loss equal to the difference, if any, between (i) the amount realized upon the
disposition and (ii) the holder’s adjusted tax basis in the note. The amount realized will generally be

256


-----

equal to the sum of the amount of cash and the fair market value of any property received in
exchange for the note (which, in the case of euros received, would equal the U.S. dollar value of
such euros calculated as discussed below) less any portion allocable to accrued and unpaid stated
interest, which will be taxed as ordinary interest income (as described above under ‘‘—Stated
Interest’’) to the extent not previously so taxed. A U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in a note
generally will be the cost for that note (i.e., the U.S. dollar value of the euro purchase price
calculated at the spot rate of exchange on the settlement date of purchase). Except with respect to
any gain or loss attributable to changes in the euro to U.S. dollar exchange rate, as discussed
below, any such gain or loss will be capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if
the U.S. holder has held the note for more than one year. In general, long-term capital gains of a
non-corporate U.S. holder are taxed at lower rates than those applicable to ordinary income. The
deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. U.S. holders should consult their own tax
advisors as to the deductibility of capital losses in their particular circumstances.

Except as provided in the next sentence, an amount realized (from a disposition of a note) in
the form of euros will equal the U.S. dollar value of such euros based on the spot rate of exchange
on the date of disposition. However, if the notes are traded on an established securities market, a
U.S. holder that uses the cash method of tax accounting, and if such U.S. holder so elects, a U.S.
holder that uses the accrual method of tax accounting, will determine the U.S. dollar values of its
amount realized on the disposition of a note by translating euro amounts at the spot rate of
exchange on the settlement date of the disposition. The election available to accrual basis U.S.
holders discussed above must be applied consistently by the U.S. holder to all debt instruments
from year to year and can be changed only with the consent of the IRS.

Any gain or loss recognized by a U.S. holder on a sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or
other taxable disposition of a note generally will be treated as ordinary income or loss to the extent
that the gain or loss is attributable to changes in the euro to U.S. dollar exchange rate during the
period in which the U.S. holder held such note. Such foreign currency exchange gain or loss will
equal the difference between the U.S. dollar value of the euro purchase price of the note calculated
at the spot rate of exchange on the date (i) the note is disposed of (or the spot rate on the
settlement date, if applicable) and (ii) the U.S. holder purchased the note (or the spot rate on the
settlement date, if applicable). The recognition of such foreign currency exchange gain or loss will
be limited to the amount of overall gain or loss recognized on the disposition of a note (including
with respect to any interest payments received as part of the disposition). A U.S. holder that
computes its amount realized based on the exchange rate on the disposition date (as opposed to
the settlement date) will recognize additional exchange gain or loss (taxable as ordinary income or
loss that is U.S. source (for purposes of computing a U.S. holder’s foreign tax credit limitation)) to
the extent that the U.S. dollar/euro exchange rate fluctuates between the disposition date and the
settlement date.

Any gain or loss recognized on the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable
disposition of a note (including any foreign currency exchange gain or loss) generally will be
treated as U.S. source (for purposes of computing a U.S. holder’s foreign tax credit limitation).

_Transaction in Euros._ Euros received as interest on, or on a disposition of, a note will have a
tax basis equal to its U.S. dollar value at the time such interest is received or at the time such
proceeds from disposition are received. The amount of gain or loss recognized by a U.S. holder on
the sale or other disposition of such euros will be equal to the difference, if any, between (i) the
amount of U.S. dollars, or the fair market value in U.S. dollars of the other property received in such
sale or other disposition, and (ii) the U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in such euros. A U.S. holder
that purchases a note with previously owned euros will generally recognize gain or loss in an
amount equal to the difference, if any, between such U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in such euros
and the U.S. dollar fair market value of such note on the settlement date of such purchase.

257


-----

Any such foreign currency gain or loss generally will be ordinary income or loss that is U.S.
source (for purposes of computing a U.S. holder’s foreign tax credit limitation) and will not be
treated as interest income or expense. The conversion of U.S. dollars to foreign currency and the
immediate use of such foreign currency to purchase a note generally will not result in any
exchange gain or loss for a U.S. holder.

_Information Reporting and Backup Withholding._ In general, we must report certain information
to the IRS with respect to payments of stated interest on a note, and payments of the proceeds of
the sale or other disposition (including a retirement or redemption) of a note, to certain U.S.
holders. The applicable withholding agent will be required to impose backup withholding in respect
of such amounts, at a rate of 28%, if (i) the payee fails to furnish a taxpayer identification number
(‘‘TIN’’) to the applicable withholding agent or to establish an exemption from backup withholding,
(ii) the IRS notifies the applicable withholding agent that the TIN furnished by the payee is incorrect,
(iii) there has been a notified payee underreporting described in section 3406(c) of the Code, or
(iv) the payee has not certified under penalties of perjury that it has furnished a correct TIN and that
the IRS has not notified the payee that it is subject to backup withholding under the Code. United
States backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup
withholding rules from a payment to a U.S. holder will be allowed as a credit against the holder’s
United States federal income tax liability, if any, and may entitle the holder to a refund, provided that
the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.

_Reportable Transactions._ Under applicable Treasury regulations, a U.S. holder who
participates in ‘‘reportable transactions’’ (as defined in the Treasury regulations) must attach to its
United States federal income tax return a disclosure statement on IRS Form 8886. The Treasury
regulations could be interpreted to cover transactions generally not regarded as tax shelters,
including certain foreign currency transactions. Under the relevant rules, a U.S. holder may be
required to treat a foreign currency exchange loss arising from an interest payment on or
disposition of the notes as a reportable transaction if this loss exceeds the relevant threshold in the
Treasury regulations. U.S. holders should consult their own tax advisors to determine the tax
reporting obligations, if any, including any requirement to file IRS Form 8886, with respect to the
ownership or disposition of the notes or any related transaction such as the disposition of any
euros received in respect of the notes, and the significant penalties for noncompliance.

_Information Regarding Foreign Financial Assets and Tax Return Disclosure Requirement._
Certain U.S. holders are required to report information on IRS Form 8938 on the holding of certain
foreign financial assets, including debt of foreign entities, if the aggregate value of all of these
assets exceeds $50,000. The notes are expected to constitute foreign financial assets subject to
these requirements, unless the notes are held in an account at a domestic financial institution. U.S.
holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the application of this reporting obligation, and
the significant penalties for noncompliance.

**_Foreign Account Tax Compliance_**

Pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code (provisions commonly known as
‘‘FATCA’’), a ‘‘foreign financial institution’’ may be required to withhold U.S. federal tax (at a rate of
30%) on certain pass-through payments made after December 31, 2018 to the extent such
payments are treated as attributable to certain U.S. source payments. Debt obligations that
generate solely non-US source interest and are issued on or prior to the date that is six months
after the date on which applicable final regulations defining ‘‘foreign passthru payments’’ are filed
generally would be ‘‘grandfathered’’ unless such obligations are materially modified after such date.
As of the date of this offering circular, applicable final regulations have not yet been filed.
Accordingly, if we are treated as a foreign financial institution, FATCA would apply to payments on

258


-----

the notes only if there is a significant modification of the notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes
after the expiration of this grandfathering period. Non-U.S. governments have entered into
intergovernmental agreements with the United States (and additional non-U.S. governments are
expected to enter into such agreements) to implement FATCA in a manner that alters the rules
described herein. Holders should consult their own tax advisors on how these rules may apply to
their investment in the notes. In the event any withholding under FATCA is imposed with respect to
any payments on the notes, there generally will be no additional amounts payable to compensate
for the withheld amount.

**Certain Non-U.S. Tax Considerations**

**_Summary of Dutch Tax Considerations_**

The following is a general summary of certain material Netherlands tax consequences of the
acquisition, holding and disposal of the notes. This summary does not purport to describe all
possible tax considerations or consequences that may be relevant to a holder or prospective holder
of notes and does not purport to deal with the tax consequences applicable to all categories of
investors, some of which (such as trusts or similar arrangements) may be subject to special rules.
In view of its general nature, this general summary should be treated with corresponding caution.
Holders or prospective holders of notes should consult with their own tax advisors with regard to
the tax consequences of investing in the notes in their particular circumstances. The discussion
below is included for general information purposes only.

Except as otherwise indicated, this summary only addresses Netherlands national tax
legislation and published regulations, whereby the Netherlands means the part of the Kingdom of
the Netherlands located in Europe, as in effect on the date hereof and as interpreted in published
case law until this date, including, for the avoidance of doubt, the tax rates and brackets applicable
on the date hereof, without prejudice to any amendment introduced at a later date and/or
implemented with or without retroactive effect.

_Withholding Tax_

All payments made by the Issuer under the notes may be made free of withholding or
deduction of, for or on account of any taxes of whatever nature imposed, levied, withheld or
assessed by the Netherlands or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein.

_Taxes on Income and Capital Gains_

Please note that the summary in this section does not describe the Netherlands tax
consequences for:

(i) holders of notes if such holders, and in the case of individuals, his or her partner or
certain of their relatives by blood or marriage in the direct line (including foster children),
have a substantial interest (aanmerkelijk belang) or deemed substantial interest (fictief
_aanmerkelijk belang) in the Issuer under the Netherlands Income Tax Act 2001 (Wet_
_inkomstenbelasting 2001). Generally speaking, a holder of securities in a company is_
considered to hold a substantial interest in such company, if such holder alone or, in the
case of individuals, together with his or her partner (as defined in The Netherlands
Income Tax Act 2001), directly or indirectly, holds (i) an interest of 5% or more of the total
issued and outstanding capital of that company or of 5% or more of the issued and
outstanding capital of a certain class of shares of that company; or (ii) rights to acquire,
directly or indirectly, such interest; or (iii) profit sharing rights in that company that relate
to 5% or more of the company’s annual profits and/or to 5% or more of the company’s
liquidation proceeds. A deemed substantial interest may arise if a substantial interest (or

259


-----

part thereof) in a company has been disposed of, or is deemed to have been disposed
of, on a non-recognition basis;

(ii) pension funds, investment institutions (fiscale beleggingsinstellingen), exempt investment
institutions (vrijgestelde beleggingsinstellingen) (as defined in The Netherlands Corporate
Income Tax Act 1969; Wet op de vennootschapsbelasting 1969) and other entities that
are, in whole or in part, not subject to or exempt from Netherlands corporate income tax;
and

(iii) holders of notes who are individuals for whom the notes or any benefit derived from the
notes are a remuneration or deemed to be a remuneration for activities performed by
such holders or certain individuals related to such holders (as defined in The Netherlands
Income Tax Act 2001).

_Netherlands Resident Entities_

Generally speaking, if the holder of notes is an entity (which includes an association, a
partnership and a mutual fund taxable as a corporate entity) that is a resident or deemed to be
resident of the Netherlands for Netherlands corporate income tax purposes (a ‘‘Netherlands
Resident Entity’’), any payment under the notes or any gain or loss realized on the disposal or
deemed disposal of the notes is subject to Netherlands corporate income tax at a rate of 20% with
respect to taxable profits up to e200,000 and 25% with respect to taxable profits in excess of that
amount.

A holder of notes will not be deemed to be resident in the Netherlands for Dutch tax purposes
by reason only of the execution and/or enforcement of the documents relating to the issue of notes
or the performance by the Issuer of its obligations under such documents or under the notes.

_Netherlands Resident Individuals_

If a holder of notes is an individual, resident or deemed to be resident of the Netherlands for
Netherlands income tax purposes (a ‘‘Netherlands Resident Individual’’), any payment under the
notes or any gain or loss realized on the disposal or deemed disposal of the notes is taxable at the
progressive income tax rates (with a maximum of 52%), if:

(i) the notes are attributable to an enterprise from which the holder of notes derives a share
of the profit, whether as an entrepreneur (ondernemer) or as a person who has a co
entitlement to the net worth (medegerechtigd tot het vermogen) of such enterprise
without being a shareholder (as defined in The Netherlands Income Tax Act 2001); or

(ii) the holder of notes is considered to perform activities with respect to the notes that go
beyond ordinary asset management (normaal, actief vermogensbeheer) or derives
benefits from the notes that are taxable as benefits from other activities (resultaat uit
_overige werkzaamheden)._

If the above-mentioned conditions (i) and (ii) do not apply to the individual holder of notes,
such holder will be taxed annually on a deemed, variable return (with a maximum of, currently,
5.39%) of his/her net investment assets (rendementsgrondslag) for the year at an income tax rate of
30%.

The net investment assets for the year are the fair market value of the investment assets less
the allowable liabilities on 1 January of the relevant calendar year. The notes are included as
investment assets. A tax free allowance may be available. Actual income, gains or losses in respect
of the notes are as such not subject to Netherlands income tax.

260


-----

For the net investment assets on 1 January 2017, a deemed return between 2.87% and 5.39%
(depending on the aggregate amount of such holder’s net investment assets on 1 January 2017)
will be applied. The deemed, variable return will be adjusted annually.

_Non-residents of the Netherlands_

A holder of notes that is neither a Netherlands Resident Entity nor a Netherlands Resident
Individual will not be subject to Netherlands taxes on income or capital gains in respect of any
payment under the notes or in respect of any gain or loss realized on the disposal or deemed
disposal of the notes, provided that:

(i) such holder does not have an interest in an enterprise or deemed enterprise (as defined
in The Netherlands Income Tax Act 2001 and The Netherlands Corporate Income Tax Act
1969) which, in whole or in part, is either effectively managed in the Netherlands or
carried on through a permanent establishment, a deemed permanent establishment or a
permanent representative in the Netherlands and to which enterprise or part of an
enterprise the notes are attributable; and

(ii) in the event the holder is an individual, such holder does not carry out any activities in
the Netherlands with respect to the notes that go beyond ordinary asset management
and does not derive benefits from the notes that are taxable as benefits from other
activities in the Netherlands.

_Gift and Inheritance Taxes_

_Residents of the Netherlands_

Gift or inheritance taxes will arise in the Netherlands with respect to a transfer of the notes by
way of a gift by, or on the death of, a holder of such notes who is resident or deemed resident of
the Netherlands at the time of the gift or his/her death.

_Non-residents of the Netherlands_

No Netherlands gift or inheritance taxes will arise on the transfer of the notes by way of gift by,
or on the death of, a holder of notes who is neither resident nor deemed to be resident in the
Netherlands, unless:

(i) in the case of a gift of a note by an individual who at the date of the gift was neither
resident nor deemed to be resident in the Netherlands, such individual dies within
180 days after the date of the gift, while being resident or deemed to be resident in the
Netherlands; or

(ii) the transfer is otherwise construed as a gift or inheritance made by, or on behalf of, a
person who, at the time of the gift or death, is or is deemed to be resident in the
Netherlands.

For purposes of Netherlands gift and inheritance taxes, amongst others, a person that holds
the Netherlands nationality will be deemed to be resident in the Netherlands if such person has
been resident in the Netherlands at any time during the ten years preceding the date of the gift or
his/her death. Additionally, for purposes of Netherlands gift tax, amongst others, a person not
holding the Netherlands nationality will be deemed to be resident in the Netherlands if such person
has been resident in the Netherlands at any time during the twelve months preceding the date of
the gift. Applicable tax treaties may override deemed residency.

261


-----

_Value added tax (‘‘VAT’’)_

No Netherlands VAT will be payable by the holders of the notes on (i) any payment in
consideration for the issue of the notes or (ii) any payment of interest or principal by the Issuer
under the notes.

_Other taxes and duties_

No Netherlands registration tax, transfer tax, stamp duty or any other similar documentary tax
or duty will be payable by the holders of the notes in respect of or in connection with (i) the
execution and/or enforcement (including by legal proceedings and including the enforcement of
any foreign judgment in the courts of the Netherlands) of the documents relating to the issue of the
notes, (ii) any payment by the Issuer under the notes, (iii) the performance by the Issuer of its
obligations under such documents or under the notes, or (iv) the transfer of the notes.

262

**CERTAIN ERISA CONSIDERATIONS**

The following is a summary of certain considerations associated with the purchase and
holding of the notes by employee benefit plans that are subject to Title I of the U.S. Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (‘‘ERISA’’ and each employee benefit plan
subject to Title I of ERISA, an ‘‘ERISA Plan’’), plans, individual retirement accounts and other
arrangements that are subject to Section 4975 of the Code and entities whose underlying assets
are deemed to include ‘‘plan assets’’ of any of the foregoing (each, a ‘‘Benefit Plan Investor’’) and
plans or other arrangements that are subject to any provisions under any other federal, state, local,
non-U.S. or other laws or regulations that are similar to such provisions of ERISA or the Code
(collectively, ‘‘Similar Laws’’ and such plans together with Benefit Plan Investors referred to herein
as ‘‘Plans’’).

**General Fiduciary Matters**

ERISA and the Code impose certain requirements and duties on Benefit Plan Investors and on
those persons who are fiduciaries of a Benefit Plan Investor. Under ERISA and the Code, any
person who exercises any discretionary authority or control over the administration of such a
Benefit Plan Investor or the management or disposition of the assets of such a Benefit Plan
Investor, or who renders investment advice for a fee or other compensation to such a Benefit Plan
Investor, is generally considered to be a ‘‘fiduciary’’ (within the meaning of Section 3(21) of ERISA
and Section 4975 of the Code) of the Benefit Plan Investor.

In considering an investment in the notes of a portion of the assets of any Benefit Plan
Investor, a fiduciary must, among other things and as applicable: (1) discharge its duties solely in
the interest of the participants and beneficiaries of such Benefit Plan Investor and for the exclusive
purpose of providing benefits to such participants and beneficiaries and defraying reasonable
expenses of administering the Benefit Plan Investor; (2) act prudently with respect to the Benefit
Plan Investor; (3) diversify the investments of such Benefit Plan Investor so as to minimize the risk
of large losses; and (4) discharge its duties in accordance with the documents and instruments
governing such Benefit Plan Investor. In addition, fiduciaries are generally required to hold all assets
of a Benefit Plan Investor in trust and to maintain the indicia of ownership of such assets within the
jurisdiction of the district courts of the United States. A fiduciary of a Plan should determine whether
the investment in the notes satisfies these requirements, whether such investment is in accordance
with the documents and instruments governing the Plan and whether such investment is in
accordance with the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code or any Similar Law relating to a
fiduciary’s duties to such Plan including, without limitation, the prudence, diversification, delegation
of control and prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA, the Code and any other applicable
Similar Laws.

Each Benefit Plan Investor should consider the fact that none of the Issuer, the initial
purchasers, the trustee, nor any of their respective affiliates (the ‘‘Transaction Parties’’) will act as a
fiduciary to any Benefit Plan Investor with respect to the decision to purchase or hold the notes and
is not undertaking to provide impartial investment advice, or to give advice in a fiduciary capacity,
with respect to such decision. The decision to purchase and hold the notes must be made by each
prospective Benefit Plan Investor purchaser on an arm’s length basis. In addition, each Benefit Plan
Investor purchasing the notes must generally be represented by a fiduciary independent of the
Transaction Parties (which may not be an owner of an IRA, in the case of an investor that is an IRA)
that (i) is capable of evaluating investment risks independently, both in general and with regard to
the prospective investment in the notes, (ii) has exercised independent judgment in evaluating
whether to invest the assets of such Benefit Plan Investor in the notes and (iii) is a bank, an
insurance carrier, a registered investment adviser, a registered broker-dealer or an independent
fiduciary with at least $50 million of assets under management or control.

263


-----

**Prohibited Transaction Issues**

A purchaser who is considering acquiring the notes with the assets of a Plan must consider
whether the acquisition and holding of such notes will constitute or result in a non-exempt
prohibited transaction under ERISA or the Code or a violation of any applicable Similar Law.
Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit certain transactions that involve a
Benefit Plan Investor and a ‘‘party in interest’’ (within the meaning of Section 3(14) of ERISA) or a
‘‘disqualified person’’ (within the meaning of Section 4975(e)(2) of the Code) with respect to such
Benefit Plan Investor, unless a statutory, class or individual prohibited transaction exemption (as
discussed below) is available. Examples of such prohibited transactions include, but are not limited
to, sales or exchanges of property (such as the notes) or extensions of credit between a Benefit
Plan Investor and a party in interest or disqualified person. Section 406(b) of ERISA and
Sections 4975(c)(1)(E) and (F) of the Code generally prohibit fiduciaries from dealing with the
assets of Benefit Plan Investors for their own benefit (for example when a fiduciary of a Benefit Plan
Investor uses its position to cause such Benefit Plan Investor to make investments in connection
with which the fiduciary (or a party related to the fiduciary) receives a fee or other consideration). A
party in interest or disqualified person who has engaged in a non-exempt prohibited transaction
may be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code and
such transaction may have to be rescinded. The fiduciary of a Benefit Plan Investor that engaged in
such non-exempt prohibited transaction may also be subject to penalties and liabilities under ERISA
and the Code.

The acquisition and/or holding of notes by a Benefit Plan Investor with respect to which the
Issuer, a guarantor, Bain Capital or an initial purchaser is considered a party in interest or a
disqualified person may constitute or result in a direct or indirect prohibited transaction under
Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code, unless the investment is acquired and is
held in accordance with an applicable statutory, class or individual prohibited transaction
exemption. ERISA and the Code contain certain exemptions from the prohibited transactions
described above, and the U.S. Department of Labor has issued several prohibited transaction class
exemptions (‘‘PTCEs’’) that may apply to the acquisition and holding of the notes. These PTCEs
include, without limitation, PTCE 84-14 respecting transactions determined by independent qualified
professional asset managers, PTCE 90-1 respecting investments by insurance company pooled
separate accounts, PTCE 91-38 respecting investments by bank collective investment funds,
PTCE 95-60 respecting life insurance company general accounts and PTCE 96-23 respecting
transactions determined by in-house asset managers. In addition, Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and
Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code provide relief from the prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA
and Section 4975 of the Code for certain transactions, provided that neither the Issuer nor any of its
affiliates (directly or indirectly) have or exercise any discretionary authority or control or render any
investment advice with respect to the assets of any Benefit Plan Investor involved in the transaction
and provided further that the Benefit Plan Investor receives no less, nor pays no more, than
adequate consideration in connection with the transaction. Each of the above-noted exemptions
contains conditions and limitations on its application. Fiduciaries of Benefit Plan Investors
considering acquiring and/or holding the notes in reliance on these or any other exemption should
carefully review the exemption to ensure it is applicable. There can be no assurance that all of the
conditions of any such exemptions will be satisfied.

As a general rule, a ‘‘governmental plan’’ (as defined in Section 3(32) of ERISA), a ‘‘church
plan’’ (as defined in Section 3(33) of ERISA) that has not made an election under Section 410(d) of
the Code and a ‘‘non-U.S. plan’’ (defined as any plan maintained outside the United States
primarily for the benefit of persons substantially all of whom are nonresident aliens) are not subject
to Title I of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code. Accordingly, assets of such plans may be invested
without regard to the fiduciary and prohibited transaction considerations described above. However,

264

while such plans are not subject to Title I of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, each such plan
may be subject to other applicable Similar Laws. A fiduciary of any such plan should therefore
consider whether investing in the notes satisfies the requirements, if any, under all applicable
Similar Laws.

Because of the foregoing, the notes should not be purchased or held by any person investing
‘‘plan assets’’ of any Plan unless such purchase and holding will not constitute a non-exempt
prohibited transaction under ERISA or the Code or a similar violation of any applicable Similar
Laws.

**Representation**

Accordingly, by acceptance of a note, each purchaser and subsequent transferee of a note
will be deemed to have represented and warranted that either (a) it is not a Plan, or (b)(i) its
acquisition, holding and disposition of the notes will not constitute a non-exempt prohibited
transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or a similar violation of
applicable Similar Law and (ii) if it is a Benefit Plan Investor, the decision to purchase the notes has
been made by a Plan Fiduciary who is independent of the Transaction Parties, which Plan Fiduciary
(A) is a fiduciary under ERISA or the Code, or both, with respect to the decision to purchase the
notes, (B) is not an IRA owner (in the case of an IRA), (C) is capable of evaluating investment risks
independently, both in general and with regard to the prospective investment in the notes, (D) has
exercised independent judgment in evaluating whether to invest the assets of such Benefit Plan
Investor in the notes and (E) is either a bank, an insurance carrier, a registered investment adviser,
a registered broker-dealer or an independent fiduciary with at least $50 million of assets under
management or control as specified in 29 C.F.R. Section 2510.3-21(c)(1)(i).

The foregoing discussion is general in nature and is not intended to be all inclusive nor
should it be construed as legal advice. Due to the complexity of these rules and the penalties that
may be imposed upon persons involved in non-exempt prohibited transactions, it is particularly
important that fiduciaries, or other persons considering purchasing the notes on behalf of, or with
the assets of, any Plan, consult with their counsel regarding the potential applicability of ERISA,
Section 4975 of the Code and any Similar Laws to such investment and whether an exemption
would be applicable to the purchase and holding of the notes. Purchasers have exclusive
responsibility for ensuring that their purchase and holding of the notes do not violate the fiduciary
responsibility or prohibited transaction rules of ERISA, the Code, or any applicable Similar Laws.
Except as otherwise stated herein, the sale of any notes to a Plan is in no respect a representation
by the Issuer, an initial purchaser, or any of their respective affiliates or representatives that such an
investment meets all legal requirements with respect to such investments by any such Plan
generally or any other particular Plan, or that such investment is appropriate for such Plan generally
or for any other particular Plan.

**LIMITATIONS ON THE ENFORCEABILITY OF GUARANTEES AND CERTAIN INSOLVENCY**
**CONSIDERATIONS**

**European Union**

The Issuer and certain of the guarantors are organized under the laws of member states (the
‘‘Member States’’) of the EU.

Pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) no. 1346/2000 on insolvency proceedings, as amended
(the ‘‘EU Insolvency Regulation’’), which applies within the EU, other than Denmark, the courts of
the Member State in which a company’s ‘‘centre of main interests’’ (as that term is used in
Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation) is situated have jurisdiction to open main insolvency
proceedings. The determination of where a company has its ‘‘centre of main interests’’ is a question
of fact on which the courts of the different Member States may have differing and even conflicting
views.

Although there is a rebuttable presumption under Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation
that a company has its ‘‘centre of main interests’’ in the Member State in which it has its registered
office in the absence of proof to the contrary, Preamble 13 of the EU Insolvency Regulation states
that the ‘‘centre of main interests’’ of a ‘‘debtor should correspond to the place where the debtor
conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and is therefore ascertainable by third
parties’’.

The European Court of Justice has ruled that ‘‘a debtor company’s main centre of interests
must be determined by attaching greater importance to the place of the company’s central
administration, as may be established by objective factors which are ascertainable by third parties.
Where the bodies responsible for the management and supervision of a company are in the same
place as its registered office and the management decisions of the company are taken, in a manner
that is ascertainable by third parties, in that place, the presumption, that the centre of the
company’s main interests is located in that place, shall be non-rebuttable. Where a company’s
central administration is, however, not in the same place as its registered office, the presence of
company assets and existence of contracts for the financial exploitation of those assets in a
Member State other than that in which the registered office is situated cannot be regarded as
sufficient factors to rebut the abovementioned presumption unless a comprehensive assessment of
all relevant factors makes it possible to establish, in a manner that is ascertainable by third parties,
that the company’s actual center of management and supervision and of the management of its
interests is located in that other Member State’’. The factors to be taken into account include, in
particular, all the places in which the debtor company pursues economic activities and all those in
which it holds assets, in so far as they are ascertainable by third parties. A company’s ‘‘centre of
main interests’’ may change from time to time but is determined for the purposes of deciding which
courts have competent jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings at the time of the request to
open or initiate those proceedings.

The EU Insolvency Regulation applies to insolvency proceedings which are collective
insolvency proceedings of the types referred to in Annex A to the EU Insolvency Regulation. If the
‘‘centre of main interests’’ of a company is located in the Member State in which it has its
registered office, the main insolvency proceedings in respect of such company under the EU
Insolvency Regulation would be commenced in such jurisdiction and accordingly a court in such
jurisdiction would be entitled to commence the types of insolvency proceedings referred to in
Annex A to the EU Insolvency Regulation. Insolvency proceedings opened in one Member State
under the EU Insolvency Regulation are to be recognized in the other Member States (other than
Denmark), although secondary ‘‘territorial’’ proceedings may be opened in another Member State.

266


-----

If the ‘‘centre of main interests’’ of a company is in one Member State (other than Denmark)
under Article 3(2) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another Member State (other than
Denmark) have jurisdiction to open ‘‘territorial proceedings’’ against that company only if such
company has an ‘‘establishment’’ in the territory of such other Member State. An ‘‘establishment’’ is
defined to mean a place of operations where the company carries on non-transitory economic
activity with human means and goods. The effects of those territorial proceedings opened in that
other Member State are restricted to the assets of the company situated in such other Member
State.

Where main proceedings have been opened in the Member State in which the company has
its ‘‘centre of main interests’’, any proceedings opened subsequently in another Member State in
which the company has an establishment (territorial proceedings) are limited to ‘‘winding up
proceedings’’ listed in Annex B of the EU Insolvency Regulation. Where main proceedings in the
Member State in which the company has its ‘‘centre of main interests’’ have not yet been opened,
territorial proceedings can only be opened in another Member State where the company has an
establishment where either (a) insolvency proceedings cannot be opened in the Member State in
which the company’s ‘‘centre of main interests’’ is situated under that Member State’s law; or
(b) the territorial proceedings are opened at the request of a creditor which is domiciled, habitually
resident or has its registered office in the other Member State or whose claim arises from the
operation of the establishment. Irrespective of whether the insolvency proceedings are main or
territorial proceedings, such proceedings will always, subject to certain exemptions, be governed by
the local insolvency law of the court which has assumed jurisdiction for the insolvency proceedings
of the debtor.

The courts of all Member States (other than Denmark) must recognize the judgement of the
court opening main proceedings which will be given the same effect in the other Member States so
long as no territorial proceedings have been opened there. The liquidator appointed by a court in a
Member State which has jurisdiction to open main proceedings (because the company’s ‘‘centre of
main interests’’ is there) may exercise the powers conferred on him by the law of that Member
State in another Member State (such as to remove assets of the company from that other Member
State) subject to certain limitations so long as no insolvency proceedings have been opened in that
other Member State or any preservation measures have been taken to the contrary further to a
request to open insolvency proceedings in that other Member State where the company has assets.

On 20 May 2015, the European Parliament adopted the regulation of the Council of the EU
amending the EU Insolvency Regulation. The text of the regulation appeared in the Official Journal
on 5 June 2015 (OJ L 141/19) and the amended EU Insolvency Regulation (the ‘‘Recast
Regulation’’) entered into force on 26 June 2015. The Recast Regulation applies (except for certain
provision) to insolvency proceedings opened from 26 June 2017. In the interim the provisions of the
existing EU Insolvency Regulation shall continue to apply. The Recast Regulation has direct effect in
each EU Member State (except for Denmark) without the need for separate enactment at a national
level. Prospective investors should consult their own legal advisors with respect to the potential
impact of the Recast Regulation on any investment in this transaction (without limitation to their
need to seek legal advice on this transaction more broadly).

**The Netherlands**

**_Insolvency Law_**

The Issuer and certain guarantors (the ‘‘Dutch guarantors’’) are incorporated in the
Netherlands and are presumed to have their centre of main interest in the Netherlands.
Consequently, in the event of an insolvency of the Issuer or any Dutch guarantor, insolvency

267


-----

proceedings are likely to be initiated in the Netherlands. Such proceedings would then be governed
by Dutch law.

There are two applicable corporate insolvency regimes under Dutch law: (a) suspension of
payments (surseance van betaling), which is intended to facilitate the reorganization of a debtor’s
debts and enable the debtor to continue as a going concern, and (b) bankruptcy (faillissement),
which is primarily designed to liquidate and distribute the debtor’s assets to its creditors.

Application for suspension of payments (or ‘‘moratorium’’) can only be made by the debtor,
and only if it foresees that it will be unable to continue payments when they fall due and could be
used as a defense by the debtor against a bankruptcy application by a creditor. Once the
application has been filed, a court will immediately (dadelijk) grant a provisional suspension of
payments and appoint one or more administrators (bewindvoerders).

A meeting of creditors is required to decide on the definitive moratorium. The court will grant a
definitive moratorium, unless a qualified minority (i.e., more than one-quarter of the amount of
claims held by creditors represented at the creditors’ meeting or more than one-third of the number
of creditors of the amount of claims held by creditors) of the unsecured, non-preferential, creditors
is opposed or if there is a valid fear that the debtor will try to prejudice the creditors during a
moratorium or if there is no prospect that the debtor will be able to satisfy its creditors in the (near)
future. A moratorium will only affect unsecured, non- preferential creditors.

Under Dutch law, a debtor can be declared bankrupt when it has ceased to pay its debts.
Bankruptcy can be requested by a creditor of a claim when there is at least one other creditor. At
least one of the claims (of the creditor requesting bankruptcy or the other creditor) needs to be due
and payable. The debtor can also request the application of bankruptcy proceedings itself.
Furthermore, the Public Prosecution Service (het Openbaar Ministerie) can request the application
of bankruptcy proceedings for reasons of public interest (openbaar belang). In Dutch bankruptcy
proceedings, a debtor’s assets would generally be liquidated and the proceeds distributed to the
debtor’s creditors according to the relative priority of those creditors’ claims and, to the extent
certain creditors’ claims have equal priority, in proportion to the amount of such claims. Certain
parties, such as secured creditors, will benefit from special rights. Secured creditors, such as
pledgees and mortgagees, may enforce their rights separately from suspension of payments or
bankruptcy and do not have to contribute to the liquidation costs; however, enforcement of the
security interest might be subject to the following: (a) a statutory stay of execution of up to two
months extendable by another period of up to two months imposed by court order pursuant to
articles 63a of the Dutch Bankruptcy Act (Faillissementswet); (b) a liquidator (curator) may force a
secured creditor to enforce its security interest within a reasonable period of time, failing which the
liquidator will be entitled to sell the secured assets, if any, and the secured creditor will have a
preferred claim in respect of the proceeds, meaning that the secured creditor will have to share in
the bankruptcy costs, which may be significant or force a secured party to foreclose its security
interest within a reasonable time (as determined by the liquidator pursuant to Article 58(1) of the
Dutch Bankruptcy Act), failing which the liquidator will be entitled to sell the relevant rights or assets
and distribute the proceeds to the secured party after a deduction of liquidation costs; and
(c) excess proceeds of enforcement must be returned to the company’s liquidator and may not be
offset against an unsecured claim of the company’s secured creditor.

Unlike Chapter 11 proceedings under U.S. bankruptcy law, where both secured and
unsecured creditors are generally barred from seeking to recover on their claims, moratorium and
bankruptcy proceedings allow secured creditors (and in case of moratorium also preferential
creditors (including tax and social security authorities)) to satisfy their claims by proceeding against
the assets (that secure their claims) as if there were no bankruptcy or moratorium. However, a
statutory stay of execution of up to two months, extendable by another period of up to two months,

268


-----

may be declared applicable. Furthermore, certain preferred creditors have a preference by virtue of
law. Unlike secured creditors, preferred creditors are not entitled to foreclose on assets of the
bankrupt company. They do have priority in the distribution of the proceeds of the bankrupt
company’s assets.

Any pending executions of judgments against the debtor will be suspended by operation of
law when suspension of payments is granted and terminate by operation of law when bankruptcy is
declared. In addition, all attachments on the debtor’s assets will cease to have effect upon the
suspension of payments having become definitive, a composition having been ratified by the court
or the declaration of bankruptcy (as the case may be) subject to the ability of the court to set an
earlier date for such termination. Litigation pending on the date of the bankruptcy order is
automatically stayed.

Both in a definitive suspension of payments and bankruptcy, a composition (akkoord) may be
offered to creditors. A composition will be binding for all unsecured and non-preferential creditors if
it is: (i) approved by a simple majority (gewone meerderheid) of the number of creditors
represented at the creditors’ meeting, representing at least 50% of the amount of the claims that
are acknowledged and conditionally admitted, and (ii) subsequently ratified (gehomologeerd) by the
court. Consequently, Dutch insolvency law could preclude or inhibit the ability of the holders of the
notes to effect a restructuring and could reduce the recovery of a holder of notes in a Dutch
suspension of payments proceeding or bankruptcy. Interest accruing after the date on which a
suspension of payments or bankruptcy is granted, cannot be claimed in a composition. All
unsecured, pre-bankruptcy claims will have to be verified in the insolvency proceedings in order to
be entitled to vote and, in a bankruptcy liquidation, to be entitled to distributions. ‘‘Verification’’
under Dutch law means, in the case of a suspension of payments, that the treatment of a disputed
claim for voting purposes is determined and, in the case of a bankruptcy, the unsecured, prebankruptcy claims are submitted to a liquidator for verification, and the liquidator then makes a
determination as to the claim’s existence, ranking and value and whether and to what extent it
should be admitted in the bankruptcy proceedings (for voting). In the situation of bankruptcy,
creditors that wish to dispute the liquidator’s verification of their claims will be referred to a claim
validation proceeding (renvooiprocedure) in order to establish the amount and rank of the disputed
claim, while in suspension of payments the court will decide how a disputed claim will be treated
for voting purposes. Interest on the notes accruing after the bankruptcy order date cannot be
admitted unless secured by a pledge or mortgage, in which case interest will be admitted pro
memoria. To the extent that any interest is not covered by the proceeds of the security, the creditor
may not derive any rights from the admission. No interest is payable in respect of unsecured claims
as of the date of a bankruptcy.

_Limitations on guarantees and security interests_

Under Dutch law, the obligations of the Issuer and the Dutch guarantors may be affected by
(a) the standards of reasonableness and fairness (maatstaven van redelijkheid en billijkheid);
(b) force majeure (niet-toerekenbare tekortkoming) and unforeseen circumstances (onvoorziene
_omstandigheden); and (c) the other general defenses available to debtors under Dutch law in_
respect of the validity, binding effect and enforceability of the notes. Other general defenses include
claims that a security interest should be avoided because it was entered into through undue
influence (misbruik van omstandigheden), fraud (bedrog), duress (bedreiging) or error (dwaling).
Other impeding factors include dissolution of contract (ontbinding) and set-off (verrekening).

A corporate resolution approving the issuance of a guarantee granted by a Dutch company
may be suspended or voided by the Enterprise Chamber of the Court of Appeal in Amsterdam
(Ondernemingskamer van het Gerechtshof te Amsterdam) on the motion of the holder or holders of
shares or depository receipts issued for shares in such company who, solely or jointly, represent at

269


-----

least one tenth of the issued capital in such company or shares or depositary receipts issued
therefore with a nominal value of e225,000 or such lesser amount as provided in the company’s
articles of association. If the company has an issued share capital of at least e22.5 million, such
motion may be made by a holder or holders of 1% or more of the shares in such company or,
provided those are listed on a qualifying trading venue, shares or depositary receipts issued
therefor with a value of e20 million or more or such lesser amount as provided in the company’s
articles of association. The right to file such motion is further vested in an association of employees
which has amongst its members person working for the enterprise and which has at least two years
full legal capacity, and, for reasons of public interest, the advocate general at the Court of Appeals
in Amsterdam. Guarantee or security itself may further be upheld by the Enterprise Chamber, yet
actual payment under it may be suspended or voided.

Under Dutch law, any creditor of the Issuer or a Dutch guarantor or each of its liquidator
(curator) may nullify the issuance of the notes or the grant of the guarantees, or any other
transaction or legal act entered into by the Issuer or a Dutch guarantor in connection with the
notes, under certain circumstances, if (i) the issuance of the notes, any other transaction or legal
act entered into by the Issuer or a Dutch guarantor in connection with the notes was conducted
without prior existing legal obligation to do so (onverplicht), (ii) the creditor(s) concerned or, in the
case of its/their bankruptcy, any creditor was prejudiced as a consequence of such transactions or
legal act (irrespective of whether a creditor’s claim arose prior to or after such transactions) and
(iii) at the time of the issuance of the notes, or any other transaction or legal act entered into by the
Issuer or a Dutch guarantor in connection with the notes was conducted, the Issuer or the Dutch
guarantors and, unless the transactions were conducted for no consideration (om niet), the
counterparty knew or should have known that one or more of the entities’ creditors (existing or
future) would be prejudiced (actio pauliana). A liquidator (curator) may nullify a transaction on
behalf of and for the benefit of the joint insolvent debtor’s creditors, and the burden of proof of the
abovementioned elements of fraudulent conveyance in principle rests on the liquidator. Knowledge
of prejudice is however presumed by law for certain transactions performed within a ‘‘suspect
period’’ of one year prior to an adjudication of bankruptcy.

The foregoing requirements for invoking fraudulent transfer provisions outside of a bankruptcy
apply mutatis mutandis when invoking fraudulent transfer provisions during a bankruptcy. In
addition, the liquidator may challenge a transaction if it was conducted on the basis of a prior
existing legal obligation to do so (verplichte rechtshandeling), if (i) the transaction was conducted at
a time when the counterparty knew that a request for bankruptcy had been filed, or (ii) if such
transaction was conducted as a result of deliberation between the debtor and the counterparty with
a view to giving preference to the counterparty over the debtor’s other creditors. Consequently, the
validity of any such transactions conducted by a Dutch legal entity may be challenged and it is
possible that such challenge would be successful.

**_Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of Guarantees_**

The validity and enforceability of the guarantees of the Dutch guarantors incorporated in the
Netherlands may be successfully contested by such Dutch guarantors (or their respective
administrator in suspension of payments, or a receiver of such guarantors in bankruptcy) on the
basis of an ultra vires claim or other defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally, including
without limitation fraudulent conveyance and voidable preference. An ultra vires claim may be
successful if both (i) the obligations of the relevant Dutch guarantor do not fall within the scope of
the purpose clause set forth in the company’s articles of association and (ii) the counterparty of
such Dutch guarantor knew or ought to have known (without inquiry) that the transaction was not
within such scope. In determining whether a transaction is in furtherance of the corporate purpose
of a Dutch company, a court will consider (i) the text of the purpose clause in the company’s

270


-----

articles of association; (ii) whether the granting of such security interest is in the company’s
corporate interests and to its benefit; and (iii) whether the company’s subsistence is jeopardized by
the relevant transaction. The mere fact that a certain legal act is explicitly reflected in a Dutch
company’s purpose clause may not be conclusive evidence that such legal act is not ultra vires.

**Australia**

**_Certain Insolvency Considerations_**

As one of the guarantors is located in Australia, proceedings may be commenced in Australia
against this entity should either of them become insolvent. Insolvency proceedings in Australia can
take a number of forms, the most relevant for the holders of notes being the voluntary
administration and liquidation processes. The law relating to these proceedings is complex and
detailed. The following is only a brief summary of its key features which are likely to be relevant to
holders of notes.

One further procedure which could occur is provisional liquidation, in which the Australian
courts can appoint an independent office holder to take control of the company with powers similar
to a liquidator. For the purposes of this document, provisional liquidation would have a substantially
similar effect on the company as liquidation, so the procedure is not separately outlined here.
Accordingly, references in this document to a liquidator can be considered to include a provisional
liquidator, except where specifically stated.

Under Australian law, a company will be insolvent if it is unable to pay its debts as and when
they become due and payable. Australian courts have held that this is a question of fact which
involves consideration of the company’s financial position as a whole, taking into account
commercial realities.

_Voluntary Administration_

The voluntary administration process in Australia is governed by Part 5.3A of the Corporations
Act 2001 of Australia (the ‘‘Australian Corporations Act’’). Voluntary administration is an out-of-court
insolvency procedure that can be initiated by the directors of a company, a secured creditor who is
entitled to enforce a security interest over the whole, or substantially the whole, of the property of
the company, or if the company is already in liquidation, by its liquidator.

Outside the voluntary administration procedure, Australian law imposes a strict duty on
directors of a company to prevent insolvent trading. For directors, failure to prevent insolvent
trading carries with it a risk of personal liability under section 588G of the Australian Corporations
Act, which if established can result in civil and criminal penalties. If a company is found to have
traded whilst insolvent, directors can be personally liable for debts incurred by the company whilst
the company was insolvent. Upon the appointment of a voluntary administrator, the directors cease
to control the company and their liability for future trading ceases (although liability continues in
respect of trading prior to the administrators’ appointment). Accordingly, voluntary administration
can be described as a ‘‘safe harbor’’ for directors and, as a result, is a step commonly taken by
directors where they become concerned that a company may be insolvent or is likely to become
insolvent in future.

The procedure involves the appointment of an administrator to a company that is, or is likely
to become, insolvent. It is a temporary process in the sense that it is not an end in itself. Rather, the
administrator assumes management of the company’s business, property and affairs (the directors’
powers being suspended) for a short time with a view to either:

   - maximizing the chances of the company, or its business, remaining in existence; or

271


-----

   - if it is not possible for the company or its business to remain in existence — to result in a
better return for the company’s creditors and members than would result if the company
were to enter liquidation.

Once an administrator has been appointed, the administrator must investigate the company’s
business, property, affairs and financial circumstances (and the directors are required to assist the
administrator in doing this). Two meetings of creditors are held. The first is held within 8 business
days of the administrators’ appointment. The purpose of that meeting is largely to confirm the
appointment of the administrator, or to enable creditors to resolve to replace that administrator.

The second meeting is held within 20 business days of the administrators’ appointment. If the
administration occurs during the Christmas or Easter holiday period, the period is 25 business
days. Prior to the second meeting, the administrator must formulate an opinion as to whether the
administration should end (thus returning the company to the directors, for example because the
company can continue to trade on a solvent basis), the company should be subject to a deed of
company arrangement (in essence, a contract that binds all creditors and seeks to restructure/
rehabilitate the company), or the company should be wound up, and report to creditors. At the
second meeting, creditors may resolve on one of those three outcomes by a simple majority
resolution. The capacity to vote on the resolution gives creditors a significant measure of control
over the outcome of the voluntary administration procedure, in particular whether a deed of
company arrangement is approved or whether the company goes into liquidation.

During the voluntary administration procedure, a statutory moratorium is imposed which
prevents the enforcement of security interests against the company and its assets. There are
exceptions to the moratorium which apply if the relevant security interest has been perfected within
the meaning of the Personal Property Securities Act 2009 of Australia. In particular, a creditor that
holds a security interest over the whole, or substantially the whole, of the property of the company
is permitted to enforce its security interest within the 13 business day period from the
commencement of the administration. It is common for secured lenders to take security over the
whole or substantially the whole of the property of Australian companies to avail themselves of this
exception.

_Liquidation/Winding Up_

In Australia, company liquidations can commence voluntarily (by resolution of the company’s
members, if the company is solvent) or by court order (on the application of the company, a
creditor, a contributory, a director, a liquidator or provisional liquidator or certain regulatory bodies).

Once a liquidator has been appointed, the liquidator takes control of the company’s affairs.
The liquidator has similar powers as a voluntary administrator to carry on and conduct the
company’s business. However, the liquidator can exercise those powers only to the beneficial
conduct of the winding-up of the company. The approval of creditors or the court is also required
for the liquidator to enter into certain contracts on the company’s behalf, including those with
obligations or arrangements that endure longer than 3 months.

The liquidator also has powers and duties to investigate the conduct of the company’s
business and affairs prior to the liquidation. Investigations include transactions entered into by the
company, the conduct of its directors and officers. Other functions and powers of the liquidator
include gathering in the assets of the company, discharging its liabilities and distributing the
remaining assets in accordance with the statutory priority regime set out in the Australian
Corporations Act. Throughout the course of the liquidation the directors’ powers cease and, once
the liquidation is finalized, the company is ultimately deregistered and dissolved.

272


-----

**_Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of Guarantees_**

The Australian Corporations Act provides for a number of grounds under which a liquidator
may apply to the Court for a declaration that a guarantee granted by the company in the lead up to
its insolvency be deemed void. A brief summary of the types of transactions that can be deemed
voidable (and therefore ‘‘clawed back’’ by a liquidator) include:

   - Unfair Preference — this is a transaction between the company and the creditor that results
in the creditor receiving from the company, in respect of an unsecured debt, more than the
creditor would receive on a winding up of the company. A guarantee could be declared void
(and therefore reversed) if a liquidator establishes to a Court that:

      - it is an unfair preference;

     - it was granted (or an act was done to give effect to it) when the company was
insolvent (or the company became insolvent as a result of entry into (or giving effect
to) the transaction); and

      - it was granted into during the 6 months prior to the liquidators’ appointment.

   - Uncommercial Transaction — this is a transaction of a company that a reasonable person in
the company’s position would not have entered into, having regard to the benefits and
detriment to the company, the benefits to the other parties to the transaction and any other
matters the Court considers relevant. A guarantee could be declared void if a liquidator
establishes to a Court that:

      - it is an uncommercial transaction;

     - it was granted (or an act was done to give effect to it) when the company was
insolvent (or the company became insolvent as a result of entry into (or giving effect
to) the transaction); and

      - it was granted during the 2 years prior to the liquidators’ appointment.

   - Transaction to Defeat, Delay or Interfere with the Rights of Creditors — a liquidator could
also seek to set aside a guarantee if it established to a Court that:

     - the company granted the guarantee for the purpose, or for purposes including the
purpose, of defeating, delaying, or interfering with, the rights of any or all of its
creditors on a winding up of the company;

     - the guarantee was granted (or an act was done to give effect to it) when the company
was insolvent (or the company became insolvent as a result of entry into (or giving
effect to) the transaction); and

      - the guarantee was granted during the 10 years prior to the liquidators’ appointment.

**Austria**

Diversey Austria Trading GmbH is incorporated in the form of an Austrian company with
limited liability (Gesellschaft mit beschr¨ankter Haftung). Consequently, the granting of guarantees as
well as the assumption of certain obligations of other group companies by it is subject to certain
mandatory Austrian capital maintenance rules (‘‘Austrian Capital Maintenance Rules’’), including,
without limitation, section 82 et seq. of the Austrian Act on Limited Liability (Gesetz ¨uber
_Gesellschaften mit beschr¨ankter Haftung)._

273


-----

Rights of holders of notes might also be affected by the Austrian Business Reorganisation Act
(Unternehmensreorganisationsgesetz), which does not govern insolvency proceedings but regulates
the reorganization of companies in financial distress.

The Austrian Insolvency Act regulates on the one hand liquidation proceedings in which the
debtor’s assets or company as a whole are sold and the proceeds are distributed among its
creditors. On the other hand it also provides for restructuring proceedings enabling the debtor to
discharge its liabilities through quota payments and to continue its activities under certain
conditions.

The Business Reorganization Act, which regulates reorganization proceedings for enterprises
threatened by insolvency, is not designed to assist creditors in satisfying their debts, but rather to
support the reorganization of the debtor’s enterprise. The insolvency laws of Austria may not be as
favorable to your interests as creditors as the insolvency laws of other jurisdictions including in
respect of priority of creditors’ claims, the ability to obtain post-petition interest and the duration of
the insolvency proceedings. As a result, your ability to recover payments due on the notes may be
limited to an extent exceeding the limitations arising under other insolvency laws.

In the event of insolvency of a guarantor organized under the laws of Austria and/or having its
centre of main interests in Austria at the time the application for the opening of insolvency
proceedings is filed, Austrian insolvency law would most likely govern such proceedings.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of the insolvency laws of Austria.

_Austrian Insolvency Proceedings_

In respect of the insolvency of companies, the Austrian Insolvency Act provides the legal
framework for three forms of insolvency proceedings (actually one uniform proceeding with three
names depending on the procedural route taken):

   - bankruptcy proceedings (Konkursverfahren), for which a bankruptcy administrator
(Masseverwalter) is appointed;

   - restructuring proceedings without self-administration (Sanierungsverfahren ohne
_Eigenverwaltung), for which a bankruptcy administrator is also appointed and in which a few_
provisions differ from those for a bankruptcy proceedings; and

   - restructuring proceedings with self-administration (Sanierungsverfahren unter
_Eigenverwaltung), which are designed as a special form of restructuring proceedings and for_
which a restructuring administrator (Sanierungsverwalter) is appointed to monitor the
activities of the debtor. In such case, certain transactions are either subject to the
restructuring administrator’s approval or may be performed only by the restructuring
administrator.

While bankruptcy proceedings aim at the debtor’s liquidation (the sale of the whole insolvency
estate and distribution of sales proceeds), restructuring proceedings aim at the preservation of the
debtor as a going concern. To that end, a restructuring plan (Sanierungsplan) must be prepared by
the debtor and presented to its unsecured creditors for approval. Such restructuring plan presented
in the course of restructuring proceedings with self-administration must offer satisfaction of all
preferred claims and at least 30% of the insolvency claims payable within two years. In case of a
restructuring plan to be adopted in the course of restructuring proceedings without
self-administration, the minimum quota is lowered to 20%.

If the adopted restructuring plan is fulfilled, the debtor is discharged of all its past debts.

-----

A debtor is deemed insolvent if one or both of the following applies: (i) if it is illiquid, i.e. it is
unable to pay its debts as and when they fall due and payable, provided that such payment delay
is not only temporary where there is a high probability that liquid funds will be available in the near
future (the cash flow test). Courts allow the debtor a grace period, which (depending on the court)
may take up to three months to overcome its payment delays before they consider the debtor
illiquid; and/or (ii) if the debtor is over-indebted, i.e. liabilities on the debtor’s balance sheet exceed
the assets, in the presence of a negative going concern forecast (negative Fortbestandsprognose)
(the balance sheet test). Insolvency proceedings (Insolvenzverfahren) must be opened by a court in
the event that the debtor is insolvent.

The effective date of insolvency is the date on which the debtor is, as a matter of fact,
insolvent. The effective date is crucial with respect to a number of issues, including managing
directors’ obligation to file for the opening of insolvency proceedings and the beginning of
hardening periods.

The debtor is obliged, ‘‘without culpable delay’’, to apply for the opening of insolvency
proceedings no later than 60 days after the insolvency effective date. During this 60-day period, the
managing directors may make reasonable efforts to prepare for a filing of restructuring proceedings
or agree with the creditors on an out-of court settlement. Typically, the insolvency proceedings are
opened immediately upon application by the debtor. Further, in the case that a debtor is at
imminent risk of being unable to pay its debts when they fall due (drohende Zahlungsunf¨ahigkeit),
the debtor may (but is not obliged to) apply for the opening of restructuring proceedings. A creditor
may also file for the opening of insolvency proceedings but will have to demonstrate that the debtor
is insolvent or over-indebted. In the case of an imminent risk of insolvency, a creditor may, however,
not initiate the opening of insolvency proceedings.

The initiation of insolvency proceedings brings about substantive and procedural law effects
as of the beginning of the day (0:00 a.m.) that follows the publication of the court’s order to open
such proceedings in the official online insolvency data base (www.edikte.justiz.gv.at). As of this point
in time, the managing directors lose the power to dispose over the insolvency estate — except in
respect to legal acts in the course of ordinary business undertaken in restructuring proceedings
with self-administration — and legal acts by the managing directors performed thereafter are
ineffective as far as the creditors are concerned. In particular, the following are the most important
effects:

Contracts may be terminated. As a general rule, bilateral agreements are not automatically
terminated in case of the opening of insolvency proceedings. However, in a case where a bilateral
agreement has not been fully fulfilled by both the debtor and the other party to such agreement,
the insolvency administrator has the choice whether to continue and fulfil such agreement or to
prematurely terminate such agreement within a certain time period to be set by the court upon
application of one of the parties.

Further, any appointment as a legal representative (Vollmachtsnehmer) or as an agent
(Auftragnehmer) granted by a debtor will cease to be valid upon the opening of insolvency
proceedings over its assets.

Additionally, the insolvency administrator has certain preferential rights to terminate
employment contracts in case the debtor’s enterprise or a part thereof is closed or downsized
during insolvency proceedings.

A debtor’s contractual partner must not terminate contracts concluded with the debtor for a
period of six months if such termination could endanger the continuation of the debtor’s business.

275


-----

Pursuant to section 25b para 2 of the Austrian Insolvency Act, generally a contractual
stipulation providing for the right to withdraw from the agreement or for an automatic termination in
the event of opening of insolvency proceedings (Insolvenzverfahren) against the other party is not
enforceable by the debtor’s contractual partner. There are certain limited exemptions to this rule.

Any individual enforcement action brought against the debtor’s assets by any of its unsecured
creditors is subject to an automatic stay upon the opening of insolvency proceedings.

The title owner (Eigent¨umer) or the economic owner (in case of a trust relationship
(Treuhandschaft)) of an asset in the possession of the debtor at the time of the opening of
insolvency proceedings has a right of separation (Aussonderungsrecht) with regard to its assets.
Such separation assets (Aussonderungsgut) do not form part of the insolvency estate
(Insolvenzmasse) and the relevant creditor can (subject to a six-month stay as described below)
require the surrender of its separation assets. During a period of six months after the opening of
insolvency proceedings, the owners’ claims for surrender of its separation asset are stayed (that is
a legal respite becomes effective) if such surrender would endanger the continuation of the
business conduct of the debtor provided that, among other things, such stay does not cause a
severe personal or economic harm to the owner.

Creditor’s rights secured by a right in rem over the debtor’s assets or any part thereof (for
example, by a mortgage or pledge over bank accounts, receivables, movables) are not affected by
the opening of insolvency proceedings. This, however, requires prior perfection of the establishment
of the security interest (subject to a six-month stay as described below). Such secured creditors
have a right of preferential satisfaction (Absonderungsrecht) with regard to charged assets
(Absonderungsgut) and are as such entitled to satisfy their claims out of the enforcement proceeds
with regard to such charged assets. To the extent the net enforcement proceeds exceed the
amount of secured claims, the excess proceeds are distributed to the unsecured creditors on a pro
_rata basis._

As is the case with the right to separation, the right of preferential satisfaction of a secured
creditor may be subject to a compulsory stay for a period of six months.

Secured creditors who are not only secured by a charged asset, but also have a direct claim
for payment against the debtor may participate with their claims which are not covered by the
charged asset in the pro rata distribution of the insolvency estate in a bankruptcy proceedings or in
the restructuring plan.

The rights of a secured creditor depend on the type of its right of preferential satisfaction. If no
compulsory stay applies or once the six month period has expired, the secured creditor can assert
its claim outside of insolvency proceedings in regular court. The proceeds from the realization serve
the preferred satisfaction of the secured claims.

A creditor is entitled to exercise its rights of set-off and netting in the course of insolvency
proceedings; however, leaving aside certain derivatives and other financial/treasury transactions,
such rights are restricted to claims that have been compensable at the time of the opening of
insolvency proceedings. A creditor’s claim that has not become due at the time of the opening of
insolvency proceedings, as well as a creditor’s claim that is subject to a condition, are
compensable by operation of law.

As a general rule, the debtor’s enterprise (as well as its assets) must not be sold in the course
of restructuring proceedings since restructuring proceedings aim at the preservation of the debtor
as a going concern. In contrast, bankruptcy proceedings aim at the liquidation of the debtor
through the sale of its assets.

276


-----

A bankruptcy administrator is only appointed upon the opening of bankruptcy proceedings
and restructuring proceedings without self-administration whereby the managing directors lose
control over the debtor. In case of restructuring proceedings with self-administration the managing
directors stay in control of the debtor; however, a restructuring administrator having a right to veto
certain transactions out of the ordinary business is appointed. Under the supervision of the
insolvency court and the creditors’ committee, the insolvency administrator is acting in the interest
of all creditors and its main functions are evaluating the merits of insolvency claims filed by
creditors; deciding on whether the debtor’s business may be continued; examining whether a
restructuring plan is in the common interest of all creditors; distribution of liquidation proceeds;
and, in case of a bankruptcy administrator, the management of the debtor’s business (for certain
transactions not part of the ordinary business, the consent of the creditors’ committee or insolvency
court is required).

As a general rule, the insolvency estate consists of all of the debtor’s assets with a monetary
value at the time of the opening of insolvency proceedings and all assets which have been
acquired during such proceedings.

_Voidance Rights_

In the event of insolvency proceedings, the insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) (in
case of restructuring proceedings with debtor’s asset management (Sanierungsverfahren unter
_Eigenverantwortung) the restructuring administrator (Sanierungsverwalter)) can contest legal actions_
and transactions which have taken place within certain suspective periods prior to the opening of
insolvency proceedings over the assets of the debtor (each such period referred to herein as a
‘‘hardening period’’) and which relate to the assets of the insolvent (illiquid or over-indebted) debtor,
provided that (i) the avoidance results in an increase of the insolvency estate
(Befriedigungstauglichkeit), (ii) the challenged legal action or transaction has caused a direct or
indirect discrimination of the other creditors (Gl¨aubigerbenachteiligung), (iii) one of the special
conditions outlined below is fulfilled and (iv) the avoidance claim is filed within one year after the
opening of the insolvency proceedings.

Legal acts (Rechtshandlungen) may be contested:

   - if they have caused disadvantage (Benachteiligung) to the creditors of the debtor, and

   - if the debtor’s intention to cause disadvantage must have been known (where slight
negligence (leichte Fahrl¨assigkeit) of the counterparty is sufficient) to the counterparty,

provided that such legal acts have been carried out during a hardening period of two years. If the
counterpart had actual knowledge of such intention to cause disadvantage, such hardening period
is extended to ten years.

In case the debtor and the counterpart are members of the same affiliated group, the burden
of proof is eased in favor of the contesting insolvency administrator since the respective creditor of
the debtor must prove that it did not know of the debtor’s intention to cause disadvantage to its
creditors.

The intention to cause disadvantage is fulfilled not only if the satisfaction of another creditor is
prevented but also when it is delayed or aggravated.

Purchase, barter and delivery agreements (Kauf-, Tausch- und Liefervertr¨age) may be
contested:

   - if they have caused disadvantage (Benachteiligung) to the creditors of the debtor; and

277


-----

   - if the debtor’s intention to fraudulently convey its assets
(Verm¨ogensverschleuderungsabsicht) (e.g., selling the purchased shares for an unusual and
unjustified low price) under such agreements must have been known to the counterpart,

provided that such agreements have been concluded during a hardening period of one year.

Transactions free of charge (unentgeltliche Verf¨ugungen) may be contested, provided that
such transactions have been concluded during a hardening period of two years.

If any of the following acts in relation to the providing of security interests or the satisfaction of
claims occurred 60 days prior to or after the debtor had become insolvent (illiquid or overindebted)
or insolvency proceedings had been opened over the debtor’s assets:

   - creditor has obtained a security interest regarding, or the satisfaction of, a claim to which
such creditor was not entitled to receive in this way or at this time except in case such
creditor has not been preferentially treated as compared to other creditors of the debtor; or

   - the debtor has provided a creditor with a security interest or satisfied a claim with the
intention to preferentially treat (Beg¨unstigungsabsicht) such creditor if such creditor knew or
must have known of the debtor’s intent to preferentially treat such creditors,

such legal acts of the debtor can be contested provided that such acts were undertaken within a
hardening period of one year.

If any of the following legal acts (Rechtshandlungen) were undertaken after the debtor had
become illiquid (zahlungsunf¨ahig) or insolvency proceedings had been open over the debtor’s
assets:

   - legal acts (Rechtshandlungen) providing a security interest to, or the satisfaction of, a claim
_vis-`a-vis an insolvency creditor and any legal transactions (Rechtsgesch¨afte) entered into by_
the debtor with any third party to the direct detriment (unmittelbarer Nachteil) of its other
creditors, if such third party counterpart knew or must have known of the debtor’s
insolvency (illiquidity or over-indebtedness) or the opening of insolvency proceedings; In
case the debtor and the counterpart are members of the same affiliated group, the burden
of proof is eased in favor of the contesting insolvency administrator since the respective
creditor of the debtor must prove that it did not know of the debtor’s insolvency; or

   - any legal transactions (Rechtsgesch¨afte) entered into by the debtor with any third party to
the indirect detriment (mittelbarer Nachteil) of its other creditors, if such third party
counterpart knew or must have known of the debtor’s insolvency (illiquidity or
over-indebtedness) or the opening of insolvency proceedings provided that the occurrence
of such detriment for the insolvency estate (Insolvenzmasse) was objectively foreseeable.
Such indirect detriment to other creditors is in particular foreseeable in the presence of an
unfit restructuring concept (offensichtlich untaugliches Restrukturierungskonzept),

such legal acts of the debtor can be contested provided that such legal acts (Rechtshandlungen)
were undertaken within a hardening period of six months.

Outside of insolvency proceedings, creditors can use the rights of contestation granted to
them by the Austrian Act on Avoidance of Legal Transactions (Anfechtungsordnung). However, this
act limits the right of contestation to transactions similar to those mentioned above of the Austrian
Insolvency Act.

The claim for contestation can be filed by any creditor whose claim against the debtor has not
been satisfied by the proceedings under the Austrian Enforcement Act (Exekutionsordnung) or is not
likely to be satisfied by such proceedings. The relevant point in time is not the formal opening of
insolvency proceedings, but the filing of the contestation claim with the competent court. The time

278


-----

period can be extended through notification procedure by the court. The rights of contestation
under the Austrian Act on Avoidance of Legal Transaction may be exercised by any creditor.

_The Austrian Business Reorganisation Act (Unternehmensreorganisationsgesetz)_

The Austrian Business Reorganisation Act (Unternehmensreorganisationsgesetz) governs
business reorganizations, which are designed to enable businesses in temporary financial distress
to continue to do business after having undergone a reorganization procedure. Only the debtor
may apply for the opening of a reorganization procedure, provided, however, that it is still solvent at
the time of its application. The relevant criteria for the opening of a business reorganization
procedure are the quota of own funds (Eigenmittelquote) of less than 8% and a fictitious duration of
debt redemption period (fiktive Schuldentilgungsdauer) of more than 15 years, each as defined in,
and determined in accordance with, the Business Reorganization Act. Failure to timely apply for the
opening of reorganization proceedings may result in personal liability of the representatives of the
relevant company. Pursuant to section 19 of the Austrian Business Reorganization Act, a contractual
stipulation providing for the right to withdraw from an agreement or for its automatic termination in
the event of the opening of reorganization proceedings relating to the other party is not
enforceable.

_Equity Replacement Law_

The Austrian Substitute Equity Act (Eigenkapitalersatz-Gesetz) contains detailed provisions
regarding equity replacing shareholder loans. It in particular stipulates that a loan granted by a
‘‘shareholder’’ to its subsidiary which is in a financial crisis (i.e., the subsidiary is insolvent,
over-indebted or the requirements of a business reorganization procedure are met, see above at
_The Austrian Business Reorganisation Act (Unternehmensreorganisationsgesetz)) is deemed to be_
recharacterized as equity. In a financial crisis such recharacterized shareholder loans (i.e., principal
amount and any interest accrued thereupon) may not be repaid and any security granted in
connection with such loans may not be enforced until the borrowing/guaranteeing subsidiary has
been reorganized or restructured. This means in particular that in an insolvency the respective
claims of the shareholder lender are subordinated (i.e., there is no right for separation
(Aussonderungsrecht) or a right for preferential satisfaction (Absonderungsrecht) for such claims). A
‘‘shareholder’’ is defined to be (i) a shareholder with controlling participation, (ii) a shareholder with
a participation of at least 25%, and (iii) any person not holding a participation in the company but
having a controlling influence (beherrschenden Einfluss) with regard to the company. Furthermore, a
person granting a loan/credit to a company is to be considered as ‘‘shareholder’’ if (i) it holds a
participation or other rights in a person other than the company receiving the loan/credit which has
a dominant (beherrschenden) influence regarding the company granted the loan/credit (indirect
controlling participation), or (ii) it indirectly holds a participation in the company receiving the loan/
credit of at least 33%, or (iii) it holds a controlling direct or indirect participation in a company which
holds a participation of at least 25% in the company receiving the loan/credit.

Prior to the enactment of the Austrian Substitute Equity Act, the Austrian Supreme Court had
developed even stricter rules on equity substituting shareholder loans. Following this, it is unclear
whether, in addition to the provisions of the Austrian Substitute Equity Act, such rules (or certain of
its rules) developed by the Austrian Supreme Court are still applicable/relevant and would be
applied by Austrian courts.

**_Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of Guarantees_**

_Capital Maintenance Rules_

Diversey Austria Trading GmbH is incorporated in the form of an Austrian company with
limited liability (Gesellschaft mit beschr¨ankter Haftung). Consequently, the granting of guarantees as
well as the assumption of certain obligations of other group companies by it is subject to certain
mandatory Austrian capital maintenance rules (‘‘Austrian Capital Maintenance Rules’’), including,
without limitation, section 82 et seq. of the Austrian Act on Limited Liability (Gesetz ¨uber
_Gesellschaften mit beschr¨ankter Haftung)._

Austrian Capital Maintenance Rules aim at preserving the capital of, among others, a company
with limited liability against unlawful distributions by such company to its shareholders. According to
Austrian Capital Maintenance Rules any direct or indirect distribution (a ‘‘Distribution’’) — i.e., the
entering into a business transaction that provides for any value transfer, including, but without
limitation, providing a guarantee or any other security interest — to a shareholder, including to a
third party upon request of a shareholder (e.g., to a holding company (up-stream) or a sister
company (side-stream)), without adequate consideration constitutes an unlawful repayment of
capital contributions (verbotene Einlagenr¨uckgew¨ahr) and, consequently, violates Austrian Capital
Maintenance Rules. Guarantees granted by an Austrian subsidiary in order to guarantee liabilities of
a direct or indirect parent or sister company are considered Distributions and may thus be held (in
whole or in part) invalid and unenforceable by Austrian courts if the granting of such guarantees
were not at arm’s length terms or for the Austrian subsidiary’s corporate benefit (see below).

A Distribution that does not provide for adequate consideration at first sight may, under certain
circumstances, not constitute a violation of the Austrian Capital Maintenance Rules if it is
‘‘commercially justified (betrieblich gerechtfertigt)’’. Generally, a Distribution is deemed commercially
justified (betrieblich gerechtfertigt) if a prudent business man (sorgf¨altig handelnder Gesch¨aftsleiter)
would have entered with an unrelated third party under the same circumstances into this particular
transaction and at the same terms (so called third party — or arm’s-length — test (Drittvergleich)).
This needs, however, to be evaluated on a case by case basis taking into account all particularities
of the respective transaction and based on the assessment of the overall benefit for the Austrian
company; such corporate benefit may be e.g. the receipt of monetary compensation or other
benefits received by the Austrian company which may result from the overall transaction. The
Austrian Supreme Court has not yet specified what exactly is meant by corporate benefit. As a
consequence, there always remains the risk that the assumption of an upstream/cross-stream
guarantee by an Austrian subsidiary violates the Austrian capital maintenance rules (due to a lack
of corporate benefit).

According to settled case law of the Austrian Supreme Court, unless an Austrian guarantor
receives adequate consideration for providing the upstream and/or cross stream guarantees, those
guarantees would be held to be null and void. The guarantee granted by an Austrian guarantor to
guarantee obligations of their direct or indirect parent companies or their sister companies may
only be held valid and enforceable if:

   - an Austrian guarantor receives a consideration (i.e., a guarantee fee (Avalprovision)) from
the benefiting parent company for assuming the guarantee;

   - such guarantee fee would also be common in comparable banking transactions
(bank¨ublich) (whereby it should be noted that the Austrian Supreme Court ruled that, in the
case of the granting of a mortgage over real property, the consideration must be
exceptionally high (ein ganz ungew¨ohnliches Entgelt), higher than is usual in the market; it is
unclear whether such ruling only applies to the granting of mortgages over real property or
also to the guarantees);

280


-----

   - the management board of the subsidiary has with due care verified that the subsidiary and
the parent are in a position to honor their obligations and finance the repayment of the
secured funds; and

   - the granting of the guarantee does not endanger the existence of the respective company.

Since the policy of granting guarantees by an Austrian guarantor is different from such policy
of a bank, the guarantee fee to be charged by an Austrian guarantor should be above the
guarantee fee a bank would charge in similar transactions.

Any transaction violating Austrian Capital Maintenance Rules may be held (in whole or in part)
null and void by Austrian courts. Consequently, any direct or indirect shareholder (side-stream or
up-stream) who has received any Distribution under such transaction may be liable to its Austrian
(direct or indirect) subsidiary for repayment of unlawfully received Distributions. The nullity may also
affect a third party (e.g., noteholders) if such third party knew or should have known (gross
_negligence) that the respective transaction was not permitted pursuant to Austrian capital_
maintenance rules.

Consequently, to the extent a guarantee is provided by an Austrian subsidiary to guarantee
liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company or any liability or obligation is assumed by
an Austrian subsidiary for the benefit of such parent or sister company, it is standard market
practice to include limitation language in the relevant transaction documents (e.g. indentures,
purchase agreements, guarantees etc.). Pursuant to such limitation language the scope of the
guarantee / assumption of liability, as far as the Austrian subsidiary is concerned is limited to the
extent permissible under Austrian Capital Maintenance Rules. No case law is available to confirm
and it is thus not certain whether these limitations would be valid and enforceable under Austrian
law and achieve the desired effect of legally preserving the guarantees to the extent possible or
whether the guarantees could be deemed void in their entirety.

Austrian Capital Maintenance Rules are subject to ongoing court decisions and it cannot be
ruled out that future court decisions may further limit the access of creditors and/or shareholders to
assets of Austrian subsidiaries, including, but without limitation, guarantees of guarantors organized
under Austrian laws, which could negatively affect our ability to make payment on the notes.

_Financial Assistance_

Although there is no explicit legal provision for Austrian limited liability companies under the
Austrian Limited Liability Act the risk that in the future the Austrian Supreme Court also applies the
prohibition of financial assistance (in acquiring its own shares) rules, which are explicitly stated for
Austrian stock corporations (section 66a Austrian Stock Corporation Act), also with respect to
Austrian limited liability companies, cannot be excluded. Austrian legal literature provides for
positions arguing for and against such application. However, an application of the prohibition of
financial assistance (in acquiring its own shares) rules would not result in the agreements being
void, but would lead to damage claims against the managing directors of the involved parties
(including the benefitting party). To avoid such liability risk, the limitation language mentioned above
will typically also limit the guarantee obligation of an Austrian guarantor to the effect that the
guarantee does not violate mandatory Austrian financial assistance rules.

_Banking Law Restrictions_

The Austrian Banking Act (Bankwesengesetz) enumerates certain banking activities which, if
conducted on a commercial basis (gewerblich) in Austria require a local Austrian banking license or
an appropriate license duly ‘‘passported’’ into Austria based on the European law
directive 2013/36/EU and covering such activities. In addition, the Austrian Securities Supervision

281


-----

Act 2007 (Wertpapieraufsichtsgesetz 2007), enumerates certain activities which qualify as investment
services and investment activities which, if conducted on a commercial basis (gewerblich) in Austria
require a local Austrian investment services license or an appropriate EU license duly ‘‘passported’’
into Austria based on the European law directive 2004/39/EC, as amended, and covering such
activities.

Besides any entity licensed by the Austrian supervisory authority to conduct regulated
activities within the meaning of the Banking Act and the Securities Supervisory Act credit institutions
or investment firms, respectively, authorized in a member state of the EEA, may conduct certain of
the regulated activities in Austria. Any such entity may conduct the relevant activities in Austria
either by the establishment of a branch office or by way of the freedom to provide services, insofar
as such activities are authorized under the legal provisions of the Member State of incorporation
and the relevant notification procedure in line with the European law directive 2013/26/EU or the
European law directive 2004/39/EC, respectively, and the relevant local laws have been complied
with. Accordingly, any entity which intends to conduct activities regulated by the Austrian Banking
Act or the Securities Supervision Act in Austria or, from outside of Austria, into Austria on a
commercial basis, requires a respective license or successful completion of EEA notification
procedures. The conducting of such regulated activities in Austria without the necessary license or
successful completion of EEA notification procedures can trigger in particular administrative fines
and civil law sanctions. The Banking Act and the Securities Supervision Act, respectively, provide
that whoever conducts banking transactions (a) set out in Art. 4 para 1 no 1 of European law
regulation 575/2013 (i.e. taking deposits and granting credit) without the required authorization is
guilty of an administrative offence and may be subject to an administrative fine of up to
EUR 5 million or up to twice the benefit derived from such violation, in case the benefit can be
quantified or (b) other banking/investment services transactions without the required authorization is
guilty of an administrative offence and may be subject to an administrative fine of up to
EUR 100,000. Furthermore, the laws provide that whoever conducts such regulated activities
unlicensed shall not be entitled to any compensation connected with such activities (e.g. interests,
commissions, fees, etc.); sureties (B¨urgschaften) and guarantees granted in connection therewith
are ineffective. Furthermore, a civil law suits for unfair competition by competitors are possible. The
transaction (agreement) itself, however, remains valid.

_Stamp Duty_

Under the Austrian Stamp Duty Act (Geb¨uhrengesetz), stamp duty is triggered upon the
creation of a document (Urkunde; a term which has a technical meaning within the context of the
Stamp Duty Act) on certain dutiable transactions enumerated in the Stamp Duty Act. Dutiable
transactions include, e.g., lease agreements, sureties, assignments, mortgages.

According to the Austrian Stamp Duty Act, stamp duty on, e.g.:

(a) sureties (B¨urgschaft) amounts to 1% of the guaranteed amount (a guarantee may be
treated as a surety for stamp duty purposes if the guarantor under the guarantee does
not explicitly waive all claims, remedies or defences with respect to the underlying
guaranteed transaction); and

(b) assignments amounts to 0.8% of the consideration for the assignment, or, in case of an
assignment for security (Sicherungszession), 0.8% of the higher of the secured amount
and the value of the assigned receivables.

Dutiable transactions for security (in particular sureties, assignments, mortgages) may be
exempt from stamp duty if such transaction (exclusively and directly) secures claims against a
borrower under a loan or credit agreement (section 20(5) of the Austrian Stamp Duty Act). Note that

282


-----

this exemption is not available for security transactions which only indirectly secure a loan or credit
agreement or which secure obligations of other obligors (such as guarantors).

Basically, Austrian stamp duty is triggered if a document on a dutiable transaction is created in
Austria and such transaction is not exempt. Under certain circumstances, also the creation of a
document on a dutiable transaction outside of Austria may trigger stamp duty. Stamp duty may
generally be triggered for a document created outside of Austria if (i) the parties to the transaction
are resident for stamp duty purposes in Austria (Austrian residence, place of habitual abode, seat,
place of effective management or permanent establishment) and (ii) the transaction concerns an
Austrian situated asset or a party to the transaction is entitled or obliged to performance under the
transaction in Austria.

If the creation of a document outside of Austria did not trigger Austrian stamp duty, stamp
duty may be triggered if the document (or a certified copy thereof) is imported into Austria and
(i) the transaction concerns an Austrian situated asset or a party to the transaction is entitled or
obliged to performance under the transaction in Austria, or (ii) a legally relevant action is taken in
Austria based on the transaction or official use of the document (or a certified copy thereof) is
made in Austria.

Austrian stamp duty may also be triggered by a document that refers to a dutiable transaction
in a qualified manner (so called confirming document; rechtsbezeugende Urkunde). According to
the Austrian Federal Ministry of Finance, a confirming document within the present context is
constituted if the parties to and the nature of the transaction referred to may be derived from the
document. Such document may (already) trigger Austrian stamp duty if signed by one of the parties
and sent to the other party or its representative (or, in case of a transaction under which both
parties are obliged to performance, a third party in order to furnish proof of the underlying
transaction). Further, stamp duty may be triggered by a so called substitute document
(Ersatzurkunde; e.g., a signed protocol on an orally agreed transaction) on a dutiable transaction or
a document that incorporates by reference a document on a dutiable transaction.

If Austrian stamp duty is triggered, pursuant to the Stamp Duty Act generally the parties to the
transaction are jointly and severally liable for the amount of Austrian stamp duty triggered. In case
of a transaction under which only one party is obliged to performance, the party in whose interest
the document was created is liable for the stamp duty (e.g., the beneficiary in case of a surety). In
any case, the other party (as well as, if the competent tax office is not duly notified of the dutiable
transaction, the persons who would be responsible for such notification) would be secondarily liable
for the stamp duty triggered. Agreements between the parties as to who shall bear stamp duty if
triggered are not binding on the tax authorities but may be honored by the tax authorities within
their discretion.

If stamp duty was triggered and not duly paid or the competent tax office was not duly notified
of a dutiable transaction, the competent tax office may, within its discretion, increase the amount of
stamp duty due by up to 100 per cent, depending on whether the taxpayer could have recognized
that stamp duty was triggered, the notification was made with slight or substantial delay, or
provisions of the Stamp Duty Act have been infringed for the first time or repeatedly.

_Shadow Director_

A person granted the rights of information and control and that actually influences the
management of an Austrian guarantor could, depending on the extent of such rights granted and
the actual use of such rights, qualify as shadow director (faktischer Gesch¨aftsf¨uhrer). A person
qualifying as such could be liable for any acts made in connection with the management company
(the shadow director in general has the same obligations and liability as a regular director

283


-----

appointed in accordance with applicable corporate law); in particular the shadow director could be
liable towards the company and, potentially, also towards the creditors of the company.

_Appointment of a Curator_

Pursuant to the Act on Curators regarding Partial Debentures (Kuratorengesetz), a curator may
be appointed as representative for the holders of partial debentures (Teilschuldverschreibungen) by
the competent court under specific circumstances, in particular if rights of holders of such partial
debentures might be endangered due to the lack of common representation. Following this, in
general and with regard to the scope of the representation by the curator, the respective holders of
such partial debentures may not exert their rights arising out of the partial debentures on their own
as such rights are then exerted by the curator; however, they are in general entitled to accede to
the respective legal proceedings initiated by the curator against the Issuers as intervenors
(Nebenintervenient).

_Enforceability of Judgments_

According to the Austrian Enforcement Act (Exekutionsordnung), foreign judgments are only
enforceable if reciprocity is warranted by a bilateral or multilateral treaty between the countries
involved or by an ordinance (Verordnung) of the Austrian government (in which ordinance the
Austrian government confirms the reciprocity). As reciprocal recognition and enforcement of
judgments, other than arbitration awards, within the meaning of section 79 of the Austrian of the
Austrian Enforcement Act between Austria and the U.S is currently not ensured by bilateral treaties
or otherwise, judgments of a United States court are not recognized and enforceable in Austria.
Therefore, a judgment rendered by any court in the United States (whether a Federal court or a
State court) against an Austrian guarantor or against an Austrian collateral provider whether or not
predicated solely upon U.S. securities laws will not be enforceable in Austria. Accordingly, the
subject matter upon which a judgment has been obtained in a United States federal or state court
must be re-litigated before Austrian courts in accordance with applicable Austrian Civil Procedure
Laws (Zivilprozessverfahren). Only after having obtained a final judgment before Austrian courts,
enforcement procedures can be initiated under the Austrian Enforcement Act.

**Belgium**

**_Certain Insolvency Considerations_**

A number of the guarantors are incorporated under the laws of Belgium (the ‘‘Belgian
guarantors’’). Consequently, in the event of an insolvency of any of the Belgian guarantors, main
insolvency proceedings may be initiated in Belgium, to the extent the Belgian guarantors are
viewed to have their centre of main interests in Belgium. Such main proceedings may also be
initiated against companies incorporated under the laws of a foreign jurisdiction to the extent that
the centre of their main interests is located in Belgium. In addition, and in accordance with the
Recast Regulation, secondary proceedings may be initiated against companies which have an
establishment (but not their centre of main interests) in Belgium. Proceedings opened in Belgium
will be governed by Belgian insolvency law, whereby for secondary proceedings, the effects of
Belgian insolvency law will be limited to assets located in Belgium.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of Belgian insolvency law.

Belgian insolvency laws provide for two main types of insolvency proceedings: judicial
reorganisation proceedings (gerechtelijke reorganisatie/r´eorganisation judiciaire) and bankruptcy
proceedings (faillissement/faillite).

284


-----

_Judicial reorganisation_

Judicial reorganisation is a reorganisation procedure for which companies of which the
continuity is threatened, in the short or longer term, may apply. It aims to preserve the continuity of
a company as a going concern, and offers a stay for an initial duration of maximum six months,
extendable in certain circumstances.

_Voluntary procedure (with exceptions)_

It is a voluntary procedure and the debtor is, as a rule, the only person who can apply for
judicial reorganisation. An exception applies to type III judicial reorganisation proceedings (courtorganised auction), the opening of which can also be requested by third parties (creditors,
interested third parties, and the public prosecutor).

A debtor may file a petition for judicial reorganisation if the continuity of the enterprise is at
risk, whether in the short or longer term. The continuity of the enterprise in any case (without
limitation) is deemed to be threatened when its net assets have fallen (as a result of losses) below
50% of the company’s registered capital, but this presumption does not trigger an obligation for the
debtor to file for judicial reorganisation.

Third parties can request the opening of type III judicial reorganisation proceedings to the
extent they can evidence that the conditions for bankruptcy are met, and the debtor has not applied
for protection under the judicial reorganisation act.

_Objectives of the procedure_

The judicial reorganisation procedure gives a debtor the framework to pursue one of the
following objectives, which it has to choose from in its petition to the competent commercial court:
(i) an amiable in-court agreement with two or more creditors; (ii) a collective reorganisation plan
applying to all creditors; or (iii) a court-organised auction leading to the transfer of part or all of the
assets of the undertaking as a going concern. The debtor has some flexibility to change the
objective so chosen in the course of the proceeding, or to choose different objectives for the
various activities of the company. In certain circumstances, the public prosecutor, a creditor or any
third party having an interest in acquiring, in whole or in part, the debtor’s enterprise, may apply to
the court to change the objective to a court-organised transfer. The objective may also depend on
the position of the court and/or third parties.

_Debtor in possession_

During the judicial reorganisation procedure, the board of directors and management of the
debtor remain as a rule in charge of the company while the procedure is ongoing. However, upon
request of the debtor or any other interested party and to the extent it is deemed useful for
reaching the aims of the reorganisation, the court may appoint, in its decision to open the judicial
reorganisation procedure or at any other point in time during the course of the procedure, a judicial
administrator (gerechtsmandataris/mandataire de justice) to assist the board of directors or
management of the debtor during the reorganisation. The court may also appoint a judicial
administrator entrusted with tasks it deems necessary to the extent the debtor or its board is viewed
to have been grossly shortcoming (kennelijke grove tekortkoming/manquement grave et caract´eris´e).
The court can also, in certain exceptional circumstances (clear bad faith or clear gross mistake
(kennelijke grove fout/faute grave et caract´eris´ee) opt to replace the board of directors or
management of the debtor by an interim manager appointed by the court (voorlopig bestuurder/
_administrateur provisoire)._

285


-----

Finally, note that although the board of directors and management of the debtor remains (in
principle) in place during type III reorganisation proceedings (court-organised auction), the auction
process will be led by the court-appointed judicial administrator(s), under supervision of the court
(who will finally decide which bidder is allowed to purchase the assets under auction).

_Filing for judicial reorganisation_

As long as the court overseeing a judicial reorganisation has not issued a ruling on the judicial
reorganisation petition, the debtor cannot be declared bankrupt or wound up by court order. In
addition, during the period between the filing of the petition and the court’s decision on the opening
of the judicial reorganisation procedure, none of the debtor’s assets may be disposed of by any of
its creditors as a result of the enforcement of any security interests that such creditors may hold
with respect to such assets (subject to certain limited exceptions).

_Opening of judicial reorganisation — Duration of stay_

Within a period of fourteen days as from the filing of the petition and subject to the satisfaction
of the filing conditions, the court will declare the judicial reorganisation procedure open, and will set
the initial duration of the stay for a period of up to six months, extendable in certain (exceptional)
circumstances of up to 18 months (extendable with another six months in case the judicial
reorganisation does not culminate in a collective reorganisation plan but leads to a transfer of all or
part of the undertaking).

_Creditors’ rights during the stay_

During the stay, as a rule, the debtor cannot be judicially dissolved or declared bankrupt, and,
generally (subject to exceptions), no enforcement measures (e.g., attachment or foreclosure) can
be taken or continued for claims that pre-date the opening of the judicial reorganisation procedure.
Conservatory attachments made prior to the opening of the judicial reorganisation retain their
conservatory character, but the court may order their release, provided that such release does not
have a material adverse effect on the situation of the creditor concerned.

The stay affects secured and unsecured creditors alike, with the exception of secured creditors
benefiting from a specific receivables pledge or financial collateral (including cash collateral, title
transfer collateral, repo’s and pledges in respect of financial instruments), which, subject to certain
exceptions in respect of cash collateral, are entitled to foreclose during the stay.

In the absence of contractual netting clauses, netting between claims that arose prior to the
opening of the judicial reorganisation procedure and claims that arose after the opening of the
judicial reorganisation procedure will only be allowed between ‘‘closely tied’’ reciprocal claims.

The stay will not suspend third-party guarantees or third-party security. It will further have no
impact on co-debtors’ obligations.

The stay further does not prevent voluntary payment by the debtor of its debts, including
those preceding the judicial reorganisation, provided that such payment is needed to secure the
continuity of the enterprise.

_(Cross-)default clauses_

The reorganisation procedure aims to preserve the continuity of a company as a going
concern. Consequently, the initiation of the procedure does not terminate any contracts, and
contractual provisions which provide for the early termination or acceleration of the contract by the
fact of the judicial reorganisation itself are null and void (with the exception of close-out netting
clauses).

286


-----

Other types of (cross-)default clauses are valid and enforceable (e.g., termination for
non-payment of principal sum), even if triggered after the opening of the judicial reorganisation. In
the event that a creditor would exercise its right to terminate an agreement following the opening of
the procedure of judicial reorganisation on the basis of such type of (cross-)default clause which
has been triggered before the opening of the judicial reorganisation, the debtor would by law
benefit from a 15-day cure-period of its receiving notice of termination to remedy the (cross-)default
situation.

Fixed indemnity clauses (i.e., clauses pursuant to which a pre-agreed lump sum indemnity is
paid to a debtor to cover the potential damages resulting from a default), including clauses to
increase the interest rate upon default, are unenforceable during the stay and cannot be entered in
a reorganisation plan. The creditor is, however, entitled to claim its actual damages in the
reorganisation plan, in which case such creditor is deemed to have definitively waived its fixed
indemnity, and such waiver will remain in force even after the full execution of the reorganisation
plan. Certain authoritative scholars have argued that, as from the full execution of the reorganisation
plan, the debtor is freed from all fixed indemnities that arose before that time, even if the creditor of
such fixed indemnity has not opted to claim actual damages instead of its fixed indemnity.

_Ongoing contracts_

As an exception to the general rule of continuity of contracts, the debtor may elect, within two
weeks of the court’s decision to open the reorganisation proceeding, not to perform a contract
(other than an employment contract) during the entire period of the stay provided that such
non-performance is necessary for the reorganisation plan or the transfer of the enterprise under
court supervision. This possibility is not available in the ‘‘out of court amicable settlement’’ option.
Should the debtor so elect not to perform the contract, Belgian contract law in turn allows the
creditor to suspend performance its obligations under the contract (on the basis of the exception
_non adimpleti contractus)._

_Continuing the contract despite the judicial reorganisation_

If a creditor continues to perform a contract despite the debtor’s judicial reorganisation, its
claims that come to exist as a result thereof in the period following the opening of the judicial
reorganisation will not be suspended and will be enforceable. In case of a subsequent bankruptcy,
and subject to certain conditions, such claims will have priority over the claims of unsecured
creditors (and secured creditors, if the continuation of the contract has contributed to the
preservation of the secured assets).

_Objectives of the procedure — In-court amicable agreement_

An in-court amicable agreement requires unanimity among the creditors concerned. The
debtor may petition the court to grant a grace period in respect of its payment obligations, e.g., in
relation to interest payments, pending the negotiation of the agreement. Once agreement is
reached, the court will record it. The agreement will be publicly available, but its contents will not,
and its terms will only be binding upon the creditors that have agreed to it.

_Objectives of the procedure — Reorganisation plan_

In the case of a judicial reorganisation by collective agreement, the creditors agree to a
reorganisation plan during the reorganisation procedure.

_Procedure._ Within a period of fourteen days following the opening of the judicial
reorganisation procedure, the debtor must inform each of its creditors individually of the amount of
their claims against the debtor as recorded in the books of the debtor, as well as of details

287


-----

regarding security interests, if applicable. A copy of such a communication to the creditors is sent
to the clerk’s office of the commercial court.

Creditors with pre-existing claims, as well as any other interested party that claims to be a
creditor, can challenge the amounts and the ranking of the secured claims declared by the debtor.
The court will determine either on a preliminary basis for the purpose of the reorganisation
procedure (if the court has no jurisdiction over such claims) or definitely (if the court has jurisdiction
over such claims), the disputed amounts and the ranking of such claims.

_Measures._ The reorganisation plan may include, without limitation, (i) a rescheduling of
debts, (ii) debt waivers (principal sum and/or interest), (iii) the conversion of debt into equity, and
(iv) a differentiated treatment for certain categories of claims (e.g., based on nature or size). The
performance period of the plan may not exceed five years from the date of court approval. The plan
cannot impose any of these measures to secured creditors (unless they individually agree) or
reduce the claims of its employees resulting from work performed prior to the opening of the
reorganisation procedure. In addition, the reorganisation plan may not impose a waiver of more
than 85% of the outstanding claim of a creditor, except if a more substantial reduction is motivated
by compelling reasons related to the continuity of the enterprise. Public creditors that benefit from a
general lien, such as the social security administration or the tax administration, will, in principle,
benefit from the same regime as the best treated creditors under the reorganisation plan.

_Vote._ The reorganisation plan must be approved by the majority of the creditors participating
in the vote (including the secured creditors) and such majority must represent at least half of the
outstanding debt in principal sum. The court must also approve the plan, and can only refuse it in
limited circumstances. The court-approved reorganisation plan is binding for all creditors in the stay
including those who voted against it or did not vote and whether secured or not, subject to limited
exceptions. The plan must be filed with the clerk’s office of the commercial court at least twenty
days before the date on which the creditors will vote on the approval of the reorganisation plan.

_Secured creditors._ The plan may provide for a suspension of the enforcement rights of
secured creditors but such suspension may not exceed 24 months (extendable with 12 months if
the debtor can prove that it will be able to fully reimburse the secured creditors) from the initial
filing for judicial reorganisation, and the company must in any event continue to pay interest on the
secured obligations during the period of the reorganisation plan. In the absence of their individual
agreement, the plan cannot contain any other measure affecting the rights of the secured creditors.

_Objectives of the procedure — Court-ordered transfer_

The court-ordered transfer of all or part of the debtor’s enterprise can be requested by the
debtor in its petition or at a later stage in the procedure. It can be requested by the public
prosecutor, by a creditor or by any party who has an interest in acquiring, in whole or in part, the
debtor’s enterprise, and the court can order such transfer in specific circumstances.

In case the judicial reorganisation procedure would culminate in a transfer of the undertaking,
the proceeds of the sale of the pledged assets will be paid in priority to the relevant secured
creditors. The judicial administrator leading the auction may only accept offers if the proposed
purchase price at least equals the expected proceeds of a forced sale of such assets in a
bankruptcy or liquidation. The assets will be transferred free from any existing security, subject
however to the rights of creditors holding in rem security over assets of the debtor located in
another EU member state.

288


-----

_Bankruptcy — Initiative_

A bankruptcy procedure may be initiated by the bankrupt debtor, unpaid creditors or upon the
initiative of the public prosecutor or by the liquidator of the ‘‘main insolvency proceeding’’ in
another EU member state according to the EU Insolvency Regulation.

_Bankruptcy — Grounds_

A company can be declared bankrupt if (i) it is in a situation of cessation of payments (staking
_van betaling/cessation de paiements) — i.e., it is persistently unable to make payments when they_
become due; and (ii) it is unable to obtain further credit at normal commercial terms (wiens krediet
_geschokt is/´ebranlement de credit)._

The directors of the debtor company are under an obligation to file for bankruptcy within one
month of the date of cessation of payments, and failure to do so is a criminal offence.

_Bankruptcy — Appointment of bankruptcy trustee and continuation of business_

In bankruptcy, the debtor loses all authority and decision rights concerning the management
of the bankrupt business. The court-appointed bankruptcy trustee (curator/curateur) is responsible
for the operation of the business and for implementing the sale of the debtor’s assets, the
distribution of the sale proceeds to creditors and, ultimately, the liquidation of the bankrupt debtor.
The rights of creditors in the process are limited to being informed of the course of the bankruptcy
proceedings on a regular basis by the receiver. Creditors may oppose the sale of assets by
bringing an action before the court, or may request the temporary continued operation of the
business.

The bankruptcy trustee may elect to continue the business of the debtor, provided the
bankruptcy trustee obtains the authorisation of the court and such continuation does not cause any
prejudice to the creditors.

_Bankruptcy — Ongoing contracts_

The bankruptcy trustee must decide whether or not to continue performance under ongoing
contracts. Two exceptions to the decision to continue contracts apply:

(i) the parties to an agreement may contractually agree that the occurrence of a bankruptcy
constitutes an early termination or acceleration event; and

(ii) intuitu personae contracts (i.e., contracts whereby the identity of the other party
constitutes an essential element upon the signing of the contract) are automatically
terminated as of the date of the judgment opening the bankruptcy since the debtor is no
longer responsible for the management of its business as of that date. Parties can agree
to continue to perform under such contracts.

The bankruptcy trustee may elect not to perform the obligations of the bankrupt party which
are still to be performed after the bankruptcy under any agreement validly entered into by the
bankrupt party prior to the bankruptcy if such decision is necessary for the management and
liquidation of the bankrupt estate. The counterparty to that agreement may file a claim for damages
in the bankruptcy proceedings — such claim will rank pari passu with claims of all other unsecured
creditors — and/or seek a court order to have the relevant contract terminated. The counterparty is
not entitled to seek injunctive relief or require specific performance of the contract.

289


-----

If the bankruptcy trustee decides to continue to perform the obligations of the bankrupt party
under an agreement, claims of the counterparty will have priority over the claims of unsecured
creditors, to the extent that such claims relate to obligations under the agreement performed after
the opening of the bankruptcy.

_Bankruptcy — Creditors’ rights_

Save for secured creditors benefiting from financial collateral (including cash collateral, title
transfer collateral, repo’s and pledges in respect of financial instruments), which are entitled to
enforce their rights notwithstanding the opening of bankruptcy proceedings, the enforcement rights
of individual creditors are suspended upon the opening of the bankruptcy proceedings.

As from the date of the bankruptcy judgment, no further interest accrues against the bankrupt
debtor on its unsecured debt.

_Bankruptcy — Priority order_

Ranking of claims against the bankrupt estate are subject to an elaborate set of rules. The
following is a general overview of certain of these rules:

_Estate debt:_ Costs and indebtedness incurred by the bankruptcy trustee during the
bankruptcy proceedings, so-called ‘‘estate debts’’, have senior priority. In addition, if the bankruptcy
trustee has contributed to the realisation and enforcement of secured assets (including charges for
(i) assessing the value of the secured asset(s) and (ii) realising the secured asset(s)), such costs
will be paid to the receiver in priority out of the proceeds of the realised assets before distributing
the remainder to the secured creditors;

   - Security interests: Creditors that hold security interests have a priority right over the
proceeds resulting from the enforcement (whether by means of appropriation or sale) of the
collateral assets;

   - Legal liens: Certain creditors may have liens on certain or all assets (e.g., tax claims, claims
for social security premiums, etc.). Liens on specific assets rank before liens on the entirety
of the debtor’s assets; and

   - Pari passu: Once all estate debts and creditors’ claims benefitting from security interests
and/or legal liens have been satisfied, the proceeds of the remaining assets will be
distributed by the bankruptcy trustee amongst the unsecured creditors who rank pari passu
(unless a creditor agreed to be subordinated).

_Bankruptcy — Hardening Periods and Fraudulent Transfer_

Pursuant to the Belgian Bankruptcy Law (Law of August 8, 1997), certain transactions deemed
detrimental to the bankrupt estate’s creditors may be declared ineffective against third parties if
concluded or performed during a so-called ‘‘hardening period’’ (verdachte periode/periode
_suspecte). This hardening period starts from the date as of which the debtor is deemed to have_
been in a situation of cessation of payments, as may be determined ex post by the commercial
court in charge of the bankruptcy proceedings. While, as a rule, the cessation of payments is
deemed to have occurred as of the date on which the company is declared bankrupt by the court,
the court may determine, based on serious and objective indications, that the cessation of
payments occurred on an earlier date, which, in principle, may not be earlier than six months
before the date of the bankruptcy order, except in cases where the bankruptcy order relates to a
company that was dissolved more than six months before the date of the bankruptcy order in
circumstances suggesting an intent to defraud its creditors. In the latter case, the date of cessation
of payments may be determined as being the date of such decision to dissolve the company. The

290


-----

period from the date of cessation of payments up to the declaration of bankruptcy is referred to as
the ‘‘hardening period’’.

At the request of the bankruptcy trustee, the court shall declare void the following type of
transactions if entered into by the bankrupt company during the hardening period:

   - contracts made without consideration or where the consideration is manifestly inadequate;

   - the granting of security for pre-existing debt;

   - payments made other than in cash (unless that was contemplated at the outset); or

   - the prepayment of debt.

In addition, the court may, at the request of the trustee and in its discretion, declare void any
other transaction made after the company became insolvent, when the contracting party knew of
such insolvency when entering into the transaction and the court determines that voiding the
transaction would benefit the bankruptcy estate.

Finally, any transaction or payment made with fraudulent intent can be declared void
irrespective of its date.

The proceeds of an unenforceable or void transaction will benefit the creditors as a whole
(through the bankrupt estate) rather than the creditor next in rank.

**_Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees_**

The Belgian Companies Code (Wetboek van Vennootschappen/Code des Soci´et´es) (‘‘BCC’’)
limits the ability for companies organised under Belgian law to grant guarantees for the
performance of third parties’ obligations:

   - A Belgian company may not make loans or grant guarantees with the view to the acquisition
of its shares by a third party.

   - The granting of a guarantee over its assets may not violate a company’s corporate purpose,
as set out in its articles of association.

The sanction of acting outside the scope of the corporate purpose clause as set out in the
articles of association is joint and several directors’ liability, and, if the beneficiary acted in
bad faith, the guarantee or security could be declared void. Bad faith is found when the
beneficiary knew or should have known that the company was acting outside of the scope
of its corporate purpose.

   - Providing a guarantee without deriving or having a possibility to derive any direct or indirect
profit could be considered a gratuitous act contrary to a profit corporation’s legal and
essential mission to pursue profit.

If found gratuitous, the guarantee is considered to be contrary to public policy and is as
such voidable. Each party with a valid interest, including the guarantor, can request the
guarantee to be declared void, even if such party contributed to the gratuitous nature of the
guarantee. Case law and legal writing give a rather narrow interpretation of a ‘‘gratuitous
act’’ in this context and a remote and indirect benefit should satisfy this test.

   - The granting of a guarantee must serve the company’s corporate interest, which is to be
assessed on a case-by-case basis and taking into account any direct and/or indirect benefit
that the company would derive from the transaction as a whole. Compliance with corporate
benefit is a factual assessment to be made by the board of directors of the company and is
ultimately subject to the appreciation of the court.

291


-----

The sanction of acting outside of the corporate interest is individual directors’ liability. A
guarantee contrary to the corporate benefit can be declared void or considered
unenforceable in specific circumstances (e.g., illicit cause, abuse of majority in the vote,
fraudulent conveyance, co-contractor’s knowledge). Some authors have pleaded for a
decrease of the amount of the guarantee.

In practice, limitation language is often included in order to provide that the obligations of a
guarantor are limited by reference to:

   - the amounts lent or on-lent to that obligor; and/or

   - a certain percentage of the net assets of the guarantor.

The indenture will expressly provide substantially as follows:

In the case of a Belgian guarantor, with respect to the obligations of any obligor which is not a
subsidiary of such Belgian guarantor, its liability under the guarantee clause of the Indenture shall
be limited, at any time, to a maximum aggregate amount equal to the greater of:

(a) An amount equal to 80% of such Belgian guarantor’s net assets (as determined in
accordance with articles 320 for SPRL/BVBA) and 617 (for SA/NV) of the Belgian
Companies Code and accounting principles generally accepted in Belgium, but not
taking intragroup debt into account as debts) as shown by its most recent audited
annual financial statements on the date on which the relevant demand is made; and

(b) The aggregate amount outstanding on the date on which the relevant demand is made
of (i) the amounts (including interest thereon, commissions, costs and fees) made
available directly or indirectly to such Belgian guarantor from the proceeds of the notes,
and (ii) the aggregate amount of any intragroup loans or facilities to it by any group
company directly and/or indirectly using all or part of the proceeds of the notes (whether
or not such intragroup loan is retained by the Belgian guarantor for its own purposes or
on-lent to a subsidiary of such Belgian guarantor).

In addition, Belgian courts may, in any civil proceeding involving a debtor, defer or otherwise
reasonably reschedule the payment dates of payment obligations. Belgian courts can also decide
that the interest rate applicable be reduced if it is considered to exceed the normal rate applicable
to similar debts.

Further, Belgian courts may condition the enforcement of a guarantee upon the evidence that
the creditor has a final and undisputed claim triggering the foreclosure of the guarantee.
Enforcement of guarantees may be hindered by conflict of law and/or conflict of jurisdiction issues
and may not breach any public policy provision and/or mandatory legal provisions. Courts may
require a sworn translation in French or Dutch of the English documents which they may review.

**Brazil**

**_Certain Insolvency Considerations_**

Under Brazilian law, a company or individual entrepreneur will be considered bankrupt
whenever (i) fails, without any sound legal ground, to pay a debt which is represented by a
protested enforceable instrument and exceeds the equivalent of 40 minimum wages, the total of
which currently equates to BRL 37,480 (as of January 1, 2017); or (ii) a foreclosure proceeding is
pending and it does not pay, deposit or appoint sufficient assets to secure the proceeding within
the requisite legal term. A debtor may also be considered bankrupt if it (i) sells its assets in a
precipitated manner or resorts to ruinous or fraudulent means to make payments, (ii) performs (or
tries to perform by unequivocal actions) a fraudulent (sham) transaction or the disposal of part or

292


-----

all of its assets to a third party, with the objective of delaying payments or defrauding creditors,
(iii) transfers its place of business without the consent of all creditors and does not maintain
sufficient assets to settle its liabilities, (iv) performs a fraudulent (sham) transaction to transfer its
main place of business to evade the law or to prejudice a creditor, (v) gives or increases security
for an existing debt and does not maintain sufficient free and clear assets to settle its liabilities,
(vi) becomes absent without leaving any competent representative with enough resources to pay
the creditors, (vii) abandons its place of business or tries to hide from its domicile, head office or
main place of business, and/or (viii) fails to perform an obligation due under a judicial
reorganization plan.

Brazilian bankruptcy laws may be less favorable to creditors than those of certain other
jurisdictions. Noteholders may have limited voting rights at creditors’ meetings in the context of a
court reorganization proceeding, as explained below. In addition, any judgment obtained in Brazilian
courts in respect of any payment obligations under the guarantee normally would be expressed in
the real equivalent of the foreign currency amount of such sum at the exchange rate in effect (i) on
the date of actual payment, (ii) on the date on which such judgment is rendered, or (iii) on the date
on which collection or enforcement proceedings are started against a Brazilian company.

In the event of bankruptcy, all credits, claims and pecuniary obligations, including the
guarantee and security interest under the Indenture, which are denominated in foreign currency, will
be converted into Brazilian Reals at the prevailing exchange rate on the date of declaration of the
bankruptcy by the court.

_Fraud Against Creditors_

In general, if a debtor disposes of its property in a malicious manner when insolvent or to the
level where remaining assets will be insufficient to ensure the payment of its obligations, such
transfer would be fraudulent against creditors. Section 159 et seq of the Brazilian Civil Code (Law
No. 10,406 of January 10, 2002, as amended) establishes that transactions for no consideration
(i.e., donations or disposal or encumbrance of assets) may be declared null and void if
consummated (i) when debtor was already insolvent or became insolvent as a result of the
fraudulent transaction; and (ii) with frivolous intention to defraud creditors. In addition, onerous
transactions (transactions for consideration) are also voidable if consummated when debtor’s
insolvency is known or should be known by the debtor’s counterparty in the relevant transaction.
For the purposes of the Brazilian Civil Code, a debtor is insolvent when its liabilities exceed its
assets (balance sheet test).

Accordingly two elements must be generally satisfied for avoiding an antecedent transaction
perpetrated in fraud against creditors: (a) objectively, transactions must cause debtor’s insolvency
and/or be implemented when debtor was already insolvent (eventus damni); and (b) subjectively,
parties must implement the transaction with fraudulent intent (consilium fraudis), mainly to defraud
debtor’s existing creditors or when the counterparty was (or should have been) aware about the
debtors’ insolvency. A creditor may challenge transactions entered into by the Issuer or Diversey
Brasil Industria Quimica Ltda. on the grounds above.

_Fraud Against Enforcement Proceedings_

The encumbrance or disposal of debtor’s assets while pending an enforcement proceeding
(a¸c˜ao de execu¸c˜ao) against the debtor seeking to collect an unpaid debt under a fast-track
procedure may be considered fraud against enforcement proceeding, as set forth in section 792 of
the Brazilian Code of Civil Procedure (Law No. 13,105 of March 16, 2015, as amended). Court
precedents and legal writing generally supports the view that the disposal or encumbrance debtor’s
asset may be considered ineffective if, cumulatively, (i) the enforcement proceeding is preexisting

293


-----

(antecedent) to the transaction; (ii) buyer or debtor’s counterparty was (should be) unequivocally
aware of the antecedent enforcement proceeding; and (iii) transaction compromised debtor’s
capability to solve its obligations. A creditor may challenge transactions entered into by the Issuer
or Diversey Brasil Industria Quimica Ltda under the circumstances above or under other
circumstances set forth under section 792 of the Brazilian Code of Civil Procedure, such as (i) the
existence of pending litigation regarding the in rem rights over the underlying asset, (ii) the
existence of an enforcement proceeding or of a judicial lien over the asset has been registered
under the registry of the asset.

_Bankruptcy Liquidation and Antecedent Transactions_

The Brazilian Bankruptcy Law (Law No. 11.101 of February 9, 2005 —’’BBL) also regulates
scenarios where antecedent transactions are deemed ineffective or voidable. Indeed, certain
specific acts and contracts performed under a statutory period before the adjudication of debtor’s
bankruptcy liquidation (falˆencia) are considered ineffective. Further, acts performed with the intent to
hinder or defraud creditors may also be declared null and void. Section 129 of the BBL establishes
that certain acts performed during a claw-back (look-back) period (termo legal) shall be declared
ineffective in relation to the estate. The claw-back can generally retroact up to the 90- days period
prior to: (a) the filing of a bankruptcy liquidation (involuntary) request by debtor’s creditor; (b) the
filing for court-protection under judicial reorganization (in case judicial reorganization has been
subsequently converted into bankruptcy liquidation proceedings); or (c) outstanding protest of a
debtor’s title due to lack of payment.

Ineffectiveness declaration under Section 129 of the BBL should apply regardless of whether
the involved parties were aware of the financial condition of the debtor or had the intention to
defraud creditors. The following actions (inter alia) if consummated during the claw-back period
shall be considered objectively ineffective: (i) payment of obligations not matured (i.e. preferred
payment); (ii) payment of matured obligations in a different manner than originally established by
the parties in the relevant contracts; and (iii) creation of collateral to secure an existing unsecured
debt. The transfer of substantially all debtor’s assets shall also be ineffective if consummated
without consent or payment of all creditors existing at the time of the transfer.

The ineffectiveness of the transaction can be recognized and declared by the Bankruptcy
Court on its own initiative (ex officio). It can be argued as a defense under and during bankruptcy
liquidation proceedings or in an independent lawsuit or ancillary proceeding filed for this purpose
by the court-appointed trustee or interested parties. It is generally accepted that there is no time
constrains or statute of limitations for the declaration of ineffectiveness of acts performed before the
bankruptcy adjudication, provided the transaction was consummated during the claw-back period
or other statutory period specifically set forth in the BBL.

In addition, similarly to the fraud against creditors under the Brazilian Civil Code, transactions
implemented before or after debtor’s bankruptcy liquidation adjudication may be revoked if they
were performed fraudulently, irrespective if they were committed during the claw-back period.
Indeed, section 130 of BBL establishes that acts performed with the intent to defraud creditors may
be revoked, provided there is evidence of (i) the fraudulent collusion between the debtor and the
contracting third party; and (ii) the actual loss suffered by the estate.

The court-appointed Trustee, the Public Prosecutor Office and creditors are entitled to file a
claw-back lawsuit (a¸c˜ao revocat´oria) seeking the avoidance and nullification of the fraudulent
transaction. Also similarly to the revocation lawsuit under the Brazilian Civil Code, if the claw-back
litigation is successful, disposal or encumbrance of estate’s assets should be considered null and
void and parties should return to status quo with the relevant assets (or equivalent cash
indemnification if the asset is unavailable) returning to the estate. Note that to ensure the end result

of the claw-back proceeding the Bankruptcy Court may order the precautionary freezing and
attachment of defendant’s assets.

_Formal Procedures for Insolvency_

The main types of formal procedures available for companies in financial difficulties are:
(i) out-of-court reorganization (also known as extrajudicial reorganization) (recupera¸c˜ao
_extrajudicial); (ii) judicial reorganization (recupera¸c˜ao judicial); and (iii) bankruptcy liquidation_
(falˆencia). BBL provides that some credits are not impaired by judicial reorganization proceedings
(such as tax credits and credits secured by fiduciary liens) and the measures (before courts or not)
taken by the respective creditors, as a rule, are not subject to staying effects of the judicial
reorganization proceedings.

_Out-of-Court Reorganization_

An out-of-court reorganization is a judicial procedure designed to promote corporate
restructuring with the main goal of providing expedited confirmation of a plan of reorganization
previously negotiated and eventually accepted by requisite majorities involving certain impaired
classes of creditors or group of creditors of the same nature and similar payment conditions. Under
out-of-court proceedings, shareholders and directors keep the control and management of the
company. Debtor and creditors settle the conditions for payment of the debts, and the
reorganization plan is submitted to the court for confirmation. Creditors may file challenges to the
plan, but there are no specific legal provisions related to proof of claims (habilita¸c˜ao de cr´edito) for
an out-of-court reorganization.

_Judicial Reorganization_

Upon filing of a request for judicial reorganization and consequent acceptance of its
processing by the court, certain creditors are refrained from enforcing their rights. The BBL provides
for a stay period of 180 days, during which the creditors cannot bring or continue any legal or
enforcement proceedings against the debtor, except for those creditors holding to tax claims and
claims secured by fiduciary lien, lessors, owners or committed sellers of real estate where the
relevant agreement includes an irrevocability or irreversibility clause; and creditors holding claims
that have retention of title clauses or are beneficiaries advance on foreign exchange agreements
(adiantamento de contrato de cˆambio) (however, these creditors cannot sell or remove assets that
are deemed essential for the debtor’s activities during the stay period). In practice, the stay period
has been extended by courts whenever the delay to vote the reorganization plan is not caused by
the debtor. After such period, without the approval of a reorganization plan, creditors are generally
entitled to resume their legal proceedings against the debtor (or to initiate them). Shareholders and
directors also keep the control and management of the company, but may be removed if certain
requirements are met. A court-appointed trustee (administrador judicial) will supervise the
administrators’ acts in order to guarantee that they will comply with the legal requirements.

The debtor must formulate and submit a Plan of Reorganization within 60 days following the
Processing Order. As a rule, the Plan of Reorganization must contemplate all means that will be
employed by the debtor to reorganize and restructure the business. The BBL provides enough
flexibility to accommodate any deal the parties in interest might find to suit their needs. Normally
the Plan of Reorganization will estipulate the scale down of the pre-petition debt load with the
consent of the requisite majorities of their creditors.

Following the presentation of the Plan of Reorganization and proper notice, creditors will have
up to 30 days to file their respective objections against the Plan of Reorganization. If the Plan of

295


-----

Reorganization is objected, the Bankruptcy Court shall call a General Meeting of Creditors (‘‘GMC’’)
to deliberate and vote on the Plan of Reorganization.

In a GMC to deliberate and vote on the Plan of Reorganization, creditors are divided into
4 (four) classes, as follows: (i) holders of labor-related claims or occupational accident claims
(‘‘Labor Class’’); (ii) holders of secured claims, up to the amount of the respective collateral
(‘‘Secured Class’’); and (iii) holders of unsecured claims, with special priority claim, general priority
claim or subordinated claim (‘‘General Class’’); and (iv) small companies creditors (‘‘Small
Companies Class’’).

Consensual approval of the Plan of Reorganization (approval, rejection or modification of its
terms and conditions) requires the approval of all four classes of creditors, assuming all classes are
impaired (‘‘General Rule’’). Pursuant to the General Rule a Plan of Reorganization is considered
accepted by each of the Secured Class and the General Class when the (a) the majority in number
of creditors present at the GMC; and, cumulatively (b) the majority in amount of claims present at
the GMC vote to accept the Plan of Reorganization. In other words, the Plan of Reorganization must
be approved (in each respective class) by simple majority of creditors present (vote per head) and,
cumulatively, by the majority in amount of the claims present at the GMC (dollar amount vote). In
the Labor Class and Small Companies Class, all that is required is the approval of the majority of
creditors attending the GMC.

If the Plan of Reorganization is not approved by all classes pursuant to the General Rule, there
is an alternative form of approving and eventually confirming a Plan of Reorganization (‘‘Cram Down
Rule’’). The Cram Down Rule stipulates that a Bankruptcy Court may confirm a Plan of
Reorganization provided that the following requirements are cumulatively met: (a) the plan has
obtained the favorable vote of the simple majority in amount of all the claims present at the GMC,
regardless of the division by classes; (b) the plan has been accepted by two classes pursuant to
the General Rule; and (c) the plan has obtained the favorable vote of at least [1]⁄3 (one-third) of the
creditors in the dissident class, pursuant to the General Rule. In order to confirm a Plan of
Reorganization based on the Cram Down Rule, the Plan of Reorganization cannot estipulate
different treatment among the respective creditors of the dissident class.

If the Plan of Reorganization is approved during the GMC, the Bankruptcy Court will eventually
confirm the Plan of Reorganization and grant the judicial reorganization proceeding (‘‘Confirmation
Order’’). The Confirmation Order will discharge and novate all obligations under and subject to the
Plan of Reorganization. Given its contractual nature, the new obligations constituted under the Plan
of Reorganization will be satisfied under the (new) terms and conditions stipulated thereof and will
be binding on the debtor and its creditors, including nonaccepting (dissident) creditors and those
who affirmatively supported the Plan of Reorganization.

Creditors are also generally entitled to file proof of claims to seek inclusion or adjustment of its
respective claims to be reflected under Debtor’s list of liabilities (which should be presented by the
debtor upon the filing for reorganization).

_Bankruptcy_

The bankruptcy liquidation of a company may be requested by third parties (involuntary
bankruptcy) or by the debtor itself (voluntary bankruptcy). Once the involuntary (or voluntary)
bankruptcy request (pedido de falˆencia) is accepted and the bankruptcy decree is issued, judicial
measures filed by creditors must be stayed — and most part of the claims will be submitted to the
bankruptcy court, which has jurisdiction over the debtor assets (ju´ızo universal).

Upon adjudication of bankruptcy liquidation, the debts become due and payable (including
those of shareholders with unlimited and joint liability), with a pro rata deduction of interest, all

296


-----

foreign currency claims are converted into Brazilian real, the debtor is automatically prevented from
exercising any business activity and from managing or disposing of its assets, the court appoints a
trustee to manage and represent the bankruptcy estate, the trustee collects the debtor’s property
and assets, and value them. Shareholders cannot sell their shareholdings or otherwise withdraw
from the company. If the value of the debtor’s assets is insufficient to pay creditors, no interest
accrues on claims (except interest on debentures and secured claims, which can be paid from the
proceeds of sale of the underlying security). Agreements which the debtor entered into with third
parties are not necessarily terminated automatically. The trustee may perform these agreements if
certain requirements are met.

For bankruptcy proceedings, there is a statutory order of preferences/privileges to be
observed by the judge on the payment of the credits. Brazilian law establishes the following order
for pre-petition claims (following administrative expenses, post-petition claims and claims for
restitution): (i) claims relating to employee contracts — limited to 150 times the monthly minimum
wage per employee — and claims deriving from occupational accidents; (ii) claims of creditors that
hold in rem security (up to the value of the proceeds from the sale of the assets given as security);
(iii) tax claims, excluding fines; (iv) special privileged credits; (v) general privileged credits; (vi) all
other unsecured claims; (vii) contractual and public fines and penalties, including tax penalties; and
(viii) subordinated claims, such as claims by the debtor’s shareholders and managers which do not
have an employment relationship with the debtor.

_Participation of holders of notes in Insolvency Legal Procedures_

Courts in Brazil have taken different approaches regarding the representations of creditors of a
bond or note issuance in insolvency procedures. Some courts have admitted the representation of
the holders of notes or bonds by a trustee or agent while others have required or authorized the
direct participation of the beneficial owner of the notes, sometimes even considering the relevant
note as independent credit.

_Cross-Border Reorganization_

Brazilian law has no specific provisions on cross-border reorganization or bankruptcy
proceedings. Generally, foreign court decisions must be submitted to ratification before the Superior
Court of Justice of Brazil (Superior Tribunal de Justi¸ca) in order to become enforceable in Brazil
(homologa¸c˜ao de senten¸ca estrangeira). Court decisions taken on foreign judicial reorganization or
bankruptcy proceedings may be subject to the same proceeding, observing the proper formal and
material requirements.

On the other hand, it must be highlighted that Brazilian courts have exclusive jurisdiction over
reorganization and bankruptcy of Brazilian companies and branches of foreign companies located
in Brazil, which means that only partial decisions (for example, the recognition of credits) should be
homologated and enforced.

**_Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of Guarantees_**

In the terms and conditions of the notes, the guarantors will (1) agree that the courts of the
State of New York and the federal courts of the United States, in each case sitting in the Borough of
Manhattan, The City of New York, will have jurisdiction to hear and determine any suit, action or
proceeding, and to settle any disputes, which may arise out of or in connection with the notes and,
for such purposes, the guarantors will irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of such courts, and
(2) name an agent for service of process in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York. See
‘‘Description of Notes’’.

297


-----

The Brazil guarantor and the Issuer understand that, subject to specific requirements
described below, a final conclusive judgment for payment of a determined sum of money rendered
by any court in the United States in respect of the notes and the guarantee would be recognized in
the courts of Brazil (to the extent that Brazilian courts may have jurisdiction) and such courts would
enforce such judgment without any retrial or reexamination of the merits of the original action only if
such judgment has been previously ratified by the Superior Court of Justice of Brazil (Superior
_Tribunal de Justi¸ca), such ratification being available only if the judgment:_

   - fulfills all formalities required for its enforceability under the laws of the jurisdiction where the
judgment was rendered;

   - is issued by a competent court after proper service of process on the parties, which service
must comply with Brazilian law if made in Brazil, or after sufficient evidence of the parties
absence has been given as established pursuant to applicable law;

   - is final and therefore not subject to appeals;

   - is for payment of a specified sum of money or provides precisely how to calculate such
sum;

   - is authenticated by the competent Brazilian consulate with jurisdiction over the location of
the court which issued the judgment;

   - is translated into Portuguese by a certified translator; and

   - is not against Brazilian public policy, good morals, national sovereignty or a final decision
rendered in Brazil (not subject to further appeals.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, no assurance can be given that such ratification would be
obtained, that the process described above could be conducted in a timely manner or that a
Brazilian court would enforce a monetary judgment for violation of the U.S. securities laws with
respect to the guarantee by a Brazil guarantor.

We have also been advised that:

   - civil actions may be brought before Brazilian courts based on the federal securities laws of
the United States and that, subject to applicable law, Brazilian courts may enforce such
liabilities in such actions against us (provided that provisions of the federal securities laws of
the United States do not contravene Brazilian public policy, good morals or national
sovereignty and provided further that Brazilian courts can assert jurisdiction over the
particular action); and

   - the ability of a judgment creditor to satisfy a judgment by attaching certain assets of the
defendant in Brazil is governed and limited by provisions of Brazilian law.

In addition, a plaintiff, whether Brazilian or non-Brazilian, who resides or is incorporated
outside Brazil or is outside Brazil during the course of the judicial litigation in Brazil and who owns
no real estate property in Brazil must post a bond to secure the payment of the defendant’s
attorney’s fees and court expenses in connection with court procedures for the collection of
payments under the notes and the guarantees except in the case of claims for collection based on
a t´ıtulo executivo extrajudicial (an instrument which may be enforced in Brazilian courts without a
review on the merits) and in the case of enforcement of foreign judgments that have been duly
confirmed by the Superior Court of Justice in Brazil.

We have been advised that, if the notes or the Indenture were to be declared void by a court
applying the laws of the State of New York, a judgment obtained outside Brazil seeking to enforce
the guarantee may not be ratified by the Superior Court of Justice in Brazil.

_Guarantees and Security Interests_

Under Brazilian law, guarantees may be either personal guarantees pursuant to which all of
the assets of a guarantor secure the relevant obligations or in rem guarantees (‘‘security’’, under
common law) pursuant to which only certain specific assets are segregated to secure an obligation.
The validity and enforceability of guarantees and security interests granted by a Brazilian subsidiary
to its parent company abroad or other Brazilian companies not subsidiary to its parent company
abroad, vis-`a-vis the Issuer hereunder may be subject to the effects of bankruptcy (falˆencia),
insolvency, judicial and out-of-court reorganization (recupera¸c˜ao judicial e extrajudicial), fraudulent
transfer or any other law of general application limiting or affecting the enforcement of contractual
or legal rights, and by the effect of general principles of Brazilian civil law, such as probity and
good faith and the social function of contracts and property.

_Guarantees_

A guarantee may be granted by a Brazilian company to guarantee obligations under the notes
or the indenture that will govern the notes, to the extent such guarantee is governed by a foreign
law, will be subject to limitations and requirements applicable to foreign agreements as mentioned
above. Furthermore, under Brazilian law, certain rights of the guarantor such as, for instance, the
right to be released of a guarantee if the guaranteed obligation is deemed null or void, cannot be
waived.

**Canada**

**_Certain Insolvency Considerations_**

Certain of the guarantors are organized under the laws of Canada (the ‘‘Canadian
guarantors’’). In the event of the insolvency of the Canadian guarantors, insolvency proceedings
may be initiated in Canada. Canadian law would govern those proceedings (subject to laws or
protocols that may be applicable to international insolvencies if proceedings also occur in other
jurisdictions in respect of those guarantors). The insolvency laws of Canada may not be as
favorable to your interests as creditors as the insolvency laws of other jurisdictions, including in
respect of priority of creditors, the ability to obtain post-filing interest and the duration of the
insolvency proceedings, and hence may limit your ability to recover payments due on the notes to
an extent exceeding the limitations arising under other insolvency laws.

In Canada, there are two primary federal statutes that govern insolvency and restructuring
proceedings of corporate debtors. The Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act (the ‘‘BIA’’) contains
provisions for the liquidation of insolvent companies in a manner loosely akin, in substance, to U.S.
chapter 7 proceedings, although there are important distinctions) and for the restructuring of
corporations (in a manner loosely akin, in substance, to U.S. chapter 11 proceedings, although
there are important distinctions). Similar to bankruptcy proceedings in the United States, a
corporate debtor may be petitioned into bankruptcy (i.e., involuntary proceedings) or file for
bankruptcy or reorganisation (i.e., voluntary proceedings). In addition to the BIA, Canada also has
the Companies’ Creditors Arrangement Act (‘‘CCAA’’), which is a restructuring statute that operates,
in practice, in a manner loosely akin to U.S. chapter 11 proceedings (with important distinctions).
CCAA proceedings are only available to insolvent debtor companies having debts in excess of
CDN$5 million. Insolvency proceedings in Canada, whether under the BIA or CCAA, are courtsupervised.

Upon the bankruptcy of a debtor corporation, whether voluntarily or upon the application of a
creditor, the BIA imposes a stay of any action, execution or other proceeding by unsecured
creditors in respect of the debtor, unless the creditors first obtain leave of the applicable court.
Upon becoming bankrupt, whether voluntarily or involuntarily, all of a debtor’s assets (subject to

299


-----

very limited exceptions) vest in a trustee in bankruptcy (subject to the rights of secured creditors
with validly perfected security interests), at which point the debtor no longer has any ability to deal
with those assets. The trustee typically proceeds to liquidate the assets and distribute the proceeds
of the assets in accordance with the provisions of the BIA.

The BIA sets out the priority scheme for the payment of claims against a bankrupt debtor,
which priority scheme takes precedence over any operative priority scheme outside of bankruptcy.
Subject to certain statutory priority claims enumerated in the BIA (including, without limitation, a
‘‘super priority’’ charge under the BIA against a debtor’s current assets for employee wages of up
to CDN$2,000 per employee), certain deemed trust claims in favour of the Crown in Right of
Canada and true trust claims, secured creditors have the right to look first to the assets charged by
their validly perfected security for payment. Thereafter, the BIA provides a list of preferred creditors
who recover their debts in priority to the general body of unsecured creditors. Preferred claims are
paid in order of their ranking, before any payments to lower ranking, preferred creditors or general
unsecured creditors. All other claims will be considered general unsecured claims and will rank pari
_passu._

The proceeds resulting from the realization of the estate of an insolvent Canadian debtor that
has guaranteed the notes may not be sufficient to satisfy any secured claims, or your deficiency
claims as unsecured creditors under the guarantees granted by the Canadian guarantor after any
prior-ranking secured creditors and other claims that rank in priority to claims of holders of notes
have been satisfied.

Corporate restructurings in Canada may be implemented under either the BIA or the CCAA
with the latter being more commonly used by larger corporations. In either case, a broad stay of
creditors’ rights and enforcement proceedings is generally implemented (in the case of the BIA by a
statutory stay, and in the case of the CCAA by a court-ordered stay). Under this protection, the
debtor will typically formulate a restructuring proposal or plan or conduct an orderly wind-down or a
sale as a going concern. In the event of a restructuring proposal or plan, a double majority of the
creditors (i.e., a simple majority in number having two-thirds in value of the claims in question)
present and voting either in person or by proxy at a meeting of creditors for each designated class
must approve the proposal or plan, and the proposal or plan must be sanctioned by the court. In
the event of a liquidation, proceeds are generally distributed in accordance with the priority
established by statute and the court (which may differ in some respects from those in a bankruptcy
under the BIA). The court may also authorize the creation of priority charges ranking ahead of other
creditors in both CCAA and BIA restructurings (for example, for debtor-in-possession financings,
directors’ and officers’ indemnification and administration costs).

The proposed treatment of creditors under the guarantees granted by the Canadian
guarantors in a restructuring proposal or plan is generally at the discretion of the Canadian
guarantors, subject to the rights of creditors affected by the proposal or plan to vote on such
proposal or plan.

Where a debtor deals with his property in a manner that prejudices its creditors (particularly
where such debtor is or becomes thereafter insolvent), such transactions by the debtor may be
subject to challenge by creditors and the scrutiny of the court. Under Canadian federal and
provincial law, there are a number of statutory means to challenge or avoid such transactions.
Where a transaction subject to review is held to be contrary to Canadian law, the transaction is
subject to be impugned and a wide variety of possible remedies may be imposed. Should the
Canadian guarantor become insolvent within applicable time periods, the granting of the guarantee
could be subject to challenge and potentially avoided, and any amounts obtained under the
guarantee in support thereof that is avoided would have to be repaid. Should the holders of the
notes be repaid or otherwise recover from the Canadian guarantor at a time when such guarantor is

300


-----

insolvent, or if the Canadian guarantor thereafter become insolvent within applicable time periods,
the repayment or recovery may be subject to challenge.

**Denmark**

**_Certain Insolvency Considerations_**

Certain of the guarantors are companies incorporated under Danish law. Accordingly,
insolvency proceedings with respect to these companies would likely proceed under and be
governed by Danish insolvency law.

Certain of the guarantors are companies incorporated under Danish law. Accordingly,
insolvency proceedings with respect to these companies would likely proceed under and be
governed by Danish insolvency law.

Danish insolvency laws are in general not as favorable to investors’ interests as the laws of the
United States or other jurisdictions with which investors are familiar. In the event that a Danish
guarantor experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of
insolvency or similar proceedings.

_Bankruptcy_

Bankruptcy (in Danish ‘‘Konkurs’’) is the principal form of proceeding in the Danish insolvency
system. In bankruptcy, the debtor’s assets are liquidated and the proceeds are distributed to the
creditors based on a priority of claims.

As a general rule, the insolvent company or any creditor of such company may present a
petition for bankruptcy. A bankruptcy requires the bankruptcy court to be satisfied that the debtor is
insolvent based on an assessment of the debtor’s liquidity status. Insolvency is pursuant to the
Danish Bankruptcy Act defined as the debtor’s inability to pay his debt as it falls due (unless the
inability is temporary). A bankruptcy petition by a creditor is barred if the creditor is adequately
protected in the event of the debtor’s insolvency by means of good and valid security. In this
context, valid security means a security right expected to provide full coverage for the creditor. If the
security is avoidable in bankruptcy or the act of perfection has not been performed, the creditor
does not have valid security The Danish bankruptcy scheme is based on the fundamental principle
of pari passu satisfaction of the debtor’s creditors. The principle is, however, to some extent
modified by the rules governing priority of debts in bankruptcy. Some claims — preferential claims
and privileged claims — rank before ordinary claims and some — the deferred claims — rank
below ordinary claims. The status of a claim is dependent upon express statutory authority (except

301


-----

for subordinated loans). Preferential claims primarily include costs and expenses involved in the
administration of the bankruptcy estate and debts approved by a supervisor during a suspension
period. Privileged claims are mainly salary claims, including salary income taxes (excluding salary
claims from the top management). It should be noted that almost all tax claims are ordinary claims.
Interest accrued on ordinary claims will rank as ordinary claims up to the date of the bankruptcy
adjudication, after which date the accrued interest will rank as a deferred claim.

Danish bankruptcy law contains several provisions enabling the trustee to initiate proceedings
to have certain transactions prior to the bankruptcy avoided. Most avoidance provisions contain
time limits, which are generally three months, but are in some cases up to two years. Payments
made by unusual means and payments made before they are due or in amounts that have had a
distinctly impairing effect on the debtor’s ability to pay its debts, are typically subject to avoidance
unless the creditor’s claim was secured in full by a good and valid security. In addition, all types of
charges, mortgages and other types of security (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, guarantees)
that were not granted to the creditor at the time the debt was incurred or that were not protected
against legal process without undue delay after the time the debt was incurred will be avoided. A
creditor who wishes to raise a claim for avoidance may do so through the trustees, who must
litigate the matter under the jurisdiction of the ordinary courts (not the bankruptcy court). As a
general rule, such legal proceedings must be initiated within twelve months after the declaration of
the bankruptcy adjudication. In the event of bankruptcy, claims in foreign currencies will be
converted into Danish kroner using the Danish National Bank’s (Nationalbanken) official exchange
rate for the relevant currency against Danish kroner as at the date of declaration of bankruptcy by
the Danish Bankruptcy Court.

If a creditor has filed a petition for bankruptcy against a debtor and the bankruptcy
requirements are not fulfilled or if the claim does not exist, then the creditor will be liable for any
loss or injury to the debtor, caused by filing of the petition.

Further, the petitioner must provide security for the expenses relating to the administration of
the bankruptcy estate. If the debtor has filed the petition for bankruptcy, the security must be
provided by the funds of the bankruptcy estate.

_Restructuring_

A bankruptcy may be preceded by a restructuring process (in Danish:
‘‘Rekonstruktionsbehandling’’). A company as well as a creditor may file an application for
restructuring with the Danish Bankruptcy Court. For the Danish Bankruptcy Court to initiate a
restructuring process it is required that the company is insolvent and that the insolvency is not
temporary. The main purpose of the restructuring is for an otherwise healthy company to overcome
the insolvency. A restructuring must involve a compulsory composition and/or a business transfer.
When a restructuring process is initiated, the Danish Bankruptcy Court will appoint a restructuring
administrator and an accountant. The administrator shall, inter alia, prepare a restructuring plan
and, together with the court-appointed accountant, a final restructuring proposal. A meeting shall be
held at the Danish Bankruptcy Court where the creditors must vote on the final restructuring
proposal. If the restructuring process does not result in a compulsory composition and/or a
business transfer that is adopted by the creditors, the Danish Bankruptcy Court will commence
bankruptcy proceedings. The restructuring will, however, be lifted if the debtor becomes solvent
during the proceedings. As a result of the restructuring the debtor will be protected against claims
for payment by his creditors during the restructuring. The company’s management will continue to
operate the company, but is not allowed to make any transactions of material importance without
the approval of the administrator. Payments to creditors will continue may only be made in
accordance with the ranking of creditors in bankruptcy or if the payment is necessary in order to
avoid losses.

**_Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of Guarantees_**

The notes will be guaranteed by the Danish subsidiaries of the Issuer. Each of the guarantees
will be limited (A) if and to the extent required to comply with Danish statutory provisions on
unlawful financial assistance and non-permitted shareholder loans including, without limitation,
Sections 206-212 of Consolidated Act No. 1089 of 14 September 2015 on public and private limited
liability companies, as amended and supplemented from time to time (the ‘‘Danish Companies
Act’’) (Lovbekendtgørelse om aktie-og anpartsselskaber (selskabsloven)), and (B) to a maximum
amount equivalent to the net equity of the Danish subsidiary granting the guarantee.

The enforceability of guarantees expressed to be granted in favour of unspecified creditors,
and for which no notice of each new creditor is given to the guarantor, has not been tested by
Danish courts.

The financial assistance must be within the distributable reserves and made on ordinary
market terms (arms’ length).

Danish law may limit a Danish guarantor ability to guarantee or provide security for the notes
to the extent that the risk of issuing the guarantee or providing the security is not balanced against
the corporate benefit (financial, commercial, strategic or otherwise) obtained by the Danish
guarantor from the issuance of the notes.

Danish law does not make any distinction between registered and beneficial ownership and if
such distinction is made under foreign law the beneficial owner will be deemed the owner under
Danish law.

The enforceability of guarantees expressed to be granted in favour of unspecified creditors,
and for which no notice of each new creditor is given to the guarantor, has not been tested by
Danish courts.

**England and Wales**

**_Certain Insolvency Considerations_**

Certain of the guarantors are incorporated under the laws of England and Wales (such
guarantors, the ‘‘English guarantors’’). Accordingly, insolvency proceedings with respect to each
English guarantor would be likely to proceed under, and be governed by, English insolvency law
(unless that company’s ‘‘centre of main interests’’ for the purposes of the EU Insolvency Regulation
is held to be in an EU Member State other than the United Kingdom in which case the laws of that
jurisdiction will, subject to certain exceptions, govern the relevant insolvency proceedings). The
Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations 2006, which implement the UNCITRAL Model Law on CrossBorder Insolvency in the U.K., provide for the recognition of both foreign main proceedings (those
taking place in the state in which the debtor has its centre of main interests) and foreign non-main
proceedings (those taking place in a state which the debtor does not have it centre of main
interests) in the courts of England and Wales.

English insolvency law is different to the laws of the United States and other jurisdictions with
which investors may be familiar. In the event that the Issuer and the English guarantors experience
financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of insolvency or similar
proceedings.

Formal insolvency proceedings under the laws of England and Wales may be initiated in a
number of ways, including by the company or a creditor making an application for administration in
or out of court, or by a creditor filing a petition to wind up the company or the company resolving
to do so (in the case of liquidation). A company may be wound up if it is unable to pay its debts,

303


-----

and may be placed into administration if it is, or is likely to become, unable to pay its debts, and
the administration is reasonably likely to achieve one of three statutory purposes (see below).

Under the Insolvency Act of 1986 (as amended) (the ‘‘Insolvency Act’’), a company is
insolvent if it is unable to pay its debts. A company is deemed unable to pay its debts if it is
insolvent on a ‘‘cash flow’’ basis (unable to pay its debts as they fall due), if it is insolvent on a
‘‘balance sheet’’ basis (the value of the company’s assets is less than the amount of its liabilities,
taking into account its contingent and prospective liabilities), or, among other matters, if it fails
either to satisfy a creditor’s statutory demand for a debt exceeding £750 or to satisfy in full a
judgment debt (or similar court order).

English insolvency laws may not be as favorable to investors as United States and other
insolvency laws. Insolvency laws and limitations on the notes and the guarantees of the notes may
adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the notes and the guarantees and may limit the
amount that can be recovered under the notes or the guarantees.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of English insolvency law relating to
certain limitations on the notes and on the guarantees. The application of these laws could
adversely affect investors, their ability to enforce their rights under the guarantees and therefore
may limit the amounts that investors may receive in an insolvency of the Issuer and/or any of the
guarantors.

_Administration, administrative receivership and floating charges_

The Insolvency Act empowers English courts to make an administration order in respect of an
English company or a company with its ‘‘centre of main interest’’ in England in certain
circumstances. An administrator can also be appointed out of court by the company, its directors or
the holder of a qualifying floating charge, and different procedures apply according to the identity of
the appointor. The purpose of an administration is comprised of three objectives that must be
looked at successively: rescuing the company as a going concern or, if that is not reasonably
practicable, achieving a better result for the company’s creditors as a whole than if the company
went into an immediate liquidation or, if neither of those objectives is reasonably practicable, and
the interests of the creditors as a whole are not unnecessarily harmed thereby, realizing property to
make a distribution to secured or preferential creditors.

During the administration, there is a statutory moratorium and in general, no proceedings or
other legal process may be commenced or continued against the debtor, or security enforced over
the company’s property, except with leave of the court or the consent of the administrator. However,
certain creditors of a company in administration may be able to realize their security over certain of
that company’s property notwithstanding the statutory moratorium. This is by virtue of the
disapplication of the moratorium in relation to a ‘‘financial collateral arrangement’’ (generally, cash
at bank or financial instruments, such as shares, bonds or tradeable capital market debt
instruments) under the Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003. If an English
guarantor were to enter administration, it is possible that the security granted by it or the guarantee
granted by it may not be enforced while it is in administration. In addition, other than in limited
circumstances, a secured creditor will not be entitled to appoint an administrative receiver (although
it may be entitled to appoint an administrator).

In order to empower a secured creditor (or its agent) to appoint an administrative receiver or
an administrator to the company out of court, the floating charge granted by the relevant English
obligor must constitute a ‘‘qualifying floating charge’’ for the purposes of English insolvency law
and, in the case of the ability to appoint an administrative receiver, the qualifying floating charge
must, unless the security document pre dates 15 September 2003, fall within one of the exceptions
in the Insolvency Act to the prohibition on the appointment of administrative receivers. In order to

304


-----

constitute a qualifying floating charge, the floating charge must be created by an instrument which
(a) states that the relevant statutory provision applies to it; (b) purports to empower the holder to
appoint an administrator of the company or (c) purports to empower the holder to appoint an
administrative receiver. The secured creditor will be the holder of a qualifying floating charge if such
floating charge security, together (if necessary) with other forms of security, relates to the whole or
substantially the whole of the property of the relevant English guarantor and at least one such
security interest is a qualifying floating charge. Whether the assets that are subject to the floating
charges and other security will constitute substantially the whole of the relevant English company’s
assets at the time that the floating charges are enforced will be a question of fact at that time.

The most relevant exception to the prohibition on the appointment of an administrative
receiver is the exception relating to ‘‘capital market arrangements’’ (as defined in the Insolvency
Act), which may apply if the issue of the notes creates a debt of at least £50.0 million for the
relevant company under the arrangement and the arrangement involves the issue of a ‘‘capital
market investment’’ (which is defined in the Insolvency Act, and includes rated, listed or traded debt
instruments, and debt instruments designed to be rated, listed or traded).

If an administrative receiver has been appointed, an administrator can only be appointed by
the court (and not by the company, its directors or the holder of a qualifying charge using the out
of court procedure), and then the court will only make an administrative order (i) the person who
appointed the administrative receiver consents or (ii) the court considers that the security pursuant
to which the administrative receiver was appointed is capable of challenge. If an administrator is
appointed, any administrative receiver will vacate office, and any receiver of part of the company’s
property must resign if required to do so by the administrator.

_Prescribed part_

An administrator, receiver (including administrative receiver) or liquidator of the company will
generally be required to ring fence a certain percentage of the proceeds of enforcement of floating
charge security for the benefit of unsecured creditors (after making full provision for preferential
creditors and expenses). Under current law, this applies to 50 per cent of the first £10,000 of
floating charge realizations and 20 per cent of the remainder over £10,000, with a maximum
aggregate cap of £600,000.

_Liquidation/winding-up_

Liquidation is a company dissolution procedure under which the assets of the company are
realized and distributed by the liquidator to creditors in the statutory order of priority prescribed by
the Insolvency Act. At the end of the liquidation process the company will normally be dissolved. In
the case of a liquidation commenced by way of a court order, no proceedings or other actions may
be commenced or continued against the company except by leave of the court and subject to such
terms as the court may impose (although security enforcement is not affected). In proceedings
where the company or its directors have resolved to place the company into liquidation, the
liquidator (or creditor or shareholder) can apply to the court for an order that no proceedings or
other actions may be commenced or continued against the company.

305


-----

Under English insolvency law, a liquidator has the power to disclaim any onerous property by
serving the prescribed notice on the relevant party. Onerous property, for these purposes, is any
unprofitable contract and any other property of the company which is unsaleable or not readily
saleable or is such that it may give rise to a liability to pay money or perform any other onerous
act. A contract may be unprofitable if it gives rise to prospective liabilities and imposes continuing
financial obligations on the company which may be regarded as detrimental to creditors. A contract
will not be unprofitable merely because it is financially disadvantageous, or because the company
could have made, or could make, a better bargain. This power can not be used to disturb accrued
rights and liabilities.

A liquidator has the power: to bring or defend legal proceedings on behalf of the company; to
carry on the business of the company as far as it is necessary for its beneficial winding up; to sell
the company’s property and execute documents in the name of the company; and to challenge
antecedent transactions.

_Priority of claims_

One of the primary functions of liquidation (and, where the company cannot be rescued as a
going concern, one of the possible functions of administration) under English law is to realize the
assets of the insolvent company and to distribute realizations made from those assets to its
creditors. Under the Insolvency Act and the Insolvency Rules 1986, creditors are placed into
different classes, with the proceeds from the realization of the insolvent company’s property applied
in descending order of priority, as set out below. With the exception of the ‘‘Prescribed part’’
(please see ‘‘—Prescribed part’’ above), distributions cannot be made to a class of creditors until
the claims of the creditors in a prior ranking class have been paid in full. Unless creditors have
agreed otherwise, distributions are made on a pari passu basis, that is, the assets are distributed in
proportion to the debts due to each creditor within a class.

The general priority of claims on insolvency is as follows (in descending order of priority):

_First ranking claims:_ holders of fixed charge security and creditors with a proprietary interest
in assets of the debtor but only to the extent of the realizations from those secured assets or with
respect to the asset in which they have a proprietary interest;

_Second ranking claims:_ expenses of the insolvent estate incurred during the relevant
insolvency proceedings (there are statutory provisions setting out the order of priority in which
expenses are paid);

_Third ranking claims:_ preferential creditors. Preferential debts include (but are not limited to)
debts owed by the insolvent company in relation to:

(i) contributions to occupational and state pension schemes;

(ii) wages and salaries of employees for work done in the four months before the insolvency
date, up to a maximum of £800 per person; and (iii) holiday pay due to any employee
whose contract has been terminated, whether the termination takes place before or after
the insolvency date.

_Fourth ranking claims:_ holders of floating charge security to the extent of the realizations from
those secured assets, according to the priority of their security. This would include any floating
charge that was stated to be a fixed charge in the document that created it but which, on a proper
interpretation, was rendered a floating charge. However, before distributing asset realizations to the
holders of floating charges, the Prescribed Part (as defined below) must be set aside for distribution
to unsecured creditors (see ‘‘—Prescribed part’’);

306


-----

_Fifth ranking claims:_ unsecured creditors. However, any secured creditor not repaid in full
from the realization of assets subject to its security can also claim the remaining debt due to it (a
shortfall) from the insolvent estate as an unsecured claim. To pay a shortfall, the officeholder can
only use realization from unsecured assets, as secured creditors are not entitled to any distribution
from the Prescribed Part in respect of a shortfall unless the Prescribed Part is sufficient to pay out
all unsecured creditors in full;

_Sixth ranking claims:_ shareholders. If after the repayment of all unsecured creditors in full,
any remaining funds exist, these will be distributed to the shareholders of the insolvent company.

_Challenges to guarantees and security_

There are circumstances under English insolvency law in which the granting by an English
guarantor of security and guarantees can be challenged. In most cases, this will only arise if the
company is placed into administration or liquidation within a specified period of the granting of the
guarantee or security. Therefore, if during the specified period an administrator or liquidator is
appointed to an English guarantor, the administrator or liquidator may challenge the validity of the
security or guarantee given by such company. The Issuer cannot be certain that, in the event that
the onset of an English guarantor’s insolvency (as described further below) is within any of the
requisite time periods set out below, the grant of a security interest or guarantee in respect of the
relevant notes would not be challenged or that a court would uphold the transaction as valid.

_Connected persons_

A connected person for the purposes of transactions at an undervalue, preferences and invalid
floating charges (as described below), is a party who is a director, shadow director, an associate of
such director, or an associate, of the relevant company. A party is associated with an individual if
they are a relative of the individual or the individual’s husband, wife or civil partner, or the husband,
wife or civil partner of a relative of the individual or the individual’s husband, wife or civil partner. A
party is associated with a company if employed by that company. A company is associated with
another company if the same person has control of both companies, or a person has control of one
and persons who are his associates, or he and persons who are his associates, have control of the
other, or if a group of two or more persons has control of each company, and the groups either
consist of the same persons or could be regarded as consisting of the same persons by treating (in
one or more cases) a member of either group as replaced by a person of whom he is an associate.

The following potential grounds for challenge may apply to any security interest or guarantee
granted by an English guarantor, include, without limitation, the following:

_Transaction at an undervalue_

Under English insolvency law, a liquidator or administrator of an English guarantor could apply
to the court for an order to set aside the creation of a security interest or a guarantee if such
liquidator or administrator believes that the creation of such security interest or guarantee
constituted a transaction at an undervalue. It will only be a transaction at an undervalue if, at the
time of the transaction or as a result of the transaction, the English company is unable to pay its
debts (as that term is defined in Section 123 of the Insolvency Act). The transaction can be
challenged if the English guarantor enters into liquidation or administration proceedings within a
period of two years from the date the English guarantor grants the security interest or the
guarantee. A transaction might be subject to being set aside as a transaction at an undervalue if
the company makes a gift to a person, if the company receives no consideration or if the company
receives consideration of significantly less value, in money or money’s worth, than the consideration
given by such company. A court, however, will not intervene if it is satisfied that the company

307


-----

entered into the transaction in good faith and for the purpose of carrying on its business and that,
at the time it did so, there were reasonable grounds for believing the transaction would benefit the
company. If the court determines that the transaction was a transaction at an undervalue, the court
can make such order as it thinks fit to restore the position to what it would have been in if the
transaction had not been entered into. In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator to
demonstrate that the English guarantor was unable to pay its debts unless a beneficiary of the
transaction was a connected person (as described above), in which case there is a presumption of
insolvency and the connected person must demonstrate the solvency of the English guarantor in
such proceedings.

_Preference_

Under English insolvency law, a liquidator or administrator of an English guarantor could apply
to the court for an order to set aside the creation of a security interest or a guarantee if such
liquidator or administrator believes that the creation of such security interest or such guarantee
constituted a preference. It will only be a preference if, at the time of the transaction or as a result
of the transaction, the English guarantor was unable to pay its debts. The transaction can be
challenged if the English guarantor enters into liquidation or administration proceedings within a
period of six months (if the beneficiary of the security or the guarantee is not a connected person)
or two years (if the beneficiary is a connected person) from the date the English guarantor grants
the security interest or the guarantee. A transaction may constitute a preference if it has the effect
of putting a creditor of the English guarantor (or a surety or guarantor for any of the company’s
debts or liabilities) in a better position (in the event of such company going into insolvent
liquidation) than such creditor, guarantor or surety would otherwise have been in had that
transaction not been entered into. If the court determines that the transaction was a preference, the
court can make such order as it thinks fit to restore the position to what it would have been in if the
preference had not been entered into. For the court to determine a preference, however, it must be
shown that the English guarantor was influenced by a desire to produce the preferential effect. In
any proceeding, it is for the administrator or liquidator to demonstrate that the English guarantor
was unable to pay its debts and that the company was influenced by a desire to produce the
preferential effect, unless the beneficiary of the transaction was a connected person, in which case
there is a presumption that the company was influenced by a desire to produce the preferential
effect and the connected person must demonstrate in such proceeding that there was no such
influence.

_Transaction defrauding creditors_

Under English insolvency law, where it can be shown that a transaction was at an undervalue
and was made for the purposes of putting assets beyond the reach of a person who is making, or
may make against the company, a claim against a company, or of otherwise prejudicing the
interests of a person in relation to the claim that that person is making or may make, the
transaction may be set aside by the court as a transaction defrauding creditors. An application to
the court for an order to set aside the transaction may be made by an administrator, a liquidator,
and subject to certain conditions, the UK Financial Conduct Authority, the UK Pensions Regulator,
and any person who claims to be prejudiced by the transaction. There is no specified time limit for
challenges in the insolvency legislation within which the challenge must be made (unlike in the
case of transactions at an undervalue or preferences) and the relevant company does not need to
be unable to pay its debts at the time of or as a result of the transaction. If the court determines
that the transaction was a transaction defrauding creditors, the court can make such orders as it
thinks fit to restore the position to what it would have been if the transaction had not been entered
into and to protect the interests of the victims of the transaction. The relevant court order may affect
the property of, or impose any obligation on, any person, whether or not he is the person with

308


-----

whom the transaction was entered into. However, such an order will not prejudice any interest in
property which was acquired from a person other than the debtor company in good faith, for value
and without notice of the relevant circumstances and will not require a person who received a
benefit from the transaction in good faith, for value and without notice of the relevant
circumstances, to pay any sum unless such person was a party to the transaction.

_Avoidance of floating charges_

Under English insolvency law, if an English company is insolvent at the time of (or as a result
of) granting a floating charge, and the floating charge was granted within the specified period
referred to below, then such floating charge is invalid except to the extent of the value of the money
paid to, or goods or services supplied to, or any discharge or reduction of any debt of, the relevant
English guarantor at the same time as or after the creation of the floating charge. The requirement
for the English guarantor to be insolvent at the time of (or as a result of) granting the floating
charge does not apply where the floating charge is granted to a connected person, and the floating
charge is granted within the specified period referred to below. If the floating charge is granted to a
connected person then the floating charge is invalid except to the extent of the value of the money
paid to, or goods or services supplied to, or any discharge or reduction of any debt of, the relevant
English guarantor at the same time as or after the creation of the floating charge, whether the
relevant English guarantor is solvent or insolvent. The transaction can be challenged if the relevant
English guarantor enters into liquidation or administration proceedings within a period of one year
(if the beneficiary is not a connected person) or two years (if the beneficiary is a connected person)
from the date the relevant English company grants the floating charge.

If the floating charge qualifies as a ‘‘financial collateral arrangement’’ under the Financial
Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003 (as amended) then the floating charge will not be
subject to challenge as described in the paragraph above.

_Foreign currency_

Under English insolvency law where creditors are asked to submit formal proofs of claim for
their debts, any debt of a company payable in a currency other than pounds sterling must be
converted into pounds sterling at the ‘‘official exchange rate’’ prevailing at the date when the
company went into liquidation or administration (if the administration was immediately preceded by
a winding up, on the date the company went into liquidation). This provision overrides any
agreement between the parties. If a creditor considers the rate determined by the office holder is
unreasonable, it may be apply to the court. If, on hearing the application, the court finds that the
rate is unreasonable, it may itself determine the rate.

**_Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of Guarantees_**

There are circumstances under English insolvency law in which the granting by an English
company of guarantees can be challenged. In most cases, this will only arise if the company is
placed into administration or liquidation within a specified period of the granting of the guarantee.
Therefore, if during the specified period an administrator or liquidator is appointed to an English
company, the administrator or liquidator may challenge the validity of the guarantee given by such
company.

For further detail on potential grounds for challenge that may apply to guarantees, see
‘‘—Insolvency proceedings and fraudulent transfer laws concerning the Issuer or any of the
guarantors in the United States or certain non-U.S. jurisdictions may adversely affect a recovery by
the holders of the notes—England and Wales’’ above.

**France**

**_Certain Insolvency Considerations_**

A number of guarantors are incorporated in France (the ‘‘French guarantors’’). Consequently,
in the event of an insolvency of any such French guarantor, insolvency proceedings may be
initiated in France. Such proceedings would then be governed by French law.

As a general rule, if the debtor is located in the European Union, in accordance with
Regulation EC 1346/2000 of 29 May 2000, French courts shall have jurisdiction to open insolvency
proceedings if the centre of the debtor’s main interests is situated in France. In the case of a
company or legal person, the place of the registered office shall be presumed to be the centre of
its main interests in the absence of proof to the contrary.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of insolvency law in France.

French laws and proceedings affecting creditors include the civil law rescheduling of debt set
out by article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code (code civil), court-assisted pre-insolvency
proceedings (mandat ad hoc or conciliation proceedings) and court-administered insolvency
proceedings being either safeguard (sauvegarde), accelerated safeguard (sauvegarde acc´el´er´ee),
accelerated financial safeguard (sauvegarde financi`ere acc´el´er´ee), reorganisation or liquidation
proceedings (redressement or liquidation judiciaire).

French insolvency law changed as a result of Ordinance No. 2014-326 of March 12, 2014
relating to the reform of the prevention of corporate difficulties and of insolvency proceedings
(‘‘Ordinance No. 2014-326’’), which came into force on July 1, 2014 (it being specified that it does
not apply to proceedings ongoing at that date) and which was supplemented by Order of July 25,
2014 (‘‘Order of July 25, 2014’’), Decree No. 2014-736 of June 30 (‘‘Decree No. 2014-736’’), 2014
and Ordinance No. 2014-1088 of September 26, 2014 (‘‘Ordinance No. 2014-1088’’). Recently,
certain aspects of French insolvency proceedings have been modified pursuant to Law
No. 2015-990 of August 6, 2015 for growth, business and equal opportunities (‘‘Law
No. 2015-990’’). Law No. 2016-1547 of November 18, 2016 (‘‘Law No. 2016-1547’’) (it being
specified that the latter does not apply to proceedings opened before November 20, 2016) and Law
No. 2016-1691 of December 9, 2016 (it being specified that the latter does not apply to
proceedings opened before December 11, 2016).

_Pre-insolvency Measures and Proceedings_

Pursuant to article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code, French courts may, in any civil proceeding
involving the debtor, whether initiated by the debtor or the creditor, taking into account the debtor’s
financial position and the creditor’s financial needs, defer or otherwise reschedule the payment
dates of payment obligations over a maximum period of two years. In addition, pursuant to
article 1343-5, if a debtor specifically initiates proceedings therefore, French courts may decide that
any amounts, the payment date of which is thus deferred or rescheduled, will bear interest at a rate
which is lower than the contractual rate (but not lower than the legal rate) and/or that payments
made shall first be allocated to repayment of the principal. If a court order under article 1343-5 of
the French Civil Code is made, it will suspend any pending enforcement measures, and any
contractual interest or penalty for late payment will not accrue or be due during the period ordered
by the court.

A debtor company may request, in its sole discretion, that the court appoints an ad hoc agent
_(mandataire ad hoc) if it finds itself in financial difficulties but is not yet unable to pay its due debts_
out of its available assets (in a state of cessation des paiements). The ad hoc agent’s duties are
determined by the court. Such ad hoc agents are usually appointed in order to facilitate the
negotiations with creditors but they cannot coerce the creditors to accept any proposals. Ordinance

310


-----

No. 2014-326 provides that the order appointing the mandataire ad hoc shall be notified for
information purposes to the debtor auditors (if any).

A company may also initiate, in its sole discretion, a conciliation proceeding, which is another
voluntary non-judicial amicable settlement of debts proceeding provided it (i) is not unable to pay
its due debts out of its available assets (in a state of cessation des paiements) for more than
45 days and (ii) experiences legal, economic or financial difficulties, currently or in the foreseeable
future. At the request of the company, the competent court will enter an order appointing a
conciliator (conciliateur) for a maximum period of four months, renewable at the conciliator’s
request provided that the total duration does not exceed five months, and whose role is to help the
company reach agreement with its creditors for reducing or rescheduling its indebtedness in order
to resolve its difficulties. Unlike under the former r`eglement amiable, the conciliator no longer has
the power to petition the court to grant an automatic stay of proceedings and claims. The
agreement reached by the company with its major creditors can be either acknowledged by the
President of the court (constatation) or approved (homologation) by the court. If the agreement is
merely acknowledged, it allows the agreement to become enforceable (by giving it the force
_ex´ecutoire) as against the signatories. Approval of the agreement by the court requires (i) that the_
company is not in a state of cessation des paiements or that such state has ceased by reason of
the conclusion of the agreement with the creditors, (ii) that the terms of the agreement allow the
company to continue in business and (iii) that the agreement does not negatively affect the rights of
the creditors who are not a party thereto. The approval of the agreement makes the proceedings
public. In addition, creditors who provide new money or goods or services designed to ensure the
continuation of the business of the distressed company (other than shareholders providing new
equity and creditors who extended credit prior to the beginning of the conciliation) will enjoy a
priority of payment over all pre-proceeding and post-proceeding claims (except as regards certain
post-proceeding employment claims and procedural costs), in the case of subsequent insolvency
proceedings (proc´edure de sauvegarde, redressement judiciaire or liquidation judiciaire). Besides,
Law No. 2016-1547 provides that the creditors committees to be set up in the framework of
insolvency proceedings shall not be entitled to impose a rescheduling or a postponement of the
debts benefiting from a ‘‘conciliation/new money’’ privilege or a waiver on part of such debt without
the express approval of the creditors benefiting from the ‘‘conciliation/new money’’ privilege.

Ordinance No. 2014-326 has amended the provisions governing the mandat ad hoc and
conciliation proceedings as follows:

   - the conciliator may be entrusted, at the request of the debtor and after consultation of the
participating creditors, with the mission of setting up a partial or total sale of the business
that could be subsequently implemented in the context of further safeguard, reorganisation
or liquidation proceedings, if required. Any offers received in the context of the mandat ad
_hoc or the conciliation may be directly submitted to the court in the context of_
reorganisation or liquidation proceedings after consultation of the public prosecutor
(Article L 642-2 of the French Commercial Code, as amended by Ordinance No. 2014-326);

   - where a conciliation agreement has been acknowledged by the President of the court or
sanctioned by the court, said President of the court or the court may appoint the conciliator
as a representative in charge of the implementation of said agreement;

   - the judge having commenced conciliation proceedings may, during the execution period of
a conciliation agreement, impose grace periods on creditors having participated in the
conciliation proceedings (other than the tax and social security administrations) for their
claims that were not dealt with in the conciliation agreement;

   - so long as the conciliation agreement is in effect, interest produced by the affected claims
can no longer be capitalised;

311


-----

   - the ‘‘new money’’ privilege may also benefit to new financing granted during conciliation
proceedings should they end up on a conciliation agreement that is approved by the court;
and

   - two types of contractual provisions are deemed null and void: (i) any provision that modifies
the conditions for the continuation of an ongoing contract by reducing the debtors’ rights or
increasing its obligations simply by reason of the designation of a mandataire ad hoc or of
the commencement of conciliation proceedings or of a request submitted to this end and
(ii) any provision forcing the debtor to bear, by reason only of the appointment of a
_mandataire ad hoc or of the commencement of conciliation proceedings, the fees of the_
professional advisers whom the creditor shall have retained in connection with these
proceedings for the portion exceeding the proportion specified by Decree of July 25, 2014
(which sets the maximum amount of advisory fees that can be borne by debtors at 75% of
these fees).

The approval of the agreement, as well as its acknowledgment, suspends any ongoing legal
actions against the debtor brought by creditors who are a party to the agreement. A third party
which has granted a guarantee (sˆuret´e personnelle) can benefit from the provisions of the approved
or acknowledged agreement.

_Insolvency Proceedings_

**Safeguard Procedure (proc´edure de sauvegarde)**

The safeguard procedure allows for the establishment of a restructuring plan negotiated with
the creditors under court supervision before the company becomes insolvent. It is available only at
the request of a debtor company, which is not in a state of cessation des paiements, experiencing
difficulties that cannot be overcome. Law No. 2016-1547 obliges the Court to recommend the
opening of a conciliation instead of a safeguard procedure to the debtor company that is facing
financial difficulties, which are however manageable. Pursuant to the opening judgment of the
safeguard procedure, both a creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire), who shall represent
the creditors, and a judicial receiver (administrateur judiciaire), who shall assist the managers of the
company, shall be appointed. Law No. 2015-990 provides that two of such creditors’ representatives
or receivers may be appointed if the debtor or the public prosecutor requests so or, subject to
certain thresholds being met, at the court’s discretion. The safeguard proceedings are public and
include an automatic stay against creditors for up to six months, renewable for an additional six
months with court approval and which can be extended to a maximum of 18 months upon request
of the public prosecutor. During the safeguard procedure, payments by the debtor of any debts
incurred prior to the opening of the procedure are prohibited, subject to limited exceptions. The
bankruptcy judge can authorise payments for prior debts in order to discharge a lien on property
needed for the continued operation of the business or get back goods or rights transferred as
collateral in a fiduciary estate (patrimoine fiduciaire). Debts arising after the commencement of the
safeguard procedure will be given priority over debts incurred prior to the commencement of the
safeguard procedure if they relate to expenses necessary for the business’s ordinary activities or
are for the requirements of the procedure. One of the main features of the safeguard procedure
consists in the creation of two creditors’ committees (mandatory for companies employing more
than 150 persons or with a turnover exceeding e20 million, optional below such thresholds), one
consisting of banks and financial institutions and the other of suppliers, and a general meeting of
bondholders in the event the concerned French company would have issued bonds, to which the
debtor submits proposals to reach agreement on a recovery plan. The committees must accept or
reject proposals for a plan within 20 to 30 days of such proposals. This time limit may be modified
at the request of the debtor or the judicial receiver, but cannot be less than 15 days. The plan is
approved where members of each committee voting in favour of the plan account for at least

312


-----

two-thirds of the outstanding claims of the creditors expressing a vote. In cases where bonds have
been issued by the concerned French company, the plan, if approved by the committees, is then
submitted to the general meeting of bondholders (a majority of two-thirds of the outstanding claims
of the bondholders expressing a vote). The committees and the general meeting of bondholders, if
any, shall vote on the plan within six months from the date of the judgement opening the
procedure. The plan submitted to the committees and the bondholders, if any, may include the
rescheduling of debts but also the cancellation of debts and debt-for equity swaps. Following
approval by the creditors’ committees and the general meeting of bondholders, if any, and subject
to verification by the court that creditors’ interests are adequately preserved, the court can approve
the plan, in which case the plan will be binding on dissenting members of the committee although
not on creditors who are not members of one of the committees and who are not bondholders.

With respect to creditors who are not members of committees and who are not bondholders,
individual agreements will be negotiated. For those individual creditors who have not reached a
negotiated agreement, the court can reschedule repayment of their debts over a maximum period
of ten years, except for debts with maturity dates of more than ten years, in which case the maturity
date will remain the same. The court cannot oblige such creditor to waive part of its claim. The first
payment must be made within a year of the judgement adopting the plan (in the third and
subsequent year, the amount of each annual installment must be of at least 5% of the total amount
of the debt).

The court can also impose a plan if one or both of the committees, or the general meeting of
bondholders, does not approve the debtor company’s proposed plan, either by failing to act within
the specified six-month period or by rejecting it. In such a case, the rules are the same as the one
applicable to creditors who are outside committees and who are not bondholders (in particular, the
court can only impose a rescheduling of the repayment of the debts over a maximum period of ten
years).

Ordinance No. 2014-326 provides that the court will not be able to impose a rescheduling or a
postponement of the debts benefiting from a ‘‘new money’’ privilege.

At any time during safeguard proceedings, the court may convert such proceedings into
reorganisation if the debtor becomes insolvent or at the debtor’s request, if the approval of a
safeguard plan is obviously impossible and if the company would become insolvent should
safeguard proceedings end. Ordinance No. 2014-326 also assigned this prerogative to the judicial
receiver, the creditors’ representative and to the public prosecutor when a safeguard or
reorganisation plan has not been adopted. At any time during safeguard or reorganisation
proceedings, the court may convert such proceedings into liquidation proceedings if the debtor is
insolvent and its recovery is obviously impossible. However, further to recent decisions from the
French Constitutional Court dated December 7, 2012 and March 7, 2014), the constitutionality of the
conversion of safeguard proceedings into judicial reorganisation or liquidation proceedings, when it
is decided upon the judge’s own initiative, may be challenged.

In this respect, Ordinance No. 2014-326 took into consideration the aforementioned decision
by removing the provisions authorising the opening of any insolvency proceedings upon the
judge’s own initiative (i.e., Articles L.621-2, L631.3, L.640-3, L.640-4 and L.640-5 of the French
Commercial Code).

However, some of the provisions governing safeguard or reorganisation plan have been
amended by Ordinance No. 2014-326 as follows:

   - all members of the creditors’ committees (for the avoidance of doubt, this excludes the
bondholders’ assembly) will have the possibility to propose an alternative plan. The

313


-----

committees will be required to vote on the different plans which will each be the subject of a
report of the judicial receiver; and

   - each member of the creditors’ committees must inform the judicial receiver of the existence
of any subordination agreement, any agreement restricting or conditioning their vote and
any agreement allowing for third party payment of the relevant debt. The judicial
administrator shall then submit to the creditor/note holder as proposal for the computation
of its voting rights in the creditors committee/bondholders general meeting. In the event of a
disagreement, the creditor/note holder or the judicial receiver may request that the matter be
decided by the president of the commercial court in summary proceedings.

**Accelerated Safeguard (sauvegarde acc´el´er´ee) and Accelerated Financial Safeguard**
**Procedure (sauvegarde financi`ere acc´el´er´ee)**

Pursuant to Ordinance No. 2014-326, as from July 1, 2014, a debtor facing difficulties that it is
not in a position to overcome may request commencement of Accelerated Safeguard proceedings
(proc´edure de sauvegarde acc´el´er´ee) as long as it is subject to ongoing conciliation proceedings
and provided that it is not insolvent or it has not been insolvent (en ´etat de cessation des
_paiements) for more than 45 days prior to the request for the commencement of conciliation_
proceedings. The debtor must have prepared a draft safeguard plan (i) ensuring the continuation of
its business as a going concern and (ii) supported by enough of the creditors involved in the
proceedings to render likely its adoption by a two-thirds majority within a maximum of three months
of the commencement of the proceedings.

Such proceedings are available to debtors (i) who published accounts certified by an auditor
and meet one of the thresholds set by Decree No. 2014-736 (either (a) more than 20 employees, or
(b) a turnover greater than e3 million or (c) whose balance sheet exceeds e1.5 million) or (ii) who
published consolidated accounts.

Unlike Accelerated Financial Safeguard (sauvegarde financi`ere acc´el´er´ee), such proceedings
also include non-financial creditors and the competent court must approve any restructuring plan
within three months of the date on which the Accelerated Safeguard proceedings have been
commenced.

Accelerated Safeguard proceedings only apply to creditors involved in said proceedings: the
other creditors are not directly impacted by such proceedings; their debts will continue to be due
and payable according to their contractual or legal terms.

The list of claims of creditors involved in the conciliation proceedings shall be drawn up by the
debtor and certified by the statutory auditor and shall be deemed to constitute the filing of such
claims for the purpose of the Accelerated Safeguard proceedings (see below) unless the creditors
otherwise elect to make such a filing (see below).

The total duration of the Accelerated Safeguard proceedings (i.e., the period between the
judgment commencing the Accelerated Safeguard proceedings and the judgment adopting the
plan) is three months. If a plan is not adopted by the creditors and approved by the court within
such deadline, the court shall terminate the proceedings.

A debtor facing difficulties that it is not in a position to overcome may also request
commencement of Accelerated Financial Safeguard proceedings as long as it is subject to ongoing
_conciliation proceedings and provided that it is not insolvent or it has not been insolvent (en ´etat de_
_cessation des paiements) for more than 45 days prior to the request for the commencement of_
conciliation proceedings.

314


-----

The Accelerated Financial Safeguard procedure has been designed to ‘‘fast-track’’ purely
financial difficulties of debtors (i) who published accounts certified by an auditor and meet certain
thresholds set by Decree No. 2014-736 (either (a) more than 20 employees, or (b) a turnover
greater than e3 million or (c) whose balance sheet exceeds e1.5 million) or (ii) who published
consolidated accounts.

The debtor must have prepared a draft safeguard plan (i) ensuring the continuation of its
business as a going concern and (ii) supported by enough of its financial creditors (i.e., credit
institutions and bondholders) to render likely its adoption by a two-thirds majority of its financial
creditors within a maximum of two months of the commencement of the proceedings.

Accelerated Financial Safeguard proceedings apply only to debt owed to financial institutions
and bondholders (i.e., debts towards. credit institutions and bond debt) the payment of which is
suspended by the plan adopted through the Accelerated Financial Safeguard proceedings, other
debts (such as trade debt) continuing to be paid in the ordinary course of business. As to financial
creditors, the debtor will be prohibited from paying any amounts in connection with the finance
documents that fall due during the observation period. Should interest fall due during the
observation period, it may be paid only after the judgment of the Commercial Court approving the
safeguard plan and in accordance with its terms. Creditors other than financial creditors (such as
public creditors, the tax or social security administration and suppliers) are not directly impacted by
Accelerated Financial Safeguard proceedings. Their debts will continue to be due and payable
according to their contractual or legal terms.

The list of claims of credit institutions and bondholders party to the conciliation proceedings
shall be drawn up by the debtor and certified by the statutory auditor and shall be deemed to
constitute the filing of such claims for the purpose of the Accelerated Financial Safeguard
proceedings (see below) unless the creditors otherwise elect to make such a filing (see below).

The total duration of the Accelerated Financial Safeguard proceedings (i.e., the period
between the judgment commencing the Accelerated Financial Safeguard proceedings and the
judgment adopting the plan) is one month, unless the court decides to extend it by one additional
month. If a plan is not adopted by the creditors and approved by the court within such deadlines,
the court shall terminate the proceedings.

**Judicial Reorganisation (redressement judiciaire)**

A judicial reorganisation may be initiated with respect to a company incorporated in France if
it cannot pay its due debts out of its available assets (it is in cessation des paiements) provided its
financial situation is capable of improving.

Such proceedings may be initiated by the company, a creditor or the public prosecutor.

Pursuant to the judicial reorganisation opening judgment, both a creditors’ representative
(mandataire judiciaire) who shall represent the creditors and a judicial receiver (administrateur
_judiciaire) who shall assist the managers of the company shall be appointed. Law No. 2015-990_
provides that two of such creditors’ representatives or receivers may be appointed if the debtor or
the public prosecutor requests so or, subject to certain thresholds being met, at the court’s
discretion.

The debtor is required to petition for insolvency proceedings within 45 days of becoming in
_cessation des paiements unless it initiated a conciliation procedure within the same period. If it_
does not, directors and, as the case may be, de facto managers, are subject to civil liability. The
court sets the date of cessation des paiements. Failing such determination, the date of cessation
_des paiements is deemed to be the date of the court order acknowledging that the company has_
ceased its payments. However, in the order commencing proceedings or in a subsequent order, a

315


-----

court may set the date of the cessation des paiements at an earlier date of up to 18 months prior to
the court order acknowledging that the company ceased its payments. Except for fraud, the date of
the cessation des paiements may not be fixed at an earlier date than the date of the final court
decision which approved an amicable settlement (homologation) in the context of a conciliation
procedure. The date of cessation des paiements is important because it marks the beginning of the
suspect period. Certain transactions undertaken during the suspect period may become void or
voidable.

Judicial reorganisation is intended to allow the debtor company to write down its debts and
continue operations. Creditors’ committees are established and a plan is prepared in accordance
with the rules applicable to the safeguard procedure.

If it appears the debtor is not able to ensure the recovery of its business, a total or partial sale
of the business can be ordered by the court, at the request of the judicial receiver. In this case, the
sale is conducted by the judicial receiver, if one has been appointed, or the creditors’ representative
(mandataire judiciaire) in accordance with rules applicable to the liquidation procedure.

Pursuant to new article L. 631-19-2 of the French commercial code introduced by Law
No. 2015-990, the court is being vested, with the power to impose a share capital increase or a
sale of shares on the shareholders of the debtor company, provided the following conditions are
met:

   - the company shall employ more than 150 persons or be the parent company of a group of
companies which employs more than 150 persons

   - the liquidation of the company shall result in a serious trouble to the national, regional or
local economy and to the local employment area; and

   - there shall be no available alternative to the share capital increase or sale of shares as
envisioned under the proposed recovery plan.

In this situation, the Court, upon request of the judicial receiver or public prosecutor, may
decide, as from the end of a three-month period which has begun as at the opening date of the
proceedings, to:

   - appoint an ad hoc representative who will have to vote in favour of the share capital
increase instead of the opposing shareholders (the amount of such share capital increase
shall be equal to the one set forth under the recovery plan); or

   - sell some or all the shares held by the opposing shareholders who have at least a blocking
minority to the benefit of the persons who has committed to perform the recovery plan.
Such persons shall then offer to all shareholders to purchase their shares of the company.
The other shareholders would then benefit from a right to withdraw from the company
(i.e., sell their shares).

Article L.631-9-1 of the French Commercial Code entitles the judicial receiver to claim for the
appointment of an ad hoc representative before the Court in the event the net equity of the debtor
company has not been restored in accordance with Article L.626-3 of the French Commercial Code
(i.e. convening of a shareholders meeting to vote on increase or decrease of the share capital
and/or amendments of the Bylaws, it being specified that if the net equity is less than half the
amount of the share capital, the shareholders shall first restore such net equity). This courtappointed ad hoc representative will be in charge of convening a shareholders’ meeting and vote in
favor of the restoration of the net equity in lieu of the shareholders, for the amount that he/she will
be necessary.

316


-----

_Judicial Liquidation (liquidation judiciaire)_

Such proceedings may be initiated by the company, a creditor or the public prosecutor.

Pursuant to the opening judgment of the judicial liquidation proceedings, a liquidator
(‘‘liquidateur’’) shall be appointed. Law No. 2015-990 provides that two of such judicial liquidators
may be appointed by the court subject to certain thresholds being met. Judicial liquidation would
be applicable to any debtor company (i) that has ceased payments; (ii) that the court deems the
recovery is obviously impossible. Debtors are required to file for liquidation within 45 days of
ceasing payments if they do not request conciliation or judicial reorganisation. In judicial liquidation,
the sole remedy is a sale of the company, either in whole or in part.

As a result of French Constitutional Court decisions (December 7, 2012 n�2012 286 QPC;
March 7, 2014, n� 2013 368 QPC; March 7, 2014, n� 2013 372 QPC; June 6, 2014, n�2014-399), the
French Commercial Code was amended by Ordinance No. 2014-326 and Ordinance
No. 2014-1088. Pursuant to these ordinances, the Court can no longer rule at its own initiative
(i) the commencement of judicial reorganisation proceedings, (ii) the commencement of judicial
liquidation proceedings, (iii) the termination of the safeguard plan and subsequent commencement
of reorganisation or judicial liquidation proceedings, (iv) the conversion of safeguard proceedings
into judicial reorganisation proceedings, or (v) the re-opening of liquidation proceedings after they
were closed due to an insufficiency of assets (insuffisance d’actif).

_Void and Voidable Transactions_

Void transactions include transactions or payments entered into during the suspect period that
may constitute voluntary preferences for the benefit of some creditors to the detriment of other
creditors. These include transfers of assets for no consideration, contracts under which the
reciprocal obligations of the company significantly exceed those of the other party, payments of
debts not due at the time of payment, payments made in a manner which is not commonly used in
the ordinary course of business, security granted for debts previously incurred, any provisional
measures, unless the writ of attachment or seizure predates the date of cessation des paiements,
any operations relating to stock options, any fiduciary transfers (unless the transfer is made as a
security for an indebtedness entered into simultaneously) and modifications to existing fiduciary
transfers securing previous debts and any declaration of non-seizability (d´eclaration
_d’insaisissabilit´e) that occurred during the suspect period._

Voidable transactions include transactions or payments for debts due made from the date of
_cessation des paiements, if the party dealing with the company knew that it was in a state of_
_cessation des paiements. Transactions relating to the transfer of assets for no consideration are_
also voidable when realised during the six-month period prior to the beginning of the suspect
period.

_Status of Creditors_

As a general rule, creditors domiciled in France whose debts arose prior to the
commencement of the proceedings must file a claim with the creditors’ representative within two
months of the publication of the court order in the Bulletin Officiel des Annonces Civiles et
_Commerciales; this period is extended to four months for creditors domiciled outside France. In_
certain circumstances, other time limits apply. Creditors who have not submitted their claims during
the relevant period are barred from receiving distributions made in connection with the proceedings
and their unasserted claims are extinguished. Employees are not subject to such limits and are
preferential creditors under French law.

317


-----

In Accelerated Financial Safeguard proceedings, as well as in Accelerated Safeguard, the
debts held by financial creditors that took part in the conciliation negotiation are listed by the debtor
and certified by its statutory auditor (or, in its absence, its accountant). Although such creditors can
file proofs of claim pursuant to the regular process, they may also avail themselves of this simplified
alternative and merely adjust the amounts of their claims as set forth on the list prepared by the
debtor (within the two or four months’ time limit). Those creditors who did not take part in the
conciliation proceeding would have to file their proofs of claim within the aforementioned legal time
limit. In Accelerated Financial Safeguard, debts owed to creditors other than banks, financial
institutions or bondholders should be paid in the ordinary course. Furthermore, pursuant to
Ordinance No. 2014-326, where the debtor has reported a claim to the creditors’ representative, it is
presumed to have acted on behalf of the relevant creditor. The creditors are nevertheless
recommended to file a proof of claim, in particular if they disagree with the amount reported by the
debtor and/or the guarantees attached to their claim.

From the date of the court order commencing the insolvency proceedings (sauvegarde,
_redressement or liquidation judiciaire procedures), the company is prohibited from paying debts_
outstanding prior to that date, subject to specified exceptions, which essentially concern the set-off
of interrelated debts and payments made to recover assets for which recovery is justified by the
continued operation of the business provided that such payments are authorised by the court.
During this period, creditors may not pursue any legal action against the company with respect to
any claim arising prior to the court order commencing the proceedings if the objective of such legal
action is:

(a) to obtain an order for or payment of a sum of money by the company to the creditor
(however, the creditor may require that a court fix the amount due); or

(b) to terminate a contract for non-payment of amounts owed by the company; or to enforce
the creditor’s rights against any assets of the company.

Contractual provisions that would accelerate the payment of the company’s obligations upon
the occurrence of (i) the opening of safeguard or judicial reorganisation proceedings or (ii) a state
of cessation des paiements, are not enforceable under French law. The opening of liquidation
proceedings, however, automatically accelerates the maturity of the company’s obligations. If,
however, the court authorises the company to continue its activity because a sale of all or part of
the business is feasible, the company’s obligations which have not yet arrived at maturity shall only
mature as at the date of the judgement ordering such sale.

In addition, during the observation period:

   - accrual of interest is suspended (except in respect of loans providing for a term of at least
one year, or contracts providing for a payment which is differed by at least one year);

   - the debtor is prohibited from paying debts incurred prior to the date of the court decision
commencing the proceedings, subject to specified exceptions which essentially cover the
set-off of related (connexes) debts and payments authorised by the insolvency judge to
recover assets for which recovery is justified by the continued operation of the business;

   - creditors may not pursue any individual legal action against the debtor (or, in safeguard
proceedings, against a guarantor of the debt provided such guarantor is an individual) with
respect to any claim arising prior to the court decision commencing the proceedings if the
objective of such legal action is:

     - to obtain an order for payment of a sum of money by the debtor to the creditor
(however, the creditor may require that a court determine the amount due);

318


-----

     - to terminate a contract for non-payment of pre-petition amounts owed to the creditor;
or

      - to enforce the creditor’s rights against any assets of the debtor, except where such
asset — whether tangible or intangible, moveable or immoveable — is located in
another member State within the European Union, in which case the rights in rem of
creditors thereon would not be affected by the insolvency procedure, in accordance
with the terms of article 5 of EC Regulations 1346/2000.

Ordinance No. 2014-326 provides that all interest resulting from loan contracts having a
duration of one year or more, or contracts having a deferred payment of one year or more, can no
longer be capitalised as of the opening judgment.

In the current Accelerated Financial Safeguard, proceedings, as well as in the Accelerated
Safeguard, the above rules only apply to the creditors that took part in the conciliation proceedings.

The judicial receiver may elect to terminate or continue ongoing contracts (contrats en cours)
provided that the company fully performs its post-petition contractual obligations. The requirement
of immediate cash payment for services rendered pursuant to an ongoing contract, absent consent
to other terms of payment, will only continue to apply in the context of reorganisation or liquidation
proceedings.

French insolvency law assigns priority to the payment of certain preferred creditors, including
employees, officials appointed by the insolvency court, creditors who, as part of a sanctioned
conciliation agreement, have provided new money or goods or services (the ‘‘new money
privilege’’), certain pre-petition secured creditors in judicial liquidation proceedings only,
post-petition creditors, the French State (taxes and social charges), other pre-petition secured
creditors and pre-petition unsecured creditors.

Notwithstanding the above, the opening of collective insolvency proceedings may trigger
further consequences pursuant to Ordinance No. 2014-326:

   - the opening judgment renders due and payable all unpaid capital of the debtor and the
creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire) may demand that a shareholder to pay its
portion of the unpaid capital; or

if the court gives a mandate to the judicial receiver to convene any shareholder meeting to
adopt any modifications required by the safeguard plan, the court can order that upon the first
convening, the decisions will be adopted by a majority of the shareholders present or represented
at the meeting as long as such shareholders own at least half of the shares with voting rights.

**_Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of Guarantees_**

The grant of a guarantee by a French company for the obligations of another group company
must be for the corporate benefit of the granting company.

The question of corporate benefit must be determined on a case-by-case basis and
consideration has to be given to any direct and/or indirect (group) benefit that the company would
derive from the transaction. When the benefit is not a direct one, French case law, which is however
not clearly settled, has set a number of criteria to uphold a ‘‘group exemption’’, which may
summarised as follows (i) the group must have a ‘‘group policy’’, (ii) the guarantee must be for a
reasonable consideration, (iii) the guarantee must maintain a balance between the financial
commitments of the concerned affiliates and (iv) the financial support granted by the company
should not exceed its financial capabilities.

319


-----

If the corporate benefit requirement is not met, the directors and/or shareholders of the
company may be held liable for breach of their fiduciary duties, and, under certain circumstances,
the guarantee could be declared null and void.

In order to enable French subsidiaries to grant a guarantee in respect of liabilities of a direct
or indirect parent or sister company without the risk of being in breach of French rules on corporate
benefit, it is standard market practice for indentures, credit agreements and guarantees to contain
so-called ‘‘limitation language’’ in relation to subsidiaries incorporated or established in France.
Accordingly, the indenture that will govern the notes will contain such limitation language and the
guarantees of the French guarantors will be so limited.

**Germany**

**_Certain Insolvency Considerations_**

Certain guarantors are incorporated in Germany and have their centre of main interest in
Germany (such guarantors, the ‘‘German guarantors’’). Consequently, in the event of an insolvency
of any such German guarantor, insolvency proceedings may be initiated in Germany. Such
proceedings would then be governed by German law.

Under German law, insolvency proceedings can be initiated either by the debtor or by a
creditor in the event of over-indebtedness (Uberschuldung[¨] ) or illiquidity (Zahlungsunf¨ahigkeit) of the
debtor. After the occurrence of either over-indebtedness or illiquidity, a managing director of a
German legal entity or a German partnership with, directly or indirectly, no natural person as fully
liable partner is obligated to file for insolvency proceedings immediately (with the possibility that if it
is more likely than not to cure the over-indebtedness or illiquidity within three weeks, this period
may be used for the cure). The debtor is over-indebted if its liabilities exceed the market value of its
assets, but, the debtor is in any case not over-indebted in terms of German insolvency law if its
continuation as a going concern is more likely than its liquidation based on a two-year forecast
horizon. The debtor is illiquid if it is unable to pay 10% or more of its debts as and when they fall
due for a period longer than three weeks. In addition, the debtor can (but is not obligated to) file for
insolvency proceedings if it is imminently at risk to be unable to pay its debts as and when they fall
due (drohende Zahlungsunf¨ahigkeit). The insolvency proceedings are court-controlled and the court
opens the insolvency proceedings if certain formal requirements are met and if there are sufficient
assets to cover at least the costs of the proceedings. To determine if that is the case, a preliminary
insolvency proceeding is initiated and a preliminary insolvency administrator (Vorl¨aufiger
_Insolvenzverwalter) (or preliminary supervising trustee (Vorl¨aufiger Sachwalter), in the case of_
preliminary debtor-in-possession proceeding (Vorl¨aufige Eigenverwaltung)) is appointed. If the assets
of the debtor are not expected to be sufficient, the insolvency court will open main insolvency
proceedings only if third parties, (e.g. creditors) advance the costs themselves. In the absence of
such third party advancement of funds, the petition for opening of insolvency proceedings will
usually be rejected due to lack of sufficient assets (Abweisung mangels Masse). If insolvency
proceedings are commenced, the court appoints an insolvency administrator who has full power to
dispose of the debtor’s assets which constitute the estate, whereas the debtor is no longer entitled
to dispose of those assets. Alternatively, the court can, upon request, authorise the debtor to
administer and dispose of the insolvency estate under the supervision of a custodian
(Eigenverwaltung unter Aufsicht eines Sachwalters). If, as part of the preliminary proceeding, a
preliminary creditors’ committee (Vorl¨aufiger Gl¨aubigerausschuss) has been constituted, the court
may only appoint an administrator against the unanimous recommendation of the preliminary
creditors’ committee if the recommended administrator is unsuited to fulfil the duties of an
administrator. In addition, the first creditors’ assembly (Gl¨aubigerversammlung) can change the
administrator by vote.

320


-----

Any person that has a right for segregation of assets (Aussonderung), i.e., the relevant asset of
this person does not constitute part of the insolvency estate, does not participate in the insolvency
proceedings; the claim for segregation must be enforced in the course of ordinary court
proceedings against the insolvency administrator. All other creditors, whether secured or unsecured
(unless they have a right to segregate an asset from the insolvency estate (Aussonderungsrecht) as
opposed to a preferential right (Absonderungsrecht) who wish to assert claims against the debtor
need to participate in the insolvency proceedings.

Any individual enforcement action (with some exceptions, e.g., for security rights in real estate)
brought against the debtor by any of its creditors other than certain creditors with preferred claims
(Absonderung der Masseverbindlichkeit) is subject to an automatic stay once insolvency
proceedings have been opened. Secured creditors are generally not entitled to enforce their
security interests outside the insolvency proceedings. However, secured creditors have certain
preferential rights. The enforcement proceeds minus certain contributory charges for (i) assessing
the value of the secured assets and (ii) realising the secured assets (Verwertungskosten) are paid to
the creditor holding a security interest in the relevant collateral up to an amount equal to its
secured claims. Remaining amounts are distributed among the secured creditors to the extent they
have not realised their claim by preferred liquidation and unsecured creditors. If the German
guarantors grant security to creditors other than the holders of the notes over their assets, such
security may result in a preferred treatment of creditors secured by such security. The proceeds
resulting from such collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy the holders of the notes under the
guarantees granted by the German guarantors after such secured creditors have been satisfied. A
different distribution of enforcement proceeds can be proposed in an insolvency plan
(Insolvenzplan) that can be submitted by the debtor or the insolvency administrator and requires the
consent of the debtor as well as the consent of each class of creditors in accordance with specific
majority rules.

_Hardening Periods and Fraudulent Transfer_

In the event of insolvency proceedings with respect to a German guarantor, which would most
likely be based on and governed by the insolvency laws of Germany, the guarantee provided by
that entity could be subject to potential challenges (Anfechtung) by an insolvency administrator
(Insolvenzverwalter) under the rules of avoidance as set out in the German Insolvency Code
(Insolvenzordnung).

Based on these rules, an insolvency administrator may challenge (anfechten) acts
(Rechtshandlungen) and transactions (Rechtsgesch¨afte) that are deemed detrimental to insolvency
creditors and were effected prior to the commencement of insolvency proceedings. Such
transactions can include the payment of any amounts to the holders of the notes as well as
granting them any security interest or a guarantee. The administrator’s right to challenge
transactions can, depending on the circumstances, extend to transactions during the ten-year
period prior to the filing of the petition for commencement of insolvency proceedings. In the event
such a transaction is successfully avoided, the holders of the notes would be under an obligation to
repay the amounts received to the insolvency estate or to waive the guarantee or security interest.

In particular, an act (Rechtshandlung) or a transaction (Rechtsgesch¨aft) (which terms also
include the provision of security or the repayment of debt) may be avoided in the following cases,
as recently amended by the act to improve legal certainty with respect to avoidance claims under
the German Insolvency Code and the German Code on Avoidance (Gesetz zur Verbesserung der

321


-----

_Rechtssicherheit bei Anfechtungen nach der Insolvenzordnung und dem Anfechtungsgesetz) which_
became effective on 5 April 2017:

   - any act granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor to obtain, security
(Sicherung) or satisfaction (Befriedigung) (i) if such act was performed during the last three
months prior to the filing of the petition for the commencement of the insolvency
proceedings and the debtor was illiquid (zahlungsunf¨ahig) at the time when such act was
taken and the creditor had knowledge of such illiquidity at such time, or (ii) if such act was
performed after the filing of the petition for the commencement of the insolvency
proceedings and the creditor had knowledge of the illiquidity of the debtor or the filing of
such petition (awareness of other circumstances leading inevitably to the conclusion of
illiquidity or the filing of an insolvency petition will be deemed equivalent to the actual
awareness of the illiquidity or of the filed petition);

   - any act granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor to obtain, security
(Sicherung) or satisfaction (Befriedigung) to which such creditor was not entitled or which
was granted or obtained in a form or at a time to which or at which such creditor was not
entitled to such security or satisfaction if (i) such act was performed during the last month
prior to the filing of the petition for the commencement of the insolvency proceedings or
after such filing, (ii) such act was performed during the second or third month prior to the
filing of the petition and the debtor was illiquid at such time, or (iii) such act was performed
during the second or third month prior to the filing of the petition for the commencement of
the insolvency proceedings and the creditor knew at the time such act was taken that such
act was detrimental to the other insolvency creditors (awareness of other circumstances
leading inevitably to the disadvantageous treatment of insolvency creditors will be deemed
equivalent to the actual awareness of such disadvantage);

   - any transaction by the debtor that is directly detrimental to the insolvency creditors or by
which the debtor loses a right or the ability to enforce a right or by which a proprietary
claim against the debtor is obtained or becomes enforceable, if (i) it was entered into during
the three months prior to the filing of the petition of the commencement of the insolvency
proceedings, the debtor was illiquid at the time of such transaction and the counterparty to
such transaction had knowledge of the illiquidity at such time or (ii) it was entered into after
such filing and the counterparty to such transaction had knowledge of either the debtor’s
illiquidity or such filing at the time of the transaction;

   - any act by the debtor without (adequate) consideration (e.g., whereby a debtor grants
security for a third-party debt, which might be regarded as having been granted gratuitously
(unentgeltlich)), if it was effected in the four years prior to the filing of the petition for the
commencement of insolvency proceedings;

   - any act performed by the debtor (i) during the ten years prior to the filing of the petition for
the commencement of insolvency proceedings or at any time after the filing with the intent
to prejudice the insolvency creditors and the other party knew of such intention at the time
of such act, with such knowledge being presumed if the beneficiary knew that the debtor’s
illiquidity was imminent and that the transaction disadvantaged the other creditors (except
for acts granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor, to obtain security
or satisfaction to which such creditor was entitled, in which case such knowledge (solely)
being presumed if such creditor knew that the debtor was illiquid and that the transaction
disadvantaged the other creditors), (ii) except for such acts granting an insolvency creditor,
or enabling an insolvency creditor, to obtain security (Sicherung) or satisfaction
(Befriedigung) (whether or not it was granted or obtained in a form or at a time to which or
at which such creditor was entitled to such security or satisfaction), which may only be

322


-----

avoided if they were effected in the four years prior to the filing of the petition for the
commencement of insolvency proceedings or at a time after the filing;

   - any non-gratuitous contract concluded between the debtor and a related party of the debtor
that directly causes detriment to creditors, unless such contract was concluded more than
two years prior to the filing for the opening of insolvency proceedings or the other party had
no knowledge of the debtor’s intention to disadvantage its creditors; and

   - any act that provides security (Sicherung) or satisfaction (Befriedigung) for a shareholder
loan (Gesellschafterdarlehen) made to the debtor or an economically similar claim if (i) in
the case of the provision of security, the act occurred during the ten years prior to the filing
of the petition for the commencement of the insolvency proceedings or after the filing of
such petition, or (ii) in the case of satisfaction, the act occurred during the last year prior to
the filing of the petition for the commencement of the insolvency proceedings or after the
filing of such petition. It being understood, that the regulation for shareholder loans does not
apply (i) to shareholders which own 10% or less of the shares or interest and are not
engaged in management and (ii) until the successful restructuring of the debtor in case a
creditor for the first time acquires shares during over-indebtedness, illiquidity or imminent
illiquidity for the purpose of restructuring the debtor.

   - any act whereby the debtor grants satisfaction for a loan claim or an economically similar
claim to a third party if (i) the transaction was effected in the last year prior to the filing of a
petition for opening of insolvency proceedings or thereafter, and (ii) a shareholder of the
debtor had granted security or was liable as a guarantor (Garant) or surety (B¨urge) (in which
case the shareholder has to compensate the debtor for the amounts paid (subject to further
conditions)).

In this context, ‘‘knowledge’’ generally is deemed to exist if the other party is aware of the
facts from which the conclusion must be drawn that the debtor was unable to pay its debts
generally as they fell due, that a petition for the commencement of insolvency proceedings had
been filed, or that the act was detrimental to, or intended to prejudice, the insolvency creditors, as
the case may be. With respect to a ‘‘related party’’, there is a general statutory presumption that
such party had ‘‘knowledge’’. The term ‘‘related party’’ includes, subject to certain limitations, in the
case of debtors that are corporate persons, members of the management or supervisory board,
shareholders owning more than 25% of the debtor’s share capital, persons or companies holding
comparable positions that give them access to information about the economic situation of the
debtor, and persons that are spouses, relatives or members of the household of any of the
foregoing persons.

If any of the guarantees granted by any of the German guarantors were avoided or held
unenforceable for any reason, you would cease to have any claim in respect thereof. Any amounts
received from a transaction that has been avoided would have to be repaid to the insolvent estate.

Furthermore, even in the absence of an insolvency proceeding, a third-party creditor who has
obtained an enforcement order (Vollstreckungstitel) but has failed to obtain satisfaction of its
enforceable claims by a levy of execution, under certain circumstances, has the right to avoid
certain transactions, such as the payment of debt and the granting of security pursuant to the
German Code on Avoidance (Anfechtungsgesetz).

In addition, under German law, a creditor who provided additional, or extended existing,
funding to a debtor or obtained security from a debtor may be liable in tort if such creditor was
aware of the debtor’s (impending) insolvency or of circumstances indicating such debtor’s
(impending) insolvency at the time such funding was provided or extended or such security was
granted. The German Federal Court of Justice (Bundesgerichtshof) held that this could be the case

323


-----

if, for example, the creditor was to act with the intention of detrimentally influencing the position of
the other creditors of the debtor in violation of the legal principle of bonos mores (Sittenwidrigkeit).
Such intention could be present if the beneficiary of the transaction was aware of any
circumstances indicating that the debtor as the grantor of the guarantee or security was close to
collapse (Zusammenbruch), or had reason to enquire further with respect thereto.

The German restructuring laws may be subject to further amendments in near future due to
the current EU Commission’s proposal as of November 22, 2016 for a directive of the European
Parliament and of the Council on preventive restructuring frameworks, second chance and
measures to increase the efficiency of restructuring, insolvency and discharge procedures and
amending Directive 2012/30/EU which may, inter alia, stipulate that the claims under the notes can
be modified by majority vote and against the voting of a creditor even outside formal insolvency
proceedings.

**_Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of Guarantees_**

The German guarantors are incorporated in the form of a German limited liability company
(Gesellschaft mit beschr¨ankter Haftung, GmbH) or have a partner which is a GmbH. Consequently,
the guarantees and the grant of collateral by them is subject to certain provisions of the German
Limited Liability Company Act (Gesetz betreffend die Gesellschaft mit beschr¨ankter Haftung,
‘‘GmbHG’’).

As a general rule, sections 30 and 31 of the GmbHG (‘‘Sections 30 and 31’’) prohibit a GmbH
from disbursing its assets to its shareholders to the extent that the amount of the GmbH’s net
assets (i.e., assets minus liabilities and liability reserves) is already less or would fall below the
amount of its stated share capital (Stammkapital). The granting of guarantees, share pledges and
other security by a GmbH in order to guarantee or secure liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or
sister company may be considered disbursements under Sections 30 and 31. Therefore, in order to
enable German subsidiaries to grant guarantees and to create security interests to secure liabilities
of a direct or indirect parent or sister company without the risk of violating Sections 30 and 31, it is
standard market practice for indentures, credit agreements, guarantees and security documents to
contain so-called ‘‘limitation language’’ in relation to subsidiaries in the legal form of a GmbH, a
trade partnership (offene Handelsgesellschaft) with a GmbH as a partner (GmbH & Co. oHG) or a
limited liability partnership (Kommanditgesellschaft) with a GmbH as its sole general partner
(Komplement¨ar) (GmbH & Co. KG) incorporated or established in Germany. Pursuant to such
limitation language, the beneficiaries of the guarantees and security interests agree, subject to
certain exemptions, to require payments under the guarantee or, as the case may be, enforce the
security interests against the German subsidiary only to the extent that such payment or, as the
case may be, enforcement does not result in the GmbH’s (or, in case of a GmbH & Co. KG
or GmbH & Co oHG, its Gmb partner’s) net assets falling below its stated share capital or, as the
case may be, if the net assets are already below the amount of its stated share capital, to cause
such amount to be further reduced. Accordingly, the Indenture, security documents and other
relevant documents relating to the guarantees and the collateral provided by the Issuer and the
German guarantors or other German security providers will contain such limitation language and
the relevant guarantees and collateral will be limited in the manner described. This could lead to a
situation in which the respective security granted by a GmbH, a GmbH & Co. oHG or GmbH & Co
KG cannot be enforced at all.

German capital maintenance rules are subject to ongoing court decisions. Future court rulings
may further limit the access of shareholders to assets of their subsidiaries constituted in the form of
a GmbH, a GmbH & Co. oHG or a GmbH & Co. KG, which can negatively affect the ability of the
subsidiaries to make payments on the guarantees, of the secured parties to enforce the collateral or
of the beneficiaries of the guarantees to enforce the guarantees.

324


-----

The beneficiary of a transaction effecting a repayment of the stated share capital of the grantor
of the guarantee or security could moreover become personally liable under exceptional
circumstances. The German Federal Court of Justice (Bundesgerichtshof) ruled that this could be
the case if for example the creditor were to act with the intention of detrimentally influencing the
position of the other creditors of the debtor in violation of the legal principle of contra bonos mores
(Sittenwidrigkeit). Such intention could be present if the beneficiary of the transaction was aware of
any circumstances indicating that the grantor of the guarantee or security is close to collapse
(Zusammenbruch), or had reason to enquire further with respect thereto. Under such
circumstances, the granted security interests and/or guarantees may also be invalid.

Furthermore, it cannot be ruled out that the case law of the German Federal Court of Justice
(Bundesgerichtshof) regarding so-called destructive interference (existenzvernichtender Eingriff)
(i.e., a situation where a shareholder deprives a German limited liability company of the liquidity
necessary for it to meet its own payment obligations) may be applied by courts with respect to the
enforcement of a guarantee or security granted by a German (direct or indirect) subsidiary of the
Issuer. In such a case, the amount of proceeds to be realized in an enforcement process may be
reduced, even to zero. Moreover, according to a decision of the German Federal Court of Justice
(Bundesgerichtshof), a security agreement may be void due to tortious inducement of breach of
contract if a creditor knows about the stressed financial situation of the debtor and anticipates that
the debtor will only be able to grant collateral by disregarding the vital interests of its other
business partners. It cannot be ruled out that German courts may apply this case law with respect
to the granting of the guarantees and/or the collateral by the German guarantors.

In addition, enforcement of the guarantees and security interests granted by subsidiaries of
the Issuer may be limited under its respective terms to the extent that it would lead to the illiquidity
(Zahlungsunf¨ahigkeit) of the Issuer granting such guarantee or security interest.

German civil procedure differs substantially from U.S. civil procedure in a number of respects.
In as far as the production of evidence is concerned, U.S. law and the laws of several other
jurisdictions based on common law provide for pre-trial discovery, a process by which parties to the
proceedings may prior to trial compel the production of documents by adverse or third parties and
the deposition of witnesses. Evidence obtained in this manner may be decisive in the outcome of
any proceeding. No equivalent pre-trial discovery process exists under German law.

If the party in whose favor a final judgment is rendered brings a new lawsuit in a competent
court in Germany, such party may submit to the German court the final judgment rendered in the
United States. Under such circumstances, a judgment by a federal or state court of the United
States against such party or such persons will be regarded by a German court only as evidence of
the outcome of the dispute to which such judgment relates. A German court may choose to re-hear
the dispute and may render a judgment not in line with the judgment rendered by a federal or state
court of the United States.

**Hong Kong**

**_Certain Insolvency Considerations_**

Insolvency proceedings with respect to a guarantor incorporated under the laws of Hong Kong
may be commenced in Hong Kong and, if so, will be based on Hong Kong insolvency law. Under
certain circumstances, insolvency proceedings may also be opened in Hong Kong in accordance
with Hong Kong law with respect to a company that is not incorporated under Hong Kong law (for
example, if such company is registered as a non-Hong Kong company with the Companies Registry
in Hong Kong or has (among other things) a sufficient connection with Hong Kong).

325


-----

Formal insolvency proceedings under the laws of Hong Kong may be initiated in a number of
ways, including by the company resolving to do so or by a creditor of the company filing a petition
to wind up the company.

Liquidation is a company dissolution procedure under which the assets of a company are
realized and distributed by the liquidator to creditors in the statutory order of priority prescribed by
the Companies (Winding Up and Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance (Cap. 32 of the laws of Hong
Kong). At the end of the liquidation process the company may be dissolved.

In the event of a liquidation under Hong Kong insolvency law, assets securing indebtedness
may only be used to satisfy the liabilities of the company in liquidation to its unsecured creditors
after payment of the indebtedness in respect of which the relevant security has been provided and
after payment of all claims entitled to priority under Hong Kong insolvency law. Currently, these
debts entitled to priority may include, among others, (a) certain amounts owed to the Government,
and (b) certain amounts owed to employees, in each case, which also have priority ahead of a
floating charge. Further, all expenses (including the liquidator’s remuneration) properly incurred in a
winding up are also payable out of the company’s assets in priority to all other claims.

Any interest accruing under or with respect to amounts due under the guarantee provided by
the company being liquidated under Hong Kong insolvency law with respect to any period after the
commencement of liquidation proceedings would only be recoverable by the holders of the notes
(pari with other creditors) from any surplus remaining after payment of all other debts proved in the
proceedings and accrued and unpaid interest up to the date of the commencement of the
proceedings.

Under Hong Kong insolvency law, any payment or other act relating to property made or done
by a company within six months or two years in the event of transactions entered into with an
‘‘associate’’ (as defined in the Bankruptcy Ordinance (Cap. 6 of the laws of Hong Kong)) before the
commencement of its winding up is invalid if the insolvent company in making that payment or
doing that act did so with a view to giving a creditor an unfair preference, which will be presumed if
the parties are ‘‘associates’’. Further, a transaction may be set aside by the court under Hong Kong
law if it amounts to a disposition of property with the ‘‘intent to defraud creditors’’. A liquidator,
creditor or other person thereby prejudiced may apply to the court for relief.

A floating charge on the undertaking or property of a company may be invalid if created in the
period of twelve months ending with the presentation of a winding up petition of the company,
unless it is proved that the company immediately after the creation of the charge was solvent,
except to the extent of any cash paid to the company at the time of or subsequently to the creation
of, and in consideration for, the charge (together with interest on such amount at the rate specified
in the charge or at the rate of 12% per annum, whichever is less).

**_Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of Guarantees_**

There is doubt as to the enforceability in Hong Kong in original actions or in actions for
enforcement of judgments of U.S. courts, of civil liabilities predicated solely upon federal securities
laws of the United States or the securities laws of any State or territory within the United States.

The United States and Hong Kong have not entered into any bilateral reciprocal enforcement
agreement providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and
commercial matters. A final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any federal or state
court of the United States would not be automatically enforceable in Hong Kong.

**Mexico**

**_Certain Insolvency Considerations_**

In the event of insolvency of a Mexican guarantor, the relevant insolvency proceedings may be
initiated in Mexico. Such proceedings will be governed by Mexican law. The insolvency laws of
Mexico may not be as favourable to your interests — or may even preclude your interests as
creditors — as the insolvency laws of other jurisdictions, including in respect of priority of creditors,
enforceability, the ability to obtain post-petition interest and the duration of the insolvency
proceedings, and hence may limit your ability to recover payments due on the notes to the extent
exceeding the limitations arising under other insolvency laws.

The Mexican Insolvency Law (Ley de Concursos Mercantiles) contemplates a single
proceeding for reorganisation (concurso mercantil) and bankruptcy (quiebra) with two successive
stages: the first stage, known as the ‘‘mediation’’ stage (etapa de conciliaci´on), is compulsory and
is designed to reorganise the insolvent entity; and the second stage, known as the ‘‘bankruptcy’’
stage (etapa de quiebra), provides for the bankruptcy and liquidation of the insolvent entity. In
limited cases (as described below), the creditors or the petitioner may decide to skip the first stage
and begin the proceeding directly as a bankruptcy.

The mediation stage commences on the date the insolvency judgment is rendered and
concludes on the date that is 185 calendar days after the last date of publication of such insolvency
judgment in the Federal Official Gazzette (Diario Oficial de la Federaci´on; the ‘‘DOF’’); provided, that
if a reorganization agreement with creditors is not executed before the expiration of such 185 day
period, (i) such mediation stage may be extended 90 calendar days at the request of the mediator
_or with the consent of those recognized creditors holding title to at least 50% of all aggregate_
recognized claims, and (ii) such term may be further extended for an additional 90 calendar days at
the request of the insolvent entity and those recognized creditors holding title to 75% of all
aggregate recognized claims, for a maximum term of 365 calendar days, whenever they consider
that the execution of the reorganization agreement is forthcoming. If a valid reorganization
agreement has not been reached upon the conclusion of such periods, the insolvent entity will be
automatically declared in bankruptcy, without the need for a ruling (the judge shall only have the
authority to certify the termination of the term, but may not issue a ruling concerning the termination
of the mediation stage). The corresponding insolvency court may terminate the mediation stage at
any time if either the insolvent entity or its creditors are unwilling or unable to reach an agreement.

In Mexico, a person will be declared insolvent when it generally fails to pay its obligations with
two or more creditors as and when they become due. Insolvency of a person will be adjudicated
upon the request of the insolvent entity, the Mexican attorney general’s office or any creditor of the
insolvent entity when, on the date of filing of the insolvency petition: (i) such delinquent obligations
that have been delinquent for more than 30 days represent 35% or more of all its outstanding
obligations; and/or (ii) the insolvent entity does not have sufficient liquid assets (namely, cash and
cash equivalents, such as bank deposits and account receivables with a maturity of no more than
90 calendar days, or securities that may be sold within 30 banking days, in each case, from the
date of filing of the insolvency request) to pay at least 80% of its due and payable obligations on
the date of filing of the insolvency request. If the insolvency request is filed voluntarily by the
insolvent entity, only one of the conditions described in items (i) and (ii) above would have to be
satisfied. If the attorney general’s office or any creditor of the insolvent entity files the insolvency
request, both conditions described in items (i) and (ii) above would have to be satisfied. An
insolvency presumption will exist with respect to any person or entity when, inter alia, (a) its assets
for attachment in aid of execution of a judgment or claim are insufficient to satisfy such judgement;
or (b) it has failed to pay two or more creditors; or (c) it has participated in fraudulent or fictitious
acts to avoid payment to creditors.

327


-----

In addition, the Insolvency Law allows for a company to file an insolvency petition by declaring
under oath that a state of insolvency under items (i) or (ii) above is imminent (i.e., that the company
will unavoidably meet any of the conditions described therein within the 90 calendar days following
such insolvency request), without complying with such conditions at the time the filing is made.

Upon filing of a petition for a judgment declaring insolvency, the court will instruct the Federal
Institute of Insolvency Specialists (Instituto Federal de Especialistas de Concursos Mercantiles) to
appoint an inspector (visitador) to visit the entity presumed to be insolvent and to inform the tax
authorities. The inspector will review accounting and financial records and will then issue an opinion
regarding the commercial entity’s insolvency, which will enable the court to issue a judicial
resolution declaring the legal insolvency of such person. Following the issuance of such insolvency
judgement, the Federal Institute of Insolvency Specialists will designate and appoint a mediator
(conciliador) who will facilitate the negotiations between the insolvent entity and its creditors in
order to reach a creditors’ reorganization agreement. The issuance of the insolvency judgment and
the appointment of the mediator will initiate the ‘‘mediation’’ stage of the insolvency proceeding.
The insolvency proceeding in Mexico is at all times court controlled, and upon receipt of an
insolvency petition, the insolvency court may take preliminary measures (providencias precautorias)
to safeguard the property of the insolvent entity.

As from the date a petition for insolvency is filed, the insolvent entity may request
authorisation from the judge to receive emergency loans for the management of the estate of the
insolvent entity or that is indispensable to maintain the operation of the company and to ensure
there is enough liquidity during the insolvency proceeding. The judge may authorise these loans
and may even authorise the granting of security interests in connection thereto. It should be noted
that these loans are senior to secured and unsecured loans assumed before the insolvency petition.

During the ‘‘mediation’’ stage, the insolvent entity and those creditors that have been
recognised within the insolvency proceeding as creditors of the insolvent entity would negotiate a
reorganization agreement with respect to the payment of the outstanding obligations of the
insolvent entity. In order for such creditors’ reorganization agreement to become effective and
binding, it must be entered into between the insolvent entity and those recognised creditors holding
title to more than 50% of the sum of (i) the amount of all unsecured claims of all unsecured
recognised creditors and subordinated creditors of the insolvent entity, plus (ii) the amount of all
secured claims of those secured recognised creditors that enter into such creditors’ reorganization
agreement.

In the event the insolvent entity has recognised qualified subordinated creditors (essentially
related parties of the insolvent entity) that represent at least 25% or more of the total amount of
recognized claims, then such subordinated claims will not be taken into account for the voting
requirements described above. The above shall not apply in the event the recognised subordinated
creditors agree to the reorganisation accepted by the rest of the recognised creditors, in which
case, the percentages provided in the foregoing paragraph apply.

The creditors’ reorganization agreement would then have to be approved by the insolvency
court. A secured claim under the Mexican Insolvency Law is considered to be a claim secured
under a pledge or a mortgage or otherwise benefiting from any other form of statutory privilege or
priority of payment. The concept of subordinated creditor was recently introduced to the Mexican
insolvency law. Subordinated creditor means (i) any creditor that agreed to subordinate their debt
below unsecured creditors; and (ii) certain related party that have unsecured credit against the
Mexican guarantor.

Notwithstanding the aforementioned voting requirements, the Mexican Insolvency Law
provides the possibility for partial cram-downs to be imposed as a result of a reorganization
agreement. For such purposes, a reorganization agreement will only become binding on those

328


-----

unsecured recognized creditors that did not enter into such agreement to the extent that any
cram-down, standstill, or any combination thereof imposed on such unsecured recognized creditors
is at least equal to a lesser cram-down, longer standstill, or combination thereof, applicable to those
unsecured recognized creditors that did enter into the reorganization agreement and that represent
at least 30% of total amount of unsecured recognized claims.

The reorganization agreement is final and binding once voted by the creditors pursuant to the
thresholds described above. The reorganization agreement may be subject to amendments only if
circumstances which materially affect the possibility of complying with such agreement occur and a
motion is filed before the judge that held jurisdiction over the original insolvency proceeding.

For purposes of determining the amount of all claims against the insolvent entity, (i) all
unsecured peso denominated indebtedness will be converted into Unidades de Inversi´on (‘‘UDIs’’),
and interest thereon will cease to accrue on such indebtedness; (ii) all unsecured indebtedness
denominated in foreign currency will be converted into Mexican pesos and subsequently into UDIs,
and interest thereon will cease to accrue on such indebtedness; and (iii) all secured indebtedness
will be maintained in the agreed currency, and ordinary (but not default) interest thereon will
continue to accrue on such indebtedness up to an amount equivalent to the value of the applicable
collateral.

Secured recognised creditors that do not become a party to the creditors’ reorganization
agreement may commence or continue foreclosure of their respective collateral; unless, the
creditors’ agreement contemplates the payment of their respective claims or the payment of the
price of the properties constituting such collateral. In this case, any credit excess with respect to
the value of such properties would be deemed an unsecured claim for purposes of the insolvency
proceeding.

In order to expedite an insolvency proceeding, the insolvent entity may file a proceeding with
a reorganization plan, pre-agreed upon with its creditors that represent at least a simple majority of
all outstanding indebtedness. Consequently, the mediation stage of the proceeding would be
limited to the definitive approval of the plan pursuant to the voting requirements described above.

The insolvency court would be required to issue a judgment declaring the bankruptcy of the
insolvent entity: (i) at the request of the insolvent entity (or its creditors but only to the extent that
the insolvent entity confesses judgement (se allane) in the petition of the insolvency judgement); or
(ii) at the expiration of the ‘‘mediation stage’’ without the filing of an approved creditors’
reorganization agreement before the insolvency court or (iii) under certain circumstances at the
request of the mediator.

Upon such declaration of bankruptcy, the insolvency court would instruct the Federal Institute
of Insolvency Specialists (Instituto Federal de Especialistas de Concursos Mercantiles) to designate
and appoint a receiver (s´ındico) that would be charged with the management of the insolvent entity
until its liquidation. The receiver would carry out the liquidation of the insolvent entity through the
sale of its assets, in accordance with certain pre-set rules and conditions. The proceeds obtained
from the liquidation of the assets of the insolvent entity would be applied by the receiver to make
payments to creditors in the following order of priority:

i. first, payment of labour claims for salaries and severance for the calendar year
immediately preceding the insolvency judgment;

ii. second, claims derived from financing incurred for the management of the estate of the
insolvent entity or financing that is indispensable to maintain the ordinary operations of
the company and the necessary liquidity during the insolvency proceeding, in each case,
as approved by the Mediator and by the court;

329


-----

iii. third, payment of liabilities and obligations of the estate of the insolvent entity
(i.e., management costs, fees and expenses incurred after the insolvency judgement is
issued);

iv. fourth, payment of costs and expenses derived from judicial and extrajudicial
proceedings for the benefit of the insolvency estate;

v. fifth, payment to secured creditors as described below (including costs and expenses
relating to foreclosure and the enforcement of their respective rights, litigation expenses
for the defense or recovery of the collateral and necessary expenses for the
refurbishment, conservation and disposal of such collateral), but only to the extent of the
value of their respective collateral;

vi. sixth, payment of labour claims (different than those described in numeral (i) above) and
tax claims;

vii. seventh, payments to other creditors that qualify as ‘‘privileged’’ under Mexican
commercial laws (e.g., creditors that are entitled to retain an asset until payment is
made), but only to the extent of the value of the respective privilege;

viii. eighth, payments to unsecured creditors; and

ix. ninth, payments to (a) subordinated creditors and (b) creditors that are related parties of
the insolvent company.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, claims of secured creditors would be paid on a ‘‘super-priority’’
basis up to the amount of the respective collateral, and only the following claims would have
priority over the amount of such collateral:

1. _first, labor claims for salaries and severance for the calendar year preceding the issuance_
of the insolvency judgment;

2. _second, litigation expenses related for the defense or recovery of secured assets; and_

3. _third, necessary expenses for the repair, maintenance and disposition of the secured_
assets

Generally, the issuance of an insolvency judgment may affect the enforceability of the
guarantees granted by the Mexican guarantors. On the date of an insolvency judgment issued
against any of the Mexican guarantors, the obligations of such Mexican guarantor under the
notes (i) would be subject to the outcome of, and priorities recognised in, the Mexican insolvency
law, (ii) would cease to accrue interest from the date a reorganisation proceeding is declared and
would be converted to UDIs (as described above), and (iii) would be subject to certain statutory
preferences including tax, social security and labour claims (as described above).

**_Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of Guarantees_**

In the event a Mexican guarantor becomes subject to an insolvency proceeding, the relevant
guarantee may be deemed to have been a fraudulent transfer and rendered null and void. As a
general rule, the insolvency judgment will become effective retroactively on the date that is
270 calendar days prior to the date of the applicable insolvency judgment (for the purposes of this
description, the ‘‘Effective Date’’). The Effective Date may be extended if (i) the mediator, the
receiver or any creditor describes a series of acts that may be deemed fraudulent and therefore
requests such extension, which may not exceed 3 years; or (ii) regarding acts involving related
parties, the insolvency judgment will become effective 540 days prior to such acts.

330


-----

Under the Mexican Insolvency Law, all actions of the insolvent entity to defraud its creditors
will be null and void. Any action consummated by a Mexican guarantor prior to the date of an
insolvency judgement will be deemed fraudulent when the Mexican guarantor is knowingly
defrauding its creditors, and the third party participating in any such action had actual knowledge of
such fraudulent intent. If the action is gratuitous, the action will be deemed fraudulent even if the
third party had no actual knowledge of the fraudulent intent.

Any action consummated by a Mexican guarantor at any time after the Effective Date, (i) will
be deemed fraudulent when, inter alia, (a) the Mexican guarantor receives no consideration, or the
consideration received or paid by the Mexican guarantor, or the terms and conditions of the
transaction, are clearly or materially below market, or (b) the Mexican guarantor makes a payment
of indebtedness not yet due, or forgives debt owed to it; and (ii) will be presumed fraudulent,
unless the interested third party proves that it was acting in good faith, when (a) the Mexican
guarantor grants or increases collateral that was not originally contemplated and (b) the Mexican
guarantor makes any payments in-kind not originally contemplated. In addition, certain transactions
among related parties will also be deemed fraudulent.

In addition, most civil codes of the different states in Mexico, contain fraudulent conveyance
provisions pursuant to which a court may set aside the obligations of Mexican guarantors under
any collateral documents even outside of an insolvency proceeding when the Mexican guarantor
unduly gave a priority to one creditor over its former creditors.

_Other Mexican Law Considerations_

In the event that proceedings are brought against a Mexican guarantor in Mexico, either to
enforce a judgment or as a result of an original action brought before Mexican courts, or if payment
is otherwise claimed from a Mexican guarantor in Mexico, the Mexican guarantor would not be
required to discharge those obligations in a currency other than Mexican currency. Under the
Monetary Law of the United Mexican States (Ley Monetaria de los Estados Unidos Mexicanos) an
obligation, whether resulting from a judgment or by agreement, denominated in a currency other
than Mexican currency, which is payable in Mexico, may be satisfied in Mexican currency at the rate
of exchange in effect on the date on which payments are made. Such rate is currently determined
by the Mexican Central Bank (Banco de M´exico) and published every banking day in Mexico’s
Federal Official Gazette. As a result, you may suffer a Euro shortfall if you obtain a judgment, a
distribution in bankruptcy in Mexico or any other payment from a Mexican guarantor with respect to
the notes or the guarantees granted by a Mexican guarantor in Mexico, in Mexican pesos. You
should be aware that no separate action exists or is enforceable in Mexico for compensation for
any Euro shortfall.

Self-help remedies are not enforceable in Mexico; the taking of possession, entry, removal,
sale, transfer or other disposition of property or similar actions in Mexico pursuant to remedial
provisions may not be made in Mexico without judicial intervention, under due legal process
consistent with Mexican law provisions, including, without limitation, that the defendant is given the
right to be heard and defeated in court.

Under Mexican law, the extension or the granting of grace periods to the Issuer under the
notes, any modification of a guaranteed obligation that would increase any obligation of the
Mexican guarantors under the guarantees granted, or the novation (novaci´on) of the principal
obligation of the Issuer under the notes, would require the consent of the Mexican guarantors.
Therefore, it should be noted that the obligations of the Mexican guarantors under the guarantees
granted, might not be enforced by Mexican courts if the guaranteed obligations are extended,
increased or novated (novadas) without the consent of the Mexican guarantors at that time.

331


-----

Provisions in the guarantees to the effect that the obligations of the Mexican guarantors are
those of a principal obligor and not merely a surety, and that its obligations will not be discharged
nor its liabilities be affected by the illegality, invalidity or unenforceability of any provisions of the
notes, may be unenforceable under Mexican law. Therefore, it should be noted that upon the lack
of genuineness, validity or enforceability of any principal obligations of the Issuer under the notes,
the guarantees granted by the Mexican guarantors shall be equally affected and may be
unenforceable in a proceeding before Mexican courts.

Judicial proceedings in Mexico tend to be formalistic and the enforcement of any guarantee in
Mexico could be hindered or delayed by formalities such as proper service of process or the
granting of an appropriate power of attorney to the attorney-in-fact acting on behalf of the plaintiff.
Further, the court may request an official Spanish translation of any documentary evidence not
executed in Spanish language.

The Mexican Supreme Court of Justice has recently determined that the usury prohibition
provided under Article 21 third paragraph, of the American Convention on Human Rights allows
Mexican judges to order, subject to their exclusive discretion and criteria, the reduction of any
interest rate considered as excessive or abusive, even if such reduction is not expressly requested
by the involved parties. The resolution adopted by the Mexican Supreme Court of Justice sets forth
certain elements that judges must analyze in each case (such as interest rates collected by credit
institutions under similar operations, among others). If on the date the resolution is adopted, and
attending to the particular circumstances of the case as well as accounting for all the evidence
validly presented before such court, the competent Judge is convinced that the interest rate agreed
by the parties is notoriously usurious, then the Judge shall proceed to suspend such usurious
condition and will reduce the interest rate by means of a reasoned and motivated judgement.

**Poland**

**_Certain Insolvency Considerations_**

Certain guarantors are incorporated in Poland (each, the ‘‘Polish guarantor’’) in the form of a
limited liability company (sp´ołka z ograniczon˛a¸ odpowiedzialno´sci˛a). Consequently, their
obligations under the guarantee are subject to limitations resulting from the application of laws on
bankruptcy and insolvency and laws on restructuring proceedings, as set out in, respectively, the
Polish Bankruptcy Act (Prawo Upadło´sciowe) of February 28, 2003 (Journal of Laws of 2015,
item 233, as amended) (the ‘‘Polish Bankruptcy Law’’) and Polish Restructuring Act (Prawo
_Restrukturyzacyjne) of May 15, 2015 (Journal of Laws of 2015, item 978, as amended) (the ‘‘Polish_
Restructuring Law’’).

_Insolvency and threat of insolvency_

If a guarantor’s centre of main business activity is in Poland, then pursuant to the Polish
Bankruptcy Law and the Council Regulation (EC) No 1346/2000 on insolvency proceedings,
bankruptcy proceedings of the guarantor should be conducted before a Polish court. Consequently,
in the event of the insolvency of such guarantor, bankruptcy proceedings would be governed by
Polish law. Similarly, in the event of such guarantor’s insolvency or its threat, restructuring
proceedings would also be subject to Polish law.

According to the Polish Bankruptcy Law, the Polish guarantor as a debtor will be declared
bankrupt if it has become insolvent, namely: (i) if it has lost its ability to fulfill its due pecuniary
liabilities when they fall due (wymagalne zobowi˛azania pieni˛e˙zne) (presumed to arise, if the delay in
fulfilling pecuniary obligations exceeds three months), or (ii) its pecuniary liabilities (except for future
liabilities and those to shareholders relating to loans and legal acts of similar effect, granted within
five years before the declaration of bankruptcy) exceed the total value of its assets (except for

332


-----

assets not constituting the bankruptcy estate) and such situation persists for longer than
24 months. It is presumed that the pecuniary liabilities of the debtor exceed its assets if, according
to the balance sheet, its liabilities (except for reserves for liabilities and liabilities to affiliates) exceed
the value of its assets and such situation persists beyond 24 months.

However, Polish Bankruptcy Law allows the court dismissing an application for bankruptcy if
there is no threat of losing ability by the Polish guarantor to fulfill its due pecuniary liabilities in near
future. Each individual who has the right to represent the Polish guarantor (whether alone or with
others) is obliged to file a motion to declare the Polish guarantor bankrupt within 30 days from
when the grounds for declaration of bankruptcy above are met. In practice, it is difficult to
determine the day from which 30 days’ time limit for filing the motion should be counted.
Additionally, the Polish guarantor’s personal creditors may file for bankruptcy of the Polish
guarantor.

According to the Polish Restructuring Law, the Polish guarantor as debtor will be endangered
with insolvency, if its commercial position shows that it may become insolvent within a short period
of time.

If the Polish guarantor is insolvent or endangered by insolvency, it may file a restructuring
motion. If a motion for declaration of bankruptcy and motion for restructuring have both been filed,
the court should first decide on the restructuring motion and hold the proceedings on the motion
for bankruptcy (unless putting them on hold would be against the interests of all creditors). The
debtor cannot be declared bankrupt during restructuring proceedings.

_Bankruptcy proceedings_

The principal aim of bankruptcy proceedings is the satisfaction of the creditors from the
proceeds obtained after sale of the debtor’s assets (bankruptcy proceedings would result in
dissolution of the debtor’s company unless otherwise permitted by law). In the event of bankruptcy
proceedings, the court appoints a bankruptcy receiver (syndyk) who takes over the management of
the bankrupt’s assets. From this moment on, the management of a debtor — bankrupt entity is
replaced by the receiver who administers the bankrupt entity’s assets and represents the bankrupt
entity. The bankrupt entity’s assets become bankruptcy assets which will be liquidated to pay off
creditors. The composition of bankruptcy assets is determined during preparation of the inventory
list and creditors’ receivables list which are prepared by the receiver. A motion for approval of the
terms of sale of the debtor’s enterprise or its organized part, or substantial part of its assets, may
be appended to the petition to commence bankruptcy proceedings (pre-packaged liquidation).

Upon the bankruptcy declaration all of the debtor’s debts become due and payable and
non-pecuniary debts are converted to pecuniary. Interest may be paid from the bankruptcy estate
only for the period up to the date of the declaration of bankruptcy, unless they are secured by
mortgages, pledges, registered pledges, treasury pledges and/or maritime pledges, and satisfied
from the security assets’ proceeds.

In bankruptcy proceedings, the claims of creditors under a guarantee will be satisfied from the
proceeds obtained from the sale of the Polish guarantor’s assets, unless an arrangement with
creditors is concluded.

The bankrupt’s claim may be set off against a creditor’s claim if both claims existed on the
date of declaration of bankruptcy, regardless of whether the claims have not yet become due and
payable. A set-off is not admissible if the bankrupt’s debtor acquired the claim by assignment or
endorsement after bankruptcy was declared or acquired it during the year preceding the date of
declaration of bankruptcy, while being aware that there were grounds for declaring bankruptcy.
However, this limitation does not apply (i) if the acquirer has become the bankrupt’s creditor as a

333


-----

result of repaying the bankrupt’s debt, for which it was liable personally or with certain property
items, and if the acquirer was not aware of the existence of grounds for declaring bankruptcy at the
time of assuming liability for the bankrupt’s debt or (ii) if the liability was assumed at least one year
before the date on which bankruptcy was declared. The set off is also not admissible if bankrupt’s
creditor become bankrupt’s debtor after the date of declaration of bankruptcy. The sum proposed
to be set off on the part of the debtor is the total of the debtor’s claim and on the part of the
creditor it is the creditor’s principal claim only, along with interests accrued until the date of
declaring bankruptcy. If the bankrupt’s debt without interest had not become due and payable by
the date of declaration of bankruptcy, the sum to be set-off is the amount due reduced by statutory
interest (which may not exceed six percent) between the date of declaration of bankruptcy until the
date of payment, and may not exceed two years. A creditor wishing to exercise the set-off right
must make a statement in this respect not later than when submitting the claim.

Once bankruptcy is declared, the bankrupt entity’s assets may not be subject of security,
charged with a pledge, registry pledge or treasury pledge, and no entries in land and mortgage
register or other registers may be made to establish any security interests, except for the entry of
mortgage if the application of such entry had been filed at least six months prior to filling the
motion for bankruptcy.

Contractual provisions which explicitly stipulate the contract amendment or termination in case
bankruptcy (or filling for it) by a contract party is declared are invalid. Also, provisions of an
agreement to which the bankrupt company is a party that hinder or prevent the aims of the
bankruptcy proceedings from being achieved will be deemed ineffective in relation to the
bankruptcy estate. These specific provisions of Polish law are deemed to be forcing their
jurisdiction with respect to provisions of the kind as referred to above also over contracts that are
subject to laws other than the laws of Poland, as long as said provisions of such contract would
apply to an entity that is subject to bankruptcy proceedings under Polish Bankruptcy Law.

If court proceedings against the bankrupt entity are pending on the day of the bankruptcy
declaration in any common courts, then such proceedings are in some cases discontinued. In
particular, in the bankruptcy proceedings, unless separate statutory laws provide otherwise,
proceedings initiated against the bankrupt before the date of declaration of bankruptcy concerning
a claim which filled within the bankruptcy proceedings may be continued only if they have not been
included in the list of claims (see below) once the procedures set out in law for the establishment
of the list have been exhausted. If proceedings were pending in which the bankrupt entity was the
plaintiff, the receiver replaces the bankrupt entity. If enforcement proceedings regarding the
receivables which may be filed within the bankruptcy proceedings were pending against the
bankrupt entity on the day of bankruptcy declaration, they are suspended with effect from the date
of the bankruptcy declaration and proceeds received are transferred to the bankruptcy estate after
the decision on the declaration of bankruptcy becomes final. If the arbitration proceedings were not
commenced on the date of declaration of bankruptcy, the receiver may with the consent of the
judge — commissioner renounce the arbitration clauses if the arbitration proceedings hinder the
liquidation of the bankruptcy estate. If the receiver renounces the arbitration clause it expires.

Creditors have a right to submit their claims within the time limit indicated in a decision
declaring bankruptcy. Claims supported by evidence of claims are usually admitted, i.e., included in
the list of claims. If a claim is not included in the list, then a creditor has a right to appeal. The
procedural requirements for submitting a claim are very formalistic. Under Polish Bankruptcy Law,
any debt payable in a currency other than Polish złoty (such as euro), if being put on the list of
claims, must be converted into Polish zloty according to the National Bank of Poland’s average
exchange rate prevailing on the date the bankruptcy court issues a decision on the debtor’s
bankruptcy (and regardless of whether the debt has fallen due or not). Accordingly, in the event of

334


-----

a bankruptcy of the company, the Bondholders may be subject to exchange rate risk between the
date of bankruptcy and the date of receipt of any amounts following a bankruptcy proceeding.

In the bankruptcy proceedings, creditors under the guarantee will be satisfied from the
proceeds obtained from the sale of the Polish guarantor’ assets.

As a rule, the Polish guarantor’s debts are divided into four categories and creditors whose
receivables are ranked in a lower category cannot be satisfied before all the debts in the higher
category have been fully satisfied. The first category principally includes payments to the state or
employees (remuneration, health benefit payments and social security obligations, etc.) or related to
the restructuring proceedings (including arising under a credit facility, loan, bonds, guarantees or
letters of credit, or other form of financing envisaged in the arrangement concluded in the
restructuring proceedings and provided in connection with the arrangement’s performance). Most
unsecured commercial debts, tax and other public dues are listed in the second category. The third
category encompasses interest on debts in the first and second categories (in the order in which
the principal is satisfied), court or administrative penalties, donations etc. The fourth category
concerns debts to direct and certain indirect shareholders relating to loans and legal acts of similar
effect that were granted within five years prior to the declaration of bankruptcy. Within a category,
each creditor’s receivable is satisfied pro rata to the total value of receivables listed in that category.
Before satisfying any claims, the official receiver covers the costs of bankruptcy proceedings and
the liabilities of the bankruptcy estate.

If an asset owned by the bankrupt entity (Polish guarantor) is secured with a mortgage,
pledge, registry pledge, treasury pledge or a maritime pledge, then a creditor has a right to receive
proceeds from that asset before other creditors (with few exceptions such as, for instance, a certain
portion of employee salaries). Where a number of mortgages or pledges have been established on
a real estate or the object of the pledge which considerably exceed its value, creditors are repaid
from according to their priority. The foreclosure of the object of encumbered with registered pledge
or financial pledge is generally permitted if the relevant agreement provides for such method of
satisfaction of creditor’s claim. However, the foreclosure is not allowed if such object is the part of
bankrupt’s enterprise and the sale of such object with the rest of the enterprise is more beneficial
than its separate sale.

In the course of the bankruptcy proceedings, an arrangement between the debtor and
creditors can be voted on and approved by the creditors. In such case after the approval by the
court, the provisions of the arrangement determine the manner of satisfaction of creditors’
receivables. If the repayment of receivables arising under the guarantee are covered by the
arrangement, there is a possibility that such receivables may be decreased on the basis of a
decision of the creditors (such decisions would be subject to certain mandatory rules of the Polish
Bankruptcy Law).

A holder of the notes who fails to satisfy his claim during bankruptcy proceedings may try to
raise this claim directly against persons acting on behalf of the Polish guarantor being a limited
liability company. Pursuant to the Polish Commercial Companies Code (Kodeks Sp´ołek
_Handlowych) of September 15, 2000 (Journal of Laws no. 94, item 1037, as amended) (the ‘‘Polish_
Commercial Companies Code’’) if enforcement against a company proves to be ineffective,
members of the management board of a limited liability company shall be jointly and severally
liable for the company’s liabilities. A member of the management board may be discharged from
liability referred to above if he proves that the bankruptcy petition was filed in a timely manner or in
the appropriate time the decision on the opening of the restructuring proceedings or the approval
of the arrangement in the approval arrangement proceedings were issued, or that a failure to file a
bankruptcy petition occurred through no fault on his part or that despite the failure to file a
bankruptcy petition or to issue the decision on the opening of the restructuring proceedings or the

335


-----

decision on the approval the arrangement in the approval arrangement proceedings, the creditor
suffered no additional damage.

_Restructuring proceedings_

Furthermore, the Polish guarantor may become subject to restructuring proceedings under
Polish law. Restructuring proceedings essentially aim to avoid the debtor’s bankruptcy through
restructuring by arrangement with creditors and, in the event of remedial proceedings
(post˛epowanie sanacyjne), also through remedial steps, while securing the justified rights of
creditors.

Restructuring proceedings may be initiated by a debtor’s motion, or, in case of remedial
proceedings (post˛epowanie sanacyjne) also on creditor’s motion, if the debtor is insolvent or
endangered by insolvency. The court will refuse restructuring proceedings, if they are detrimental to
creditors, or, in case of arrangement proceedings (post˛epowanie układowe) and remedial
proceedings (postepowanie sanacyjne) if the debtor’s ability to fund the costs of such proceedings
and obligations arising after the date of opening of the proceedings cannot be substantiated.

The debtor may request the commencement of one of the following restructuring proceedings:
(i) approval arrangement proceedings, (ii) accelerated arrangement proceedings; (iii) arrangement
proceedings and (iv) remedial proceedings (post˛epowanie sanacyjne).

In the case of approval arrangement proceedings, the debtor solicits votes from creditors on a
proposed arrangement without participation of the court. Once creditors have cast a sufficient
number of votes, the debtor may apply to the court for approval of the arrangement. They are
available when the sum of the disputed claims does not exceed 15% of the total claims.

Accelerated arrangement proceedings are designed to allow a debtor to conclude an
arrangement with the creditors following the preparation of a list of creditors’ receivables and its
approval by a judge — commissioner in simplified proceedings. The procedure may be applied
provided that the sum of disputed claims does not exceed 15% of the total claims. At the opening
of accelerated arrangement proceedings, the debtor’s assets constitute the arrangement estate. The
arrangement estate is administered by the debtor, unless the court decides that an administrator
should be appointed (e.g. if the debtor fails to perform the instructions of the judge —
commissioner or the court supervisor). From the opening of accelerated arrangement proceedings,
the debtor or administrator (if appointed) cannot satisfy any creditors’ receivable which is covered
by the arrangement, by operation of law. The enforcement proceedings concerning the claims to be
covered by the arrangement are stayed by the operation of law.

In arrangement proceedings, an arrangement may be concluded following the preparation of
the list of creditors’ receivables and its approval by a judge-commissioner in ordinary proceedings.
This procedure may be used when the sum of the disputed claims exceeds 15% of the total claims.
As in accelerated arrangement proceedings, the assets of the debtor form the arrangement estate,
which is administered by the debtor or administrator (if appointed). The debtor, or administrator (if
appointed) also may not satisfy any debt which is covered by the arrangement, by operation of law.
The enforcement proceedings concerning the claims to be covered by the arrangement are also
stayed by the operation of law.

Remedial proceedings allow a debtor to conclude an arrangement with creditors and
undertake various remedial actions which aim to improve the economic situation of the debtor and
restore the debtor’s capacity to perform his obligations. At the opening of remedial proceedings,
the debtor is deprived of its right to administer its assets (from the opening of proceedings they
constitute the remedial estate) and the assets are administered by a court-appointed administrator
(unless the court allows the debtor to retain the right to administer the remedial estate). The

336


-----

administrator can undertake a number of restructuring steps, including renouncing a not performed
mutual agreement, or challenging the effectiveness of certain acts undertaken by the debtor before
filing the motion to open remedial proceedings. Upon opening of the remedial proceedings, the
debtor or administrator are legally prohibited from making payments to satisfy claims which are
covered by the arrangement. The enforcement proceedings are also stayed by the operation of law.

The claim of the company which is subject to restructuring may be set off against a creditor’s
claim if both claims existed on the date of opening of restructuring proceedings (other than the
approval arrangement proceedings). However, the set-off is not admissible if (i) the debtor of the
company subject to restructuring acquired the claim against the company subject to restructuring
by assignment or endorsement after opening of the restructuring proceedings and (ii) such claim
came into existence prior to the opening of the restructuring proceedings. This limitation does not
apply (i) if the acquirer has become the creditor of company subject to restructuring as a result of
repaying such company’s debt, for which it was liable personally or with certain property items, and
(ii) if the liability was assumed at least one year before the date of opening of the restructuring
proceedings. Similarly, the set off is not permissible if the creditor of the company subject to
restructuring become a debtor of such company after the opening of the restructuring proceedings.
A creditor wishing to exercise the set-off right must make a statement within 30 days from opening
of the restructuring proceedings and if the grounds for set off arose after that date, then within
30 days from arising of the ground for set off.

Once the accelerated arrangement proceedings, arrangement proceedings or remedial
proceedings are opened, the entity’s assets may not be subject of security, charged with a pledge,
registry pledge or treasury pledge, and no entries in land and mortgage register or other registers
may be made to establish any security interests, except for the entry of mortgage if the application
of such entry had been filed at least six months prior to filling the motion for opening of the
proceedings.

Additionally, contractual provisions which explicitly stipulate the contract amendment or
termination in case opening restructuring proceedings (or filling for it) (except for approval
arrangement proceedings) by a contract party is declared are invalid. Also, provisions of an
agreement to which the debtor is a party that hinder or prevent the aims of the restructuring
proceedings from being achieved will be deemed ineffective in relation to the arrangement or
remedial estate (as applicable). These specific provisions of Polish law are deemed to be forcing
their jurisdiction with respect to provisions of the kind as referred to above also over contracts that
are subject to laws other than the laws of Poland, as long as said provisions of such contract would
apply to an entity that is subject to restructuring proceedings (other than approval arrangement
proceedings) under Polish Restructuring Law.

If the arrangement proceedings or accelerated arrangement proceedings are opened with
respect to the Polish guarantor, then certain actions in court proceedings against the Polish
guarantor will require court supervisor’s consent. If enforcement proceedings regarding the
receivables which are subject to arrangement were pending against the Polish guarantor on the day
of opening of such restructuring proceedings, they are suspended with effect from the opening of
such proceedings and proceeds received are transferred to the arrangement estate after the
issuance of decision on opening of the restructuring proceedings. The creditor secured with a
mortgage, pledge, registered pledge, treasury pledge and/or maritime pledge can conduct the
enforcement only with respect to the object of such in rem right. The court may also stay
enforcement of the claim which is not subject to the arrangement for the period of up to three
months if such enforcement concerns the object which is necessary to run Polish guarantor’s
enterprise.

337


-----

In case of opening of the remedial proceedings against the Polish guarantor, if proceedings
were pending in which the entity was the plaintiff, the administrator replaces the entity. If
enforcement proceedings regarding the receivables were pending against the Polish guarantor on
the day of opening of the remedial proceeding, they are suspended and proceeds received are
transferred to the remedial estate after the issuance of decision on the opening of the remedial
proceedings.

If creditors vote in favor of an arrangement, the arrangement is accepted and then approved
by the court. The court’s decision approving the arrangement may be appealed against. An
approved arrangement is binding on (affects) all creditors, whose receivables are covered by the
arrangement. Certain receivables are not covered (affected) by the arrangement. These include,
among other things: (i) receivables secured with mortgages, pledges, registered pledges, treasury
pledges and/or maritime pledges, however only up to the value of the collateral (to the extent they
can be satisfied from the security assets on which such security was established); a creditor whose
claims are so secured may, however, consent to being subject to arrangement, (ii) receivables
under derivative or repo transactions, and (iii) receivables under employment contracts. The
arrangement may also concern only certain types of receivables (partial arrangement). In such
case, the arrangement is binding on (affects) all creditors who have receivables of such type. In a
partial arrangement, there are several exceptions to the general rule that receivables secured by
mortgages, pledges, registered pledges, treasury pledges and/or maritime pledges are not covered
by the arrangement, without the consent of the creditor, up to the value of the collateral. The
consent of the creditor is not required, if the arrangement’s initial proposals envisage full
satisfaction of the creditor within the timeframe specified in the arrangement, or if they envisage
satisfaction to an extent not less than may be expected from the collateral.

If the repayment of receivables arising under the guarantee are covered by the arrangement,
there is a possibility that such receivables may be decreased on the basis of a decision of the
creditors (such decisions would be subject to certain mandatory rules of the Polish Restructuring
Law).

**_Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of Guarantees_**

_Limitations on Enforcement Resulting from Insolvency Laws and General Corporate Laws_

Certain Polish guarantors are incorporated in Poland in the form of a limited liability company
(sp´ołka z ograniczon˛a¸ odpowiedzialno´sci˛a). Consequently, their obligations under the guarantee
are subject to limitations resulting from the application of the laws on bankruptcy and insolvency
and the laws on restructuring proceedings, as set out in, respectively, the Polish Bankruptcy Act
(Prawo Upadło´sciowe) of February 28, 2003 (Journal of Laws of 2015, item 233, as amended) (the
‘‘Polish Bankruptcy Law’’) and Polish Restructuring Act (Prawo Restrukturyzacyjne) of May 15, 2015
(Journal of Laws of 2015, item 978, as amended) (the ‘‘Polish Restructuring Law’’).

Pursuant to Article 11 sec. 2 of the Polish Bankruptcy Law, a corporate entity is deemed to be
insolvent if its liabilities (zobowi˛azania) (excluding future liabilities, in particular the liabilities under
condition precedent, and liabilities toward the shareholders under loan or legal acts of similar effect,
granted within five years before the declaration of bankruptcy) exceed the value of its assets
(property) (maj˛atek) (except for assets which do not form part of the estate subject to bankruptcy)
and such circumstance lasts for the period exceeding 24 months. Given certain legal controversies
regarding the application of this rule, and in order to mitigate the possibility that the Polish
guarantor could be declared bankrupt under this rule, the liability of any Polish guarantor on
account of payments under the guarantee shall be limited to the amount equivalent to the Polish
guarantor’s assets (except for assets which do not form part of the estate subject to bankruptcy), to
the extent the obligations and liabilities of the Polish guarantor under the guarantee are not deemed

338


-----

to be future or conditional in the meaning of Article 11 sec. 2 and 4 of the Polish Bankruptcy Law.
This limitation of liability will no longer apply when the Polish guarantor becomes insolvent in the
meaning of Article 11 of the Polish Bankruptcy Law or upon acceleration of the notes or the Senior
Secured Credit Facilities (in spite of the previous application of that limitation of liability).

The guarantee by the Polish guarantor is also subject to certain provisions of the Polish
Commercial Companies Code (Kodeks Sp´ołek Handlowych) of September 15, 2000 (Journal of
Laws no. 94, item 1037, as amended) (the ‘‘Polish Commercial Companies Code’’).

In accordance with Article 189 sec. 2 of the Polish Commercial Companies Code,
shareholders may not receive, on whatever account, payments out of a company’s assets which
are necessary for the initial capital to be fully paid up. A more general Article 189 sec. 1 of the
Polish Commercial Companies Code prohibits the return of contributions to share capital to such
shareholders. In the Polish legal doctrine opinions are expressed that in certain situations, for
example when the financial standing of a company entering into a transaction is poor and a
shareholder of such company benefits from a transaction, it may in fact constitute the return of
share capital contribution to the shareholder. A breach of these rules results in the shareholders’
obligation to return the payments up to the amount of the share capital. Therefore, there is a risk
that the payment under the notes guarantee of any guarantor incorporated under Polish law will be
affected, or could be set aside, to the extent it would result in a reduction of its assets necessary to
cover in full its share capital in breach of Article 189 sec. 2 of the Polish Commercial Companies
Code or a return of contribution to share capital prohibited by Art. 189 par. 1 of the Polish
Commercial Companies Code.

_Effectiveness of the Guarantee in Case of Polish Guarantor’s Bankruptcy or Restructuring_

Under Polish Bankruptcy Law, the guarantee may be declared ineffective or deemed to be
ineffective in certain situations. In particular, the enforceability of the receivables arising under the
guarantee and the enforceability of the Security Interest in the insolvency proceedings depends on
whether they were granted at least six months before the filing of the motion for bankruptcy of the
Polish guarantor and, furthermore, whether the secured receivables are due and payable. Pursuant
to Polish Bankruptcy Law, if: (i) the debt secured by the guarantee is not due (dług niewymagalny);
and (ii) the guarantee was granted within six months before the filing of the motion for bankruptcy,
then they will be deemed ineffective. However, in such case, the creditor may bring an action or
charge in order to seek the recognition of the guarantee as effective if at the time when the same
were granted the creditor was unaware of the existence of grounds for declaration of bankruptcy of
the grantor.

Furthermore, if the guarantee is granted within six months preceding the date of the filing of
the motion for bankruptcy, it will be assessed whether the guarantee in this state of facts was
granted by the bankrupt entity to its partners or shareholders, their representatives or spouses of
the same, or affiliates, their partners or shareholders, representatives, or spouses of the same as
well as with another company, in the event of either being the controlling company. If so, the
guarantee will be declared ineffective towards the bankruptcy estate, unless the other party is able
to prove that they are not detrimental to other creditors.

The disposals made by the bankrupt in respect of its estate (czynno´sci prawne, kt´orymi upadły
_rozporz˛adził swoim maj˛atkiem) within one year before the filing of the motion for bankruptcy will be_
deemed ineffective towards the bankruptcy estate if the value of the disposal significantly (ra˙z˛aco)
exceeded consideration for the bankrupt, or there was no consideration for the bankrupt. It is not
entirely clear under the Polish Bankruptcy Law whether the guarantees are subject to such
clawback provisions since it is debatable whether they can be qualified as disposals. In addition,
mortgages or pledges established in the year preceding the filing of the motion to declare

339


-----

bankruptcy may be challenged if the bankrupt entity was not a personal debtor of the creditor
(such as a guarantor) and did not obtain any benefit in connection with such security interest. This
rule shall apply respectively in situations where an encumbrance was established in exchange for a
manifestly low (niewsp´ołmiernie niskie) consideration. In addition, any assignment of the future
claims is effective in bankruptcy proceedings if the assignment agreement was entered into at least
six months prior to submission of the motion for declaration of bankruptcy in the form with
signatures certified by the notary public.

Under the Polish Restructuring Law, the guarantee may also be declared ineffective or deemed
ineffective in certain situations.

The disposals made by the debtor in respect of its estate (czynno´sci prawne, kt´orymi dłu˙znik
_rozporz˛adził swoim maj˛atkiem) within one year before the filing of the motion for remedial_
proceedings will be deemed ineffective towards the remedial estate if the value of the disposal
materially (istotnie) exceeded consideration for the debtor or third party, or there was no
consideration for the debtor. It is not entirely clear under the Polish Restructuring Law whether the
guarantees are subject to such clawback provisions since it is debatable whether they can be
qualified as disposals.

Additionally, pursuant to the Polish Restructuring Law, if: (i) the guarantee was granted within
one year before the filing of the motion for opening restructuring proceedings; and (ii) the
guarantee was not granted directly in connection with consideration received by the guarantor, then
the guarantee will be ineffective towards the remedial estate. The guarantee will be ineffective
towards the remedial estate in the part in which it exceeds (as at the date of granting the
guarantee) the value of the secured claim together with ancillary claims specified in the document
establishing the guarantee by more than a half, and provided that the guarantee was granted within
a year before the filing of the motion for opening restructuring proceedings.

_Voidable transactions_

Under the Polish Civil Law Code (Kodeks Cywilny) of April 23, 1964 (Journal of Laws no. 16,
item 93, as amended), granting a guarantee may be declared ineffective if it constituted a
transaction effected by a debtor to the detriment of its creditors (i.e., where the debtor became
insolvent or became insolvent to a greater extent as a result of the transaction) while a third party
has gained a benefit, and provided that (i) the debtor consciously acted to the creditors’ detriment
and (ii) the third party knew or, had it acted with due diligence, could have known that the debtor
was acting to the detriment of its other creditors or gave no consideration for the benefit obtained
in such transaction.

In addition, if the Polish guarantor’s entering into a given agreement made it wholly or partially
impossible to satisfy a third party’s claim, such third party may request that the court declare such
an agreement ineffective towards that party, provided the Polish guarantor and the other party to
the agreement knew of the third party’s claim or if the agreement was for no consideration.

The creditor with respect to whom the company’s legal transaction was declared ineffective
may, with priority over the creditors of the third party, enforce the rights over assets which as a
result of such legal transaction, were removed from the company’s estate or did not become a part
of the estate.

The measure of insolvency for purposes of fraudulent conveyance laws varies depending on
the law applied. Generally, however, the Polish guarantor would be considered insolvent if it could
not pay its debts as they became due. If a court decided that the guarantee provided by the Polish
guarantor was a fraudulent conveyance and voided such guarantee or Security Interest or held it
unenforceable for any other reason, a holder of the Bonds would cease to have any claim in

340


-----

respect of the Polish guarantor and would be a creditor solely of the Issuer and remaining
guarantors.

_Application of foreign law_

If any obligation is to be performed in a jurisdiction outside the Republic of Poland, it might
not be enforceable in the Republic of Poland, inter alia, to the extent that such performance would
be illegal or contrary to public policy under the laws of the other jurisdiction and a Polish court may
take into account the law of the place of performance when evaluating the manner of performance
and the steps to be taken in the event of defective performance.

**Spain**

**_Certain Insolvency Considerations_**

Certain of the guarantors are incorporated under the laws of the kingdom of Spain (such
guarantors, the ‘‘Spanish guarantors’’). Consequently, in the event of an insolvency of any of the
Spanish guarantors, insolvency proceedings may be initiated in Spain and governed by Spanish
law. The Spanish Act 22/2003 of July 9, 2003 on Insolvency Proceedings, as amended from time to
time (the ‘‘Spanish Insolvency Act’’), regulates court-supervised, out-of-court workouts and court
insolvency proceedings.

_Concept and Petition for Insolvency_

In Spain, insolvency proceedings are only triggered in the event of a debtor’s current
insolvency (insolvencia actual) or imminent insolvency (insolvencia inminente). Under the Spanish
Insolvency Act, a debtor is deemed insolvent when it becomes unable to meet regularly its
obligations as they become due and payable (current insolvency) or when it expects that it will
shortly be unable to do so (imminent insolvency).

A petition for current insolvency may be initiated (i) by the debtor; or (ii) by any creditor
(provided that it has not acquired the claim within the six months prior to the filing of the petition for
insolvency, for intervivos acts, on a singular basis and once the claim was mature); or (iii) by certain
other interested third parties (including the shareholder that is unlimitedly liable for the debtors of
the company). However, only the debtor may file a petition for insolvency on the basis of its
imminent insolvency. Creditors wishing to file a petition for insolvency have the burden of proving
that the debtors is in actual insolvency as further explained below.

_Voluntary Insolvency_

Insolvency is considered voluntary (concurso voluntario) if filed by the debtor.

The debtor is obliged to file a petition for insolvency within two months after it becomes
aware, or should have become aware, of its state of insolvency. It is presumed that the debtor
becomes aware of its state of insolvency, unless otherwise proved, if any of the circumstances that
qualify as the basis for a petition for mandatory insolvency occur.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the general duty to file for insolvency within the referred two
months does not apply, if the debtor, notifies the applicable court that it has initiated negotiations
with its creditors to obtain support to reach, among others, a pre-packaged composition agreement
(propuesta de convenio anticipado) or an out-of-court workout (a refinancing agreement) set out in
Article 71.bis.1 or in the Fourth Additional Disposition of the Spanish Insolvency Act (the so-called
5 bis communication). Effectively, by means of the 5 bis communication, on the top of those two
months, the debtor gains an additional three-month period to achieve an agreement with its
creditors or to obtain accessions to an anticipated composition agreement and one further month

341


-----

to file for the declaration of insolvency, if the above mentioned period of three months has elapsed
without an agreement being reached and the situation of insolvency persists (thus, in total, a
four-months extension). During such period of time, creditors’ petitions for mandatory insolvency will
not be accepted and court or out-of-court enforcement actions, other than those arising from public
law claims, over those assets or rights deemed necessary for the continuity of the debtor’s
business activities, are prohibited or suspended, as applicable. In addition, enforcement
proceedings over any other type of assets that have been brought by creditors holding financial
liabilities (as defined in the Fourth Additional Disposition of the Spanish Insolvency Act) shall be
prohibited or suspended (as applicable) provided that it is evidenced that at least 51% of the
creditors holding financial liabilities (by value) have supported the initiation of negotiations to enter
into a refinancing agreement and have agreed to suspend or not initiate enforcement proceedings
against the debtor while creditors holding financial liabilities are still negotiating. Nevertheless,
secured creditors shall be entitled to bring enforcement proceedings against the corresponding
secured assets although once proceedings have been initiated they shall be immediately
suspended. Once submitted to the court a 5 bis communication, no further communications can be
submitted within one year.

_Mandatory Insolvency_

Insolvency is considered mandatory (concurso necesario) if filed by a third-party creditor or
other entitled party.

Under Article 2.4 of the Spanish Insolvency Act, a creditor can seek a debtor’s declaration of
insolvency if it can prove that it has failed to attach any assets, or sufficient assets, to pay the
amounts owed. A creditor may also apply for a declaration of insolvency if, inter alias (i) there is a
generalised default on payments by the debtor, (ii) there is a seizure of assets affecting or
comprising the generality of the debtor’s assets, (iii) there is a misplacement, ‘‘fire sale’’ or sale or
ruinous liquidation of the debtor’s assets, or (iv) there is a generalised default on certain tax, social
security and employment obligations during the applicable statutory period (three (3) months).

_Conclusion of Insolvency: Proposal of Composition Agreement or Liquidation_

The Spanish Insolvency Act provides that insolvency proceedings conclude following either
the implementation of a composition agreement (convenio) between the creditors and the debtor
(the ‘‘CVA’’) or the liquidation of the debtor.

_Certain Effects of the Insolvency for the Debtor_

As a general rule, subject to certain exceptions, the debtor in a voluntary insolvency retains its
powers to manage and dispose of its business, but is subject to the intervention of the insolvency
administrators (administraci´on concursal). In the case of a mandatory insolvency, as a general rule
and subject to certain exceptions, the debtor no longer has power over its assets, and
management’s powers (including the power to dispose of assets) are conferred solely upon the
insolvency administrators. However, the court has the power to modify this general regime subject
to the specific circumstances of the case. Additionally, upon the insolvency administrator request,
the court has the power to swap the intervention regime for a suspension regime or vice versa.

_Certain Effects of the Insolvency on Contracts_

A declaration of insolvency does not affect agreements with reciprocal obligations pending
performance by either the insolvent party or the counterparty (‘‘executory contracts’’), which remain
in full force and effect, and the obligations of the insolvent debtor will be fulfilled against the
insolvency estate. The court can nonetheless terminate any such contracts at the request of the

342


-----

insolvency administrators (provided that management’s powers have been solely conferred upon
the insolvency administrators) or the debtor itself (if its powers to manage and dispose of its
business are only subject to the intervention of the insolvency administrator), when such termination
is in the interest of the estate (resoluci´on del contrato en inter´es del concurso) or at the request of
the non-insolvent party if there has been a breach of such contract although the judge has
discretion to reject this request. In case that the breach by the insolvent debtor takes place after the
declaration of the insolvency proceedings, the termination of such contracts may result in the
insolvent debtor having to return and indemnify damages to its counterpart against the insolvency
estate (con cargo a la masa). On the other hand, the judge may decide to cure any breach of the
insolvent debtor at its request or the insolvency administrators’ request (assumption)
(mantenimiento del contrato en inter´es del concurso), in which case the non-insolvent party shall be
entitled to seek specific performance against the insolvency estate (pre-deductible claim from the
estate). Lastly, under Article 61 of the Spanish Insolvency Act, all clauses in contracts with mutual
obligations that entitle any party to terminate an agreement based solely on the other party’s
declaration of insolvency are deemed as not included in the agreement (void) and, therefore,
unenforceable, except if expressly permitted by specific laws (e.g. agency laws).

Additionally, the declaration of insolvency determines that interest accrual is suspended,
except credit rights secured with an in rem right, in which case interest accrues up to the value of
the security, and except for any wage credits in favor of employees, which will accrue the legal
interest set forth annually in the corresponding Law of the State Budget (Ley de Presupuestos del
_Estado)._

According to the Spanish Insolvency Act, the insolvency administrator, unilaterally or at the
request of the insolvent debtor, may reinstate (rehabilitaci´on) facility agreements which were
accelerated by the credit as a result of a payment default (of principal or interest) in the three
months preceding the declaration of insolvency, provided that: (i) the insolvency administrator must
serve a notice of the reinstatement to the creditor before the expiry of the term available to
communicate claims (generally, one month from the opening of the insolvency proceedings), and
(ii) the administrator must pay any due amounts and thereafter shall pay any amounts arising from
the credit against the insolvency state. The foregoing will not be applicable if the creditor has
opposed to the reinstatement and has started enforcement proceedings before the declaration of
the insolvency.

Set-off is generally prohibited unless the requirements for set-off were satisfied prior to the
declaration of the insolvency (excluding set-off regarding financial collateral).

_Ranking of Credits_

Creditors are required to report their claims to the insolvency administrators within one month
from the day following the last official publication of the court order declaring the insolvency,
providing documentation to justify such claims. Based on the documentation provided by the
creditors and documentation held by the debtor, the insolvency administrators draw up a list of
acknowledged creditors/claims and classify them according to the categories established in the
Spanish Insolvency Act. Not reporting the claims in a timely manner can entail serious
consequences for the creditors (including the subordination of their claims).

Under the Spanish Insolvency Act, claims are classified in two groups:

   - Estate Claims (cr´editos contra la masa): Article 84 of the Spanish Insolvency Act sets out the
so-called ‘‘estate claims’’ which are pre-deductible claims from the estate (excluding those
assets of the insolvent debtor subject to in rem security). Debt against the insolvency estate
includes, among others, (i) certain amounts of the employee payroll, (ii) costs and expenses
of the insolvency proceedings, (iii) certain amounts arising from services provided to the

343


-----

insolvent debtor under reciprocal contracts and outstanding obligations that remain in force
after insolvency proceedings are declared and deriving from obligations to return and
indemnify in cases of voluntary termination or breach by the insolvent debtor, (iv) those that
derive from the exercise of a clawback action within the insolvency proceedings of acts
performed by the insolvent debtor and correspond to a refund of consideration received by
it (except in cases of bad faith), (v) certain amounts arising from obligations created by law
or from the non-contractual liability of the insolvent debtor after the declaration of insolvency
and until its conclusion, (vi) certain debts incurred by the debtor following the declaration of
insolvency; (vii) in case of liquidation, the credit rights granted to the debtor under a
composition agreement in accordance with Article 100.5 of the Spanish Insolvency Act,
(viii) 50% of the new funds lent under a refinancing arrangement entered into in compliance
with the requirements set forth in Article 71.bis or the 4th Additional Provision of the Spanish
Insolvency Act.

- Insolvency Claims: Insolvency claims are classified as follows:

a) Specially Privileged Claims: Creditors benefiting from special privileges,
representing security over certain assets (in rem securities) up to the amount of the
value of their security, provided that such security is listed in the creditors’ list (in
this regard, the value of a security shall be 90% of the reasonable value of the
secured asset determined in accordance with the rules provided for in the Spanish
Insolvency Act minus those claims that hold higher ranking security over such
asset). The part of the claim exceeding the value of their security will be classified
according to the nature of the claim. These claims benefiting from special privileges
may entail separate proceedings, though subject to certain restrictions derived from
a waiting period that may last up to one year from the declaration of the insolvency
and certain additional limitations set forth in the Spanish Insolvency Act (see Certain
_Effects of the Insolvency on enforcement of collateral). However, within such waiting_
period or while any enforcement proceedings remain suspended under the Spanish
Insolvency Act, the insolvency administrator has the option to pay the relevant
claims against the insolvency estate under specific payment rules. Privileged
creditors are not subject to the CVA unless they give their express support by
voting in favor of the CVA or, in case they do not give such express support, if
creditors holding security which represent at least 60% (or 75% depending on the
conditions of the composition agreement) of the total value of secured claims of the
same class vote in favor of such composition agreement. In the event of liquidation,
they are the first to collect payment against the assets on which they are secured.

b) Generally Privileged Claims: Creditors benefiting from a general privilege,
including, among others, specific labor and social security claims, specific claims
brought by public entities or authorities (up to half their amount), claims for
non-contractual liability (tort) and claims held by the creditor taking the initiative to
apply for the insolvency proceedings, for up to 50% of the amount of such debt. It
should be understood that new funds under a refinancing arrangement entered into
in compliance with the requirements set forth in Article 71.bis and the 4th Additional
Provision of the Spanish Insolvency Act in the amount not admitted as a debt
against the insolvency estate (cr´edito contra la masa) are also credits with general
privilege. The holders of general privileges are not to be affected by the CVA except
if they give their express support by voting in favor of the CVA or, in the case they
do not give such express support, if creditors holding claims benefiting from
general privileges which represent at least 60% (or 75% depending on the
conditions of the composition agreement) of the total value of claims benefiting

344


-----

from general privileges of the same class vote in favor of such composition
agreement. In the event of liquidation, they will collect payment, in accordance with
the ranking established under the Spanish Insolvency Act.

c) Ordinary Claims: Ordinary creditors (non-subordinated and non-privileged claims)
are paid pro rata once estate claims and privileged claims have been paid.

d) Subordinated Claims: Subordinated creditors (thus classified by virtue of an
agreement or pursuant to law), include, among others: with some exceptions,
credits communicated late (outside the specific one-month period mentioned
above); credits which are contractually subordinated vis-`a-vis all other credits of the
debtor; credits relating to unpaid interest claims (including default interest) except
for those credits secured with an in rem right up to the value of the security; fines;
claims resulting from claw-back actions where the relevant creditor acted in bad
faith, claims of creditors which are ‘‘specially related parties’’ to the insolvent debtor
and claims arising out of executory contracts where the court rules that the relevant
creditor has repeatedly obstructed compliance thereof.

In the case of individuals, the following shall be deemed to be ‘‘specially related parties’’
(i) debtor’s relatives; (ii) legal entities controlled by the debtor or its relatives and the factual or legal
administrators of such legal entities; (iii) any other legal entity forming part of the same group of the
companies referred to in (ii) and the legal entities in respect of which the people described in this
paragraph are their factual and legal administrators.

In the case of a legal entity, the following shall be deemed as ‘‘specially related parties’’:
(i) shareholders with unlimited liability (in case such shareholders are natural persons it would
include any specially related party to these shareholders, as described herein); (ii) limited liability
shareholders holding at the time of accrual of the relevant claim or credit, directly or indirectly, 10%
or more of the insolvent company’s share capital (or 5% if the company’ securities are listed); or
(iii) directors (either de jure or de facto) liquidators and those holding general powers of attorney
from the insolvent company (including those people that have held these position during the two
years prior to the insolvency declaration); and (iv) companies pertaining to the same group as the
debtor and their common shareholders provided such shareholders meet the minimum
shareholding requirements set forth in (ii) above. Notwithstanding the above, creditors who have
directly or indirectly capitalized their credit rights pursuant to a refinancing arrangement entered into
in compliance with the requirements set forth in Article 71.bis or the 4th Additional Provision of the
Spanish Insolvency Act, an out of court payment plan (acuerdo extrajudicial de pagos) or a CVA
shall not be considered as being in a special relationship with the debtor, in respect of credits
against the debtor, as a result of the financing granted under such relevant refinancing
arrangement. Furthermore, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, assignees or awardees of
claims belonging to any of the persons mentioned in this paragraph are presumed to be persons
specially related to the insolvent debtor as long as the acquisition has taken place within two years
prior to the insolvency proceedings being declared open.

Subordinated creditors are second-level creditors. They do not vote on the CVA and in the
event of liquidation collect payment according to the ranking established in the Spanish Insolvency
Act (once ordinary creditors have been paid in full).

_Hardening Periods_

There is no automatic claw-back by operation of law. Therefore, there are no prior transactions
that automatically become void as a result of the initiation of insolvency proceedings. Under the
Spanish Insolvency Act, upon the declaration of insolvency, only transactions that could be deemed
as having damaged (perjudiciales) the insolvent debtor’s estate (i.e., causing a so-called

345


-----

‘‘patrimonial damage’’) during the two years prior to the date on which the insolvency is declared,
may be challenged. Transactions taking place earlier than two years prior to the declaration of
insolvency may be rescinded subject to ordinary Spanish Civil Code based actions.

The Spanish Insolvency Act does not define the meaning of ‘‘patrimonial damage’’. Damage
does not refer to the intention of the parties, but to the consequences of the transaction on the
debtor’s interest or on the equality of treatment among creditors. There are several ‘‘irrebuttable
presumptions’’ expressly set forth by the Spanish Insolvency Act (i.e., free disposals, gifts or acts
for no consideration and prepayment or cancellation of the debtor’s unsecured claims or
obligations prior to them being due and where the due dates of the relevant unsecured claims or
payment obligations fall after the date of declaration of insolvency), in which case such transactions
are rescinded if they are challenged and fall within the hardening period. In addition to the above,
the Spanish Insolvency Act sets forth certain actions which are deemed to cause a ‘‘patrimonial
damage’’ to the insolvent company, but which are ‘‘rebuttable presumptions’’ and therefore subject
to being contested by the other party (i.e., disposals in favor of ‘‘specially related parties’’ (as
described above), the provision of security in respect of previously existing obligations or in respect
of new obligations replacing existing ones and the prepayment and cancellation of the company’s
secured claims or obligations which fall due after the date of declaration of insolvency).

Under no circumstances can be rescinded (i) ordinary transactions carried out within the
debtor’s ordinary course of the business provided that they are carried out at arm’s length;
(ii) actions contemplated in the specific legislation regarding systems of payment, set-off or
liquidation of values and derivative instruments, and (iii) guarantees constituted in favour of Public
Law credits or credits in favour of the labour authorities.

_Protection of Refinancing Agreements_

Certain refinancing agreements may be protected from claw-back risk provided that they
comply with certain requirements further explained in the section referred to as ‘‘Cramdown effects
of certain refinancing agreements’’. However, in the case that such refinancing agreements are not
subject to the procedure of judicial sanctioning therein described (homologaci´on), in order to
benefit from such protection they must be backed by at least [3]⁄5 of the total claims of the insolvent
debtor (calculated on an individual and on a consolidated basis but excluding intragroup claims),
which shall be certified by the auditor of the relevant debtor. The refinancing agreements must be
founded on a viability plan reflecting that the insolvent debtor will be viable in the short and
medium term and must comply with the rest of requirements explained below (see Cramdown
_Effects of Certain Refinancing Agreements)._

_Fraudulent Conveyance Laws_

Under Spanish law, the insolvency administrator and any creditor may bring an action to
rescind a contract or agreement against its debtor and the third party which is a party to such
contract or agreement, provided the same is performed or entered into fraudulently and the creditor
cannot obtain payment of the amounts owed in any other way.

Although case law is not entirely consistent, it is broadly accepted that the following
requirements must be met in order for a creditor to bring such action:

   - the debtor owes the creditor an amount under a valid contract and the fraudulent action
took place after such debt was created;

   - the debtor has carried out an act that is detrimental to the creditor and beneficial to the third
party;

   - such act was fraudulent;

346


-----

   - there is no other legal remedy available to the creditor to obtain compensation for the
damages suffered; and

   - debtor’s insolvency, construed as the situation where there has been a relevant decrease in
the debtor’s estate making it impossible or more difficult to collect the claim.

The existence of fraud (which must be evidenced by the creditor) is one of the essential
requirements under Spanish law for the action to rescind to succeed. Pursuant to Article 1,297 of
the Spanish Civil Code: (i) agreements by virtue of which the debtor transfers assets for no
consideration and (ii) transfers for consideration carried out by parties who have been held liable by
a court (sentencia condenatoria) or whose assets have been subject to a writ of attachment
(mandamiento de embargo) will be considered fraudulent.

If the rescission action were to be upheld, the third party would be liable to return the
consideration received under the contract in order to satisfy the debt owed to the creditor.
Following that, the creditor would need to carry out the actions necessary to obtain the amount
owed by the debtor. If the consideration received by the third party under the contract cannot be
returned to the debtor, the third party must indemnify the creditor for such damages.

_Cramdown Effects of Certain Refinancing Agreements_

In order to seek protection against claw-back, refinancing agreements (out-of-court workouts)
can also be judicially sanctioned (homologado) by the commercial court that will be competent to
conduct an eventual insolvency proceedings of the debtor, upon request by the debtor or by any
creditor having entered into such refinancing agreements, provided that, among other requirements,
(i) they entail a significant enlargement of debtor’s credit or a change in the debt structure by either
granting a longer term or replacing previous claims with new ones, all these in accordance with a
viability plan enabling the continuity of the debtor business activity in the short and medium term;
(ii) they have been subscribed by creditors holding financial liabilities representing, at least, 51% of
the debtor’s financial liabilities whether or not subject to financial supervision (that is to say the
Spanish Insolvency Act excludes public creditors, labor creditors and those of commercial
transactions in order to calculate whether the required thresholds are met) at the date of the
refinancing agreement; (iii) the debtor’s auditor issues a certificate acknowledging that the required
thresholds have been reached (in the case of a group a companies, the majority refers both
individually to each company and to the group as a whole -where the intercompany claims are not
taken into account-); and (iv) the agreement is formalized in a public instrument. Judicially
sanctioned refinancing agreements may not be subject to a claw-back action, but may be
challenged in certain cases (i.e., in case of breach of formalities or in case they impose
disproportionate sacrifices on dissenting creditors).

As to the rules to calculate whether the required thresholds have been reached, all creditors
holding an interest in a syndicated loan will be deemed to have adhered to the refinancing
agreement (for the purposes of petitioning protection against claw-back) if it is favorably voted upon
by at least 75% of the liabilities represented by the loan, or a lower majority if so established in the
syndicated loan agreement. The scope of this measure (particularly as to whether this majority of
75% might also serve for the cramdown of discharges and stays of payments over the rest of
syndicated claims) is not clear among Spanish scholars or courts and therefore it is not possible
yet to ascertain what its practical effects will be.

The following cramdown effects of homologated refinancing agreements may be imposed on
(i) dissenting or non-participating unsecured financial creditors including secured financial creditors
to the extent of that part of their secured claim not covered by their security interest, as such
security interest is to be valued in accordance with the rules set out by the latest reform of the

347


-----

Spanish Insolvency Act and (ii) dissenting secured creditors in respect of their secured claims,
provided they achieve the thresholds mentioned below:

a) If the judicially sanctioned refinancing agreement is supported by creditors representing
at least 60% of the debtor’s financial liabilities, stays of payments may be granted for up
to five years or the debt converted into so-called profit participation loans (pr´estamos
_participativos) of duration up to 5 years._

Further, these effects may be extended to the amount of secured claims of
non-participating or dissenting creditors, when the agreement has been entered into by
financial creditors holding secured claims which represent at least 65% of the value of all
secured claims of the debtor.

b) If the homologated refinancing agreement is supported by creditors representing at least
75% of the debtor’s aggregate financial liabilities:

(i) stays of payments for up to ten years;

(ii) uncapped haircuts;

(iii) capitalization of debt. Nevertheless, those creditors that have not supported such
refinancing agreement (either because they did not sign the agreement or because
they oppose it) may choose between (i) the debt for equity swap contemplated by
the agreement; or (ii) a discharge of their claims equal to the nominal amount
(including any share premium) of the shares/quota shares that would have
corresponded to that creditor as a consequence of the relevant debt for equity
swap;

(iv) conversion of debt into profit participation loans of up to ten years, convertible
obligations, subordinated loans, payment in kind facilities, or in any other financial
instrument with a ranking, maturity and features different to the original debt; and

(v) assignment of assets or rights as assignment in kind for total or partial payment of
the debt (datio pro soluto).

Further, these effects may be extended to the amount of secured claims of
non-participating or dissenting creditors, when the agreement has been entered into by
financial creditors holding secured claims which represent at least 80% of the value of all
secured claims of the debtor.

The calculation of the thresholds referred to above is not always straightforward and some
uncertainties are yet to be solved by the courts (for instance, in respect of the inclusion or
exclusion of contingent debt). Grounds for opposition by dissenting creditors are limited to an error
in the calculation of these thresholds or the imposition of a disproportionate sacrifice upon the
dissenting creditor.

_Applicable Jurisdiction_

The applicable jurisdiction to conduct an insolvency proceeding is the one in which the
insolvent party has its ‘‘center of main interests’’. This ‘‘center of main interests’’ is deemed to be
where the insolvent party conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and which
may be recognized as such by third parties. Insolvency proceedings conducted by the court of the
‘‘center of main interests’’ are considered ‘‘the principal insolvency proceedings’’ and have
universal reach affecting all the assets of the insolvent party worldwide. If the ‘‘center of main
interests’’ is not in Spain, but the insolvent party has a permanent establishment in Spain, Spanish

348


-----

courts will only have jurisdiction over the assets located in Spain (the ‘‘territorial insolvency
proceedings’’).

In the event Spanish courts have jurisdiction, Article 87.3 of the current Spanish Insolvency Act
may apply, in which case the claims of the beneficiaries of the guarantee provided by the Spanish
guarantor may be classified as ‘‘contingent’’ claims and no amount may be recognized until and
when a default occurs and the guarantee is validly enforced. Special rules can apply if the
guarantee is not a first demand guarantee but an ordinary guarantee (fianza) and, therefore, the
benefits of preference (excusi´on), order (orden) and division (divisi´on) apply.

_Further amendments of the Spanish Insolvency Act_

Further amendments of the Spanish Insolvency Act may be approved in the short term if the
proposal for a consolidated text of the Spanish Insolvency Law, which has been recently made by
the Spanish General Codifying Commission, comes into force. At the date hereof, the final text of
these amendments and whether or not this proposal will succeed is still unclear.

**_General Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of Undertakings and Guarantees_**

The obligations under the notes, the guarantees or might not necessarily be enforced in
accordance with their respective terms in every circumstance, such enforcement being subject to,
_inter alia, the nature of the remedies available in the Spanish Courts, the acceptance by such court_
of jurisdiction, the discretion of the courts, the power of such courts to stay proceedings, the
availability of defenses such as (without limitation) set-off (unless validly waived), circumvention of
law (fraude de ley), abuse in the exercise of rights (abuso de derecho), misrepresentation, force
majeure, unforeseen circumstances, undue influence, duress, abatement and counterclaim, the
provisions of the Spanish Law on Civil Procedure regarding remedies and enforcement measures
available under Spanish law, the provisions of the Spanish Insolvency Act and other principles of
law of general application. In this regard:

   - Spanish law does not expressly recognize the concept of an indemnity. Article 1,152 of the
Spanish Civil Code establishes that any penalty (cl´ausula penal) agreed by the parties in an
agreement will substitute damages (indemnizaci´on de da˜nos) and the payment of interest
(abono de intereses) in an event of breach, unless otherwise agreed. Spanish Courts may
modify the penalty agreed on an equitable basis if the debtor has partially or irregularly
performed its obligations, unless the penalty (liquidated damages) was aimed at such partial
performance. There is doubt as to the enforceability in Spain of punitive damages.

   - Where obligations are to be performed in a jurisdiction outside Spain, they may not be
enforceable in Spain to the extent that performance would be illegal under the laws of the
applicable jurisdiction.

   - Spanish law precludes the validity and performance of contractual obligations to be left at
the discretion of one of the contracting parties. Therefore, Spanish courts may refuse to
uphold and enforce terms and conditions of an agreement giving discretionary authority to
one of the contracting parties.

   - Spanish law, as applied by the Spanish Supreme Court, precludes an agreement being
terminated on the basis of a breach of obligations, undertakings or covenants which are
merely ancillary or complementary to the main undertakings foreseen under the relevant
agreement (such as payment obligations under financing agreements), and allows Spanish
courts not to enforce any such termination.

   - Under Spanish law, acts carried out in accordance with the terms of a legal provision
whenever said acts seek a result which is forbidden by or contrary to law, shall be deemed

349


-----

to have been executed in circumvention of law (fraude de ley) and the provisions whose
application was intended to be avoided shall apply.

   - A Spanish court may not accept acceleration (vencimiento anticipado) of an agreement if
the default were of minimal importance. To be recognized by the Spanish courts as giving
rise to the remedy of acceleration, a default must be material. The decision to accelerate an
agreement must be based on objective facts and cannot be left to the sole discretion of one
party as this would not be permitted by article 1,256 of the Spanish Civil Code.

   - Under Spanish law, claims may become time-barred (claims arisen from obligations in
personam will be generally time-barred to 5 years) or may be or become subject to the
defense of set-off or counterclaim.

The terms ‘‘enforceable’’, ‘‘enforceability’’, ‘‘valid’’, ‘‘legal’’, ‘‘binding’’ and ‘‘effective’’ (or any
combination thereof) mean that all of the obligations assumed by the relevant party under the
relevant documents are of a type enforced by Spanish courts; the terms do not mean that these
obligations will necessarily be enforced in all circumstances in accordance with their terms.

Spanish law prohibits financial assistance: (i) for stock companies (sociedades an´onimas) in
relation to the acquisition of their own shares or the shares of any direct or indirect parent
company, and (ii) for limited liability companies (sociedades de responsabilidad limitada), in relation
to the acquisition of their own shares and the shares of any member of their corporate group.
Therefore, Spanish law governed guarantees or security interests granted by subsidiaries
incorporated under the laws of Spain shall not extend to any payment obligation incurred by the
Issuer for the purpose of acquiring the shares of such Spanish subsidiary or the shares of its direct
or indirect parent company or, as applicable, any member of their group, to the extent that such
security interest would constitute unlawful financial assistance within the meaning of Article 150 and
143 of Spanish Decree 1/2010 dated July 2 on Spanish Corporations (Ley de Sociedades de
Capital). This limitation may also apply to the refinancing of acquisition debt, although this is widely
debated between academics. Accordingly, any guarantee or security interest granted by any
Spanish subsidiary shall not apply to the extent the proceeds are used to repay existing
indebtedness of the Issuer if such existing indebtedness was used for the purposes described
above. No whitewash procedures are available. Accordingly, the guarantee granted by any Spanish
company will be limited by the amount of the funds that are not used for unlawful financial
assistance purposes.

In general terms, under Spanish law, any guarantee must guarantee a primary obligation to
which it is ancillary. The primary obligation must be clearly identified in the guarantee, and the
nullity or termination of the primary obligation entails the nullity or termination of the ancillary
guarantee. Consequently, if the primary obligation is deemed null and void, the ancillary guarantee
will also be deemed null and void. In the event that the guarantor is able to prove that there are no
existing and valid guaranteed obligations, Spanish courts may consider that the guarantor’s
obligations under the relevant guarantee are not enforceable. In addition, a guarantee may not be
enforced in Spain without having validly accelerated the underlying agreements governing the
guaranteed or secured obligations, and may be affected by any amendment, supplement, waiver,
repayment, novation or extinction of the secured obligations.

Moreover, Spanish law may limit the ability of a Spanish guarantor to guarantee the notes.
Recent Spanish case law indicates, and certain scholars understand, that risk associated with a
guarantee provided by a Spanish company to guarantee held by other companies within its
corporate group must be reasonable and justified under the corporate interest of such company.
Whenever there is a conflict between the interest of the group and the interest of a subsidiary, a
‘‘reasonable balance’’ must be reached between them so to make possible the efficient and flexible
management of the group without depriving the subsidiaries from their resources. Such balance

350


-----

can be found in the existence of advantages direct or indirect (even if not simultaneous to the
granting of the guarantee) which may compensate the damage suffered or to be suffered by the
company. Said compensation must have an economic value and be proportional to the damage
suffered. In any case, there is a limit, which is the continuity or viability of the company.

**Sweden**

**_Certain Insolvency Considerations_**

_Applicable Insolvency Law_

As follows from the section ‘‘—European Union’’ above, a Swedish entity will in principle be
subject to insolvency proceedings covered by the EU Insolvency Regulation if it has its center of
main interest in Sweden. One of the guarantors is incorporated under the laws of Sweden and as
such any insolvency proceedings applicable to such guarantor including any and all of its assets (in
Sweden and abroad) will, as a starting point and by virtue of Article 4 of the EU Insolvency
Regulation, be governed by Swedish insolvency law (lex fori concursus).

_Insolvency Proceedings_

Pursuant to the Swedish Bankruptcy Act (konkurslagen (1987:672)), if a company is unable to
pay its debts when due and such inability is not merely temporary, it is deemed insolvent and can
be declared bankrupt following a bankruptcy petition filed with the court by (i) the company or
(ii) by a creditor of the company.

In the event of bankruptcy of a Swedish company the court will appoint a receiver in
bankruptcy (konkursf¨orvaltare) who will work in the interest of all creditors of the company with the
objective of selling the company’s assets and distribute the proceeds among the creditors.

The purpose of bankruptcy proceedings is to wind up the company in such a way that the
company’s creditors receive as high a proportion of their claims as possible. The receiver in
bankruptcy is required to safeguard the assets and can decide to continue the business or to close
it down, depending on what is best for all creditors. In general, the receiver in bankruptcy is
required to sell the assets of the company as soon as possible and to distribute the proceeds in
accordance with the mandatory priority rules as primarily set out in the Swedish Rights of Priority
Act, as amended (Sw. F¨orm˚ansr¨attslagen (1970:979)) (the ‘‘Rights of Priority Act’’). In the interim,
the receiver in bankruptcy will take over the management and control of the company and the
company’s directors and/or managing director will no longer be entitled to represent the company
or dispose of the company’s assets.

A declaration of bankruptcy does not automatically terminate existing contracts; instead, the
receiver in bankruptcy may in its discretion choose to have the bankruptcy estate itself step into
any such existing contracts. A clause in a contract which provides that the contract is terminated by
reason of bankruptcy proceedings or similar is likely to be unenforceable (the bankruptcy estate
shall always be given a right to fulfill the company’s obligations according to a contract). If the
bankruptcy estate steps into the contract and performance by the creditor is due, the creditor may
demand that the bankruptcy estate performs its newly assumed obligations as well or, if a grace
period has been granted, request that the bankruptcy estate, without unreasonable delay, provides
acceptable security for its performance. If performance by the creditor is not due, the creditor may
request security where this is necessary in order to protect it against loss. If the bankruptcy estate
does not step into the contract within a reasonable time after the creditor’s demand or if it does not
comply with the creditor’s request to provide security, the creditor may terminate the contract.

351


-----

_Enforcement Process_

In case of enforcement outside of bankruptcy proceedings, an enforcement process is initiated
by the creditor obtaining an enforcement order from the Swedish Enforcement Authority
(Sw. Kronofogden) or the courts. Upon obtaining an enforcement order against a company, a
creditor may apply to the Swedish Enforcement Authority for enforcement of its claim.

_Priority of Certain Creditors_

As a general principle, under Swedish insolvency law competing claims have equal right to
payment in relation to the size of the amount claimed from the company’s assets. However, some
preferential and secured creditors, where such preference or security may arise as a consequence
of law, have the benefit of payment before all other creditors (in the case of preferential creditors
only) and all unsecured creditors out of the assets that secure the creditors’ claims (in the case of
secured creditors only). There are two types of preferential rights: specific and general preferential
rights. Specific preferential rights apply to certain specific property and give the creditor a right to
payment from such property. General preferential rights cover all property belonging to the insolvent
company’s estate in bankruptcy, which is not covered by specific preferential rights, and give the
creditor a right to payment from such property. Claims that do not carry any of the above
mentioned preferential rights or exceed the value of the security provided for such claim (to the
extent of such excess), are non-preferential and are of equal standing as against each other (unless
subordinated). A claim can be subordinated if, for instance, the creditor has entered into an
agreement with the company stipulating such subordination. It should be noted that, in the case of
bankruptcy, claims in relation to the bankruptcy estate (a legal entity separate from the company)
due to costs relating to the bankruptcy (including fees payable to the receiver in bankruptcy), may
have priority over claims in relation to the company.

_Challengeable Transactions_

In Swedish bankruptcy and, if certain conditions are met, company reorganization
proceedings, transactions can (in certain circumstances and subject to a time limit) be reversed
and the assets being the subject of such transaction can then be returned to the bankruptcy estate
or the company subject to company reorganization. Broadly, these transactions include, among
others, situations where the company has conveyed property fraudulently or preferentially to one
creditor to the detriment of its other creditors before the initiation of the relevant insolvency
proceedings, created a new security interest or provided a guarantee that was either not stipulated
at the time when the secured obligation arose or not perfected without delay after such time and
the delay is not considered to be ordinary, or paid a debt that is not due or that is considerable
compared to the value of the company’s assets or if the payment is made by using unusual means
of payment. In the majority of situations, a claim for recovery can be made concerning actions that
were made during three or six months preceding the commencement of the relevant Swedish
insolvency proceedings. In certain situations, longer time limits apply and in others there are no
time limits. These include, among others, situations where the other party to a transaction is
deemed to be a closely-related party to the company such as a subsidiary or parent company.

_Limitations on Enforceability Due to the Swedish Reorganization Act_

The Swedish Reorganization Act (Sw. Lag (1996:764) om f¨oretagsrekonstruktion) provides
companies facing difficulties in meeting their payment obligations with an opportunity to resolve
these difficulties without being declared bankrupt. A petition for company reorganization may be
presented to the court by the company or a creditor of the company but a reorganization order
may only be granted subject to the company’s approval. Corporate reorganization proceedings

352


-----

shall, as a main rule, terminate within three months from commencement but may under certain
conditions be extended for up to one year.

An administrator (Sw. rekonstrukt¨or) is appointed by the court and supervises the day-to-day
activities and safeguards the interests of creditors as well as the company. However, the company
remains in full possession of the business except that the consent of the administrator is required
for important decisions such as paying a debt that has fallen due prior to the granting of a
reorganization order, granting security for a debt that arose prior to the granting of the
reorganization order, undertaking new obligations or transferring, pledging or granting rights in
respect of assets of a substantial value for the company’s business. However, the absence of such
consent does not affect the validity of the transaction (but may jeopardize the reorganization).

Upon the opening of corporate reorganization proceedings, the administrator must notify the
creditors of the reorganization proceedings and will draw up a reorganization plan specifying the
proposed action to be taken to resolve the company’s difficulties. A creditors’ meeting will be held
at which the creditors will be given the opportunity to express their opinions as to whether the
reorganization should continue. Upon the request of any of the creditors, the court shall appoint a
creditors’ committee composed of a maximum of three persons. The administrator shall, if possible,
consult with the creditors’ committee prior to taking any important decisions.

The corporate reorganization proceedings do not have the effect of terminating contracts
entered into by the company. However, the opening of corporate reorganization proceedings entails
limitations on the contracting party’s right to terminate a contract due to the company’s delay in
payment or performance. Such limitations are similar to that which is stated above in respect of a
bankruptcy estate’s right to step into existing contracts. The limitations are not applicable where a
creditor has security over, inter alia, financial instruments or receivables originating from a loan
granted by a credit institution. During the reorganization procedure, the company’s business
activities continue in the ordinary course of business. However, the procedure includes a
suspension of payments to creditors and the company may not pay a debt that fell due prior to the
granting of the reorganization order without the consent of the administrator and such consent may
only be granted should there be exceptional reasons for doing so and any petition for bankruptcy
in respect of the company will be stayed. A moratorium also applies to execution in respect of a
claim or enforcement of security during corporate reorganization proceedings unless the security
assets are in the physical possession of the secured creditor or any agent acting on behalf of such
creditor.

The company may apply to the courts requesting public composition proceedings
(Sw. offentligt ackord) which means that the amount of a creditor’s claim may be reduced on a
percentage basis. The proposal for a public composition must meet certain requirements such as
that a sufficient proportion of the creditors which are allowed to vote, in respect of a sufficient
proportion of the outstanding claims, vote in favor of such public composition. Creditors with set-off
rights and creditors with preferential rights will not participate in the composition unless they wholly
or partly waive their set-off rights or preferential rights. Should the assets in which a creditor has
specific preferential rights not cover such creditor’s full claim, the remaining claim will, however, be
part of a composition. A creditors’ meeting is convened to vote on the proposed composition. The
public composition is binding on all creditors that were entitled to participate, i.e. creditors who
have not attended the creditors’ meeting will also be bound. However, the obligations of a
guarantor under a guarantee provided in respect of a creditor’s claim which has been reduced by
way of public composition will not be reduced correspondingly but will remain valid up to the
original amount of such creditor’s claim.

353

_Liquidation Due to Capital Deficiency_

Pursuant to the Swedish Companies Act (Sw. aktiebolagslag (2005:551)), as amended (the
‘‘Swedish Companies Act’’), whenever a company’s board of directors has a reason to assume
that, as a result of losses or reductions in the value of the company’s assets or any other event, the
company’s equity is less than half the registered share capital, the company’s board of directors
shall prepare a special balance sheet (Sw. kontrollbalansr¨akning) and have the auditors examine it.
The same obligation arises if the company in connection with enforcement pursuant to Chapter 4 of
the Swedish Enforcement Code (Sw. uts¨okningsbalken (1981:774)) is found to lack seizable assets.

If the special balance sheet shows that the equity of the company is less than half of the
registered share capital, the board of directors shall, as soon as possible, issue a notice to call a
shareholders’ meeting which shall consider whether the company shall go into liquidation (initial
_shareholders’ meeting). The special balance sheet and an auditor’s report with respect thereto shall_
be presented at the initial shareholders’ meeting.

If the special balance sheet presented at the initial shareholders’ meeting fails to show that, on
the date of such meeting, the equity of the company amounts to the registered share capital and
the initial shareholders’ meeting has not resolved that the company shall go into liquidation, the
shareholders’ meeting shall, within eight months of the initial shareholders’ meeting, reconsider the
issue of whether the company shall go into liquidation (second shareholders’ meeting). Prior to the
second shareholders’ meeting, the board of directors shall prepare a new special balance sheet
and cause such to be reviewed by the company’s auditors. The new special balance sheet and an
auditor’s report thereon shall be presented at the second shareholders’ meeting.

A shareholders’ resolution on liquidation of the company shall be registered with the Swedish
Companies Registration Office (Sw. Bolagsverket), which shall appoint a liquidator. Should the
shareholders not resolve on such voluntary liquidation where required (which is where (i) a second
shareholders’ meeting is not held within the period of time stated above, or (ii) the new special
balance sheet which was presented at the second shareholders’ meeting was not reviewed by the
company’s auditor or fails to show that, on the date of such meeting, the equity of the company
amounts to at least the registered share capital), the court may put the company into compulsory
liquidation and appoint a liquidator. The liquidator takes over management and control of the
company and shall sell the company’s assets and settle the company’s debts with the proceeds.
The liquidator shall give notice to the company’s unknown creditors and creditors that have not
lodged their claims with the liquidator within six months following such notice will have forfeited
their rights to their claims.

_Foreign Currency_

Whereas Swedish courts may award judgments in currencies other than Swedish krona,
judgments will be enforced in Swedish krona, generally at the rate of exchange prevailing at the
date of enforcement rather than at the date of judgment.

_Trust_

Currently, Swedish law does not contain any provisions for trusts to be formed and trustees to
be appointed. While Swedish law does not know the concept of trust, it is generally believed that a
trustee appointed under foreign law, provided that a trustee is capable of being appointed under
the laws governing such appointment, will be recognized and acknowledged in Sweden in that
such an appointed trustee may be able to claim and enforce or procure the enforcement of the
rights of the beneficiaries under the trust, subject to the terms of the relevant documents.

354


-----

**_Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees_**

Certain provisions of the Swedish Companies Act (Sw. Aktiebolagslag (2005:551)) may limit
the holders of the notes’ right to payment from the Swedish guarantor.

A Swedish limited liability company may not provide a guarantee for the obligations of a
parent or sister company, unless they belong to the same group of companies and the parent
company of that group is domiciled within the EEA, or unless the guarantee is intended exclusively
for the borrower’s business operations and is provided for purely commercial reasons.

Furthermore, if a Swedish limited liability company provides any guarantee without receiving
sufficient corporate benefit in return, such guarantee will, in whole or in part, be considered a
distribution of assets, which will be lawful only (i) to the extent there is sufficient coverage for the
restricted equity capital of the Swedish limited liability company after the distribution (i.e., at the
time the guarantee is provided) (where the aggregate amount available for distribution during the
period from the annual general meeting until the following year’s annual general meeting shall be
calculated on the basis of the balance sheet approved by the shareholders at the first annual
general meeting, taking into account changes in the restricted equity capital after such annual
general meeting) and (ii) if considered prudent by the Swedish limited liability company to
undertake such distribution after having taken into consideration the equity requirements imposed
by the nature, scope and risks relating to the Swedish limited liability company’s business or the
Swedish limited liability company’s need to strengthen its balance sheet, liquidity or financial
position in general. Where the Swedish limited liability company is a parent company, the latter
assessment is also made on a group level.

It should also be noted that laws relating to financial assistance in Sweden prohibit limited
liability companies incorporated in Sweden from providing guarantees or security interests for
obligations of any person where such obligations are being incurred for the purpose of acquiring
shares in the company itself or in any other superior member of the same Swedish group of
companies.

The guarantees granted by the Swedish guarantor are limited in accordance with the above
restrictions relating to corporate benefit, distribution of assets and financial assistance and are
subject to limitation language limiting the liability of such entities thereunder if required by the
above restrictions.

**Switzerland**

**_Certain Insolvency Considerations_**

_Switzerland_

The following is only a general description of possible insolvency and bankruptcy scenarios
with respect to any of the guarantors organized under Swiss law (such guarantors, the ‘‘Swiss
guarantors’’). Most of Swiss bankruptcy and insolvency law is governed by the Swiss Federal Act
on Debt Enforcement and Bankruptcy of April 11, 1889, as amended (for purposes of this
subsection the ‘‘Bankruptcy Act’’). Generally, bankruptcy proceedings recognize the separation of
legal entities, even if the bankrupt company is a wholly owned subsidiary within a group of
companies. Therefore, only the assets of the bankrupt company are subject to the bankruptcy
proceedings.

**_Debt Collection Proceedings_**

In many cases, procedures for collecting monetary debts are opened by debt collection
proceedings. The creditor has to complete a simple form and file it with the competent Debt

355


-----

Collection Office in Switzerland (Betreibungsamt). Thereupon, the Debt Collection Office will issue to
the debtor a so called writ for payment (Zahlungsbefehl). Usually, the debtor raises opposition to
the writ, in which case the debt collection proceedings are stopped until the creditor has an
enforceable judgment in its favor. Debt collection is continued by a specific request for continuance
which in case of the debtor being a corporation usually leads to bankruptcy proceedings.

_Bankruptcy Proceedings_

Most bankruptcy proceedings are preceded by a debt collection proceeding. Upon receipt of
a request for continuance (as discussed in the preceding subsection), the debtor will be served the
so- called threat of bankruptcy (Konkursandrohung). No less than twenty days after that, the creditor
can file a petition for bankruptcy (Konkursbegehren) with the competent bankruptcy court
(Konkursgericht), leading to a summary court proceeding in which bankruptcy is adjudicated or the
case is dismissed.

With the adjudication of bankruptcy (Konkurser¨offnung), the debtor is no longer entitled to and
capable of disposing of the debtor’s assets. Instead, all of the debtor’s seizeable assets at the time
of the adjudication of the bankruptcy form the bankrupt estate. For creditors, the bankruptcy results,
among other things, in all the obligations of the debtor becoming due (except for obligations
secured by mortgages) and interest ceases to accrue against the debtor. Creditors have to file their
claims (i.e., principal, interest accrued until the date of bankruptcy, and costs of debt collection)
with the bankrupt estate. Unmatured non-interest bearing claims are discounted at five per cent per
annum. Contingent claims are admitted in their full amount, but the creditor is not entitled to receive
any payments before the condition is fulfilled. Moreover, subject to some limitations, a creditor may
set off his claims against a claim of the debtor against the creditor.

Until the so-called first meeting of creditors, the bankruptcy office (Konkursamt) acts as
administrator of the bankrupt estate. The first meeting of creditors, which is called by the
bankruptcy office, may, among other things, appoint an out-of-court administrator instead of the
bankruptcy office. The administrator has wide powers with regard to the administration of the
estate. Some material decisions require the approval of the creditors, however.

If there are no sufficient assets in the estate for an ordinary bankruptcy proceeding, the
bankruptcy court may order a summary procedure in which the creditors do not participate. Any
creditor may demand an ordinary proceeding, however, if he advances the costs of such a
proceeding. If there are no assets at all, the bankruptcy office may close a proceeding without
further ado for lack of assets.

_Ranking of Claims_

The ranking of creditors and the distribution of proceeds from the liquidation of the debtor’s
estate are governed by the following principles:

Secured claims are satisfied directly out of the proceeds of the collateral’s realization. The
costs for the administration (including realization) of the collateral will be deducted from these
proceeds.

   - Liabilities incurred by the trustee after the adjudication of bankruptcy, including the costs of
administration and of the bankruptcy proceeding have priority over unsecured claims and
will be satisfied at first.

   - Unsecured claims are ranked in three different classes. The claims of a higher class have to
be satisfied in full before claims of a lower class may be satisfied. Claims within the same
class are satisfied pro rata if not covered in full.

356


-----

The first class of claims comprises certain claims of employees, claims concerning accident
insurance, pension claims and claims of pension funds against employers. The second class
comprises social security premiums. All other claims fall into the third class. Generally, subordinated
claims formally belong to the third class but are treated as if they ranked in a fourth, fifth, etc. class,
depending on the extent of their subordination.

_Bankruptcy Proceedings Initiated by the Debtor_

A corporation may declare itself insolvent at any time by filing a petition with the bankruptcy
court. The court will then adjudicate bankruptcy, with the effects as outlined in the subsection
‘‘Bankruptcy proceedings’’ above.

Moreover, a corporation has to file for bankruptcy under some conditions based on
article 725(2) of the Swiss Code of Obligations. If at any time there is a substantiated concern that
the company may be overindebted, the board of directors has to prepare a standalone interim
balance sheet. If the equity of the company is negative both on a going concern basis and on a
liquidation basis, the board of directors has two alternatives. If there is a realistic chance of
success, the board of directors may explore the possibility of a financial reorganization during a few
weeks. The reorganization may take the form of a subordination of claims by creditors to the extent
that the assets do not cover such claims. If the reorganization attempt is futile or fails, the board of
directors has to notify the competent bankruptcy court. The bankruptcy court then may
(a) adjudicate the debtor bankrupt, (b) upon request by the board, initiate composition proceedings
or (c), upon request by the board or a creditor and if there is a prospect of financial restructuring,
postpone bankruptcy. In the latter case, the Bankruptcy Court may appoint a trustee.

_Moratorium and Composition Proceedings_

The Bankruptcy Act also provides for moratorium and composition proceedings. A debtor may
petition for a (provisional) moratorium with the competent composition court. The provisional
moratorium may be granted for four months, during which the debtor may restructure its debt and
reach an agreement with his creditors.

The effects of a moratorium on the position of the creditors are, among other things, that debt
collection, attachments and other remedies freezing assets will no longer be available to creditors,
that interest for unsecured claim ceases to accrue, that all litigation except for urgencies is stayed
and that, usually, the debtor may continue its business activities under the supervision of a trustee
appointed by the composition court. The court may also install a creditors’ committee which would
resolve on the disposal of assets; otherwise, such disposals require court approval.

If the restructuring is successful, the debtor may ask the court to lift the moratorium. If the
restructuring fails or is expected to fail, the moratorium is followed by composition proceedings,
which are actually a compulsory settlement, reached under official supervision and with court
confirmation. A composition requires the approval of a supermajority of the creditors and is also
binding on any dissenting or non-participating creditors. As a side note, any creditor entitled to
petition for the opening of bankruptcy proceedings may petition for composition proceedings as
well.

_Fraudulent Conveyances and Voidable Preference_

Under the Bankruptcy Act, the trustee in bankruptcy or an assignee may challenge specific
actions by the debtor as being fraudulent conveyances or voidable preference. The effect of a
successful challenge is that the relevant assets are recovered by the bankrupt estate for the benefit
of its creditors. As long as a transaction has not been challenged, it remains legally valid.

357


-----

There are basically two categories of fraudulent conveyances/voidable preferences. The first
category comprises transactions which were, in a broad sense, not at arm’s length and to the
detriment of the debtor, including the providing of security for unsecured obligations or the payment
of debt not yet due. With regard to intra-group transactions, the counterparty of the transaction has
to prove that the transaction was at arm’s length. These actions may be challenged if they have
been made within one year prior to the adjudication of bankruptcy. The second category comprises
all transactions within five years prior to the adjudication of bankruptcy which have been made with
the debtor’s intention to disadvantage his creditors or to grant a benefit to certain creditors to the
disadvantage of others, provided that the counterparty to the transaction knew or should have
known of such intent. In related party transactions, the counterparty bears the burden of proof that
it was not aware of such intent.

**_Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of Guarantees_**

As a matter of Swiss corporate law, the validity and enforceability of any security, guarantee,
joint and several liability, indemnity or other instrument or benefit (including through subordination
and by means of a waiver of set-off, subrogation or other rights) granted by a Swiss company for,
or with respect to, any obligation of any person other than such company’s direct or indirect
subsidiaries (collectively ‘‘Up- or Cross-Stream Benefits’’) is subject to and limited by:

(i) such company’s corporate objects purpose as stated in its articles of association
(Statuten);

(ii) the fiduciary duties of its board of directors, which require the directors, among other
things, (1) to act in the interest of the company as a stand-alone legal entity even if that
would not be in the interest of the group of companies to which the company belongs,
(2) to preserve a sufficient amount of liquidity regardless of the company’s disposable
equity and (3) to safeguard the interests of all creditors of the company, especially (but
not only) in the vicinity of insolvency;

(iii) the rules regarding capital maintenance, under which Up- or Cross-Stream Benefits may
be limited to the freely disposable equity capital of the company granting such benefits
at the relevant time. Such freely disposable equity capital is determined on the basis of a
stand- alone audited balance sheet of the relevant company in accordance with Swiss
law and

Swiss accounting principles and may be reduced by (1) an amount corresponding to the
value of such Up- or Cross-Stream Benefits, and (2) the aggregate amount of the loans,
if any, granted by such company to any affiliates or related parties other than its direct or
indirect subsidiaries, and (3) other adjustments. Further corporate actions (including
board resolutions and unanimous shareholders resolutions based on an audited balance
sheet) may need to be taken to effect the validity and enforceability of an Up- or CrossStream Benefit and/or to authorize the relevant payments, realizations or distributions
thereunder; and

(iv) defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally, including without limitation fraudulent
conveyance and voidable preference (summarized below in subsection ‘‘—Fraudulent
conveyance and voidable preference’’).

As a result of these restrictions, the liability of a guarantor incorporated under Swiss law under
its guarantee or the economic value of such guarantee could be reduced to zero.

358


-----

With regard to the guarantors incorporated under Swiss law, the indenture that will govern the
notes will provide substantially as follows:

‘‘The obligations of each guarantor which is incorporated under the laws of Switzerland (each
a ‘‘Swiss guarantor’’) are subject to the following limitations: If and to the extent the use of the
proceeds from the enforcement of the guarantee to discharge the obligations of the Issuer or any
other direct or indirect parent or sister companies of a Swiss guarantor (the ‘‘Swiss-Secured
Obligations’’) would constitute a repayment of capital (Einlager¨uckgew¨ahr/Kapitalr¨uckzahlung), a
violation of the legally protected reserves (gesetzlich gesch¨utzte Reserven) or the payment of a
(constructive) dividend (Gewinnaussch¨uttung) under Swiss corporate law, the proceeds from the
enforcement of the guarantee to be used to discharge the Swiss-Secured Obligations shall be
limited, to the extent required by applicable law at that time, to the maximum amount of the freely
disposable shareholders’ equity of each Swiss guarantor at the time of enforcement (the ‘‘Maximum
Amount’’); provided that such limitation shall not free the respective Swiss guarantor from its
obligations in excess of the Maximum Amount, but merely postpone the performance date of those
obligations until such time or times as performance is again permitted by then applicable law. The
Maximum Amount shall be determined in accordance with Swiss law and applicable Swiss
accounting principles and, if and to the extent required by applicable Swiss law, shall be confirmed
by the auditors of the respective Swiss guarantor on the basis of an interim audited balance sheet
as of that time. Each Swiss guarantor and each shareholder thereof shall promptly take or cause to
be taken, as applicable, all such measures necessary or useful to allow the respective Swiss
guarantor to use enforcement proceeds as agreed hereunder with a minimum of limitations’’.

**United States**

**_Certain Insolvency Considerations_**

The issuance of the notes and the guarantees may be subject to review under U.S. federal
and state fraudulent transfer and conveyance statutes if a bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization
case or a lawsuit, including under circumstances in which bankruptcy is not involved, were
commenced at some future date by the Issuer, by a guarantor or on behalf of the Issuer’s or a
guarantor’s unpaid creditors. While the relevant laws may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction in the
United States, the incurrence of the obligations in respect of the notes and the guarantees, will
generally be a fraudulent conveyance if (i) the transactions relating to the issuance of the notes or
guarantees were undertaken with the intent of hindering, delaying or defrauding creditors or (ii) the
Issuer or any of the guarantors, as applicable, received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair
consideration in return for issuing either the notes or a guarantee and, in the case of (ii) only, any
one of the following is also true:

   - the Issuer or such guarantor was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of issuing the
notes or the guarantees;

   - the issuance of the notes or guarantees left the Issuer or such guarantor with an
unreasonably small amount of capital to carry on the business in which the Issuer or such
guarantor was engaged or about to engage; or

   - the Issuer or such guarantor intended to, or believed that we or it would, incur debts
beyond our or its ability to pay as they become due.

If a U.S. court were to find that the issuance of the notes or a guarantee was a fraudulent
conveyance, the court could void the payment obligations under the notes or such guarantee or
further subordinate the notes or such guarantee to presently existing and future indebtedness of the
Issuer or such guarantor, or require the holders of the notes to repay any amounts received with
respect to the notes or such guarantee. In the event of a finding that a fraudulent conveyance

359


-----

occurred, you may not receive any repayment on the notes. Further, the voidance of the notes
could result in an event of default with respect to the Issuer’s other debt and that of the guarantors
that could result in acceleration of such debt.

The measures of insolvency for purposes of fraudulent conveyance laws vary depending upon
the law of the U.S. jurisdiction that is being applied, such that we cannot be certain as to: the
standards a court would use to determine whether or not the Issuer or the guarantors were solvent
at the relevant time, or, regardless of the standard that a court uses, that it would not determine that
the Issuer or a guarantor was indeed insolvent on that date; that any payments to the holders of
the notes (including under the guarantees) did not constitute preferences, fraudulent transfers or
conveyances on other grounds; or that the issuance of the notes and the guarantees would not be
subordinated to the Issuer’s or any guarantor’s other debt.

Generally, an entity would be considered insolvent if, at the time it incurred indebtedness:

   - the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the fair value of all its
assets;

   - the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required
to pay its probable liability on its existing debts and liabilities, including contingent liabilities,
as they become absolute and mature; or

   - it could not pay its debts as they become due.

As a general matter, value is given for a transfer or an obligation if, in exchange for the
transfer or obligation, property is transferred or a valid antecedent debt is satisfied. A U.S. court
would likely find that the Issuer or a guarantor did not receive reasonably equivalent value or fair
consideration for the notes or such guarantee if the Issuer or such guarantor did not substantially
benefit directly or indirectly from the issuance of the notes or the applicable guarantee. Thus, if the
guarantees were legally challenged, any guarantee could be subject to the claim that, since the
guarantee was incurred for the Issuer’s benefit, and only indirectly for the benefit of the guarantor,
the obligations of the applicable guarantor were incurred for less than reasonably equivalent value
or fair consideration. Therefore, a court could void the obligations under the guarantees,
subordinate them to the applicable guarantor’s other debt or take other action detrimental to the
holders of the notes.

To the extent a U.S. court avoids any of the guarantees as fraudulent transfers or holds any of
the guarantees unenforceable for any other reason, the holders of notes would cease to have any
direct claim against the applicable guarantor. If a U.S. court were to take this action, the applicable
guarantor’s assets would be applied first to satisfy the applicable guarantor’s other liabilities, if any,
and might not be applied to the payment of the guarantee. Sufficient funds to repay the notes may
not be available from other sources, including the remaining guarantors, if any. In addition, the
court might direct you to repay any amounts that you already received from the Issuer or the
applicable guarantor.

Although each guarantee entered into in connection with the notes will contain a provision
intended to limit that guarantor’s liability to the maximum amount that it could incur without causing
the incurrence of obligations under its guarantee to be a fraudulent transfer, this provision may not
be effective as a legal matter to protect those guarantees from being avoided under fraudulent
transfer law or otherwise, or may reduce that guarantor’s obligation to an amount that effectively
makes its guarantee worthless.

In addition, as noted above, any payment by the Issuer pursuant to the notes or by a
guarantor under a guarantee made at a time the Issuer or such guarantor was found to be
insolvent could be voided and required to be returned to the Issuer or such guarantor or to a fund

360


-----

for the benefit of the Issuer’s or such guarantor’s creditors if such payment is made to an insider
within a one-year period prior to a bankruptcy filing or within 90 days for any outside party and
such payment would give such insider or outsider party more than such creditors would have
received in a distribution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in a hypothetical Chapter 7 case.

Finally, as a court of equity, a U.S. bankruptcy court may otherwise subordinate the claims in
respect of the notes or the guarantees to other claims against the Issuer or the guarantors under
the principle of equitable subordination, if the court determines that: (i) the holder of the notes
engaged in some type of inequitable conduct; (ii) such inequitable conduct resulted in injury to our
other creditors or conferred an unfair advantage upon the holder of the notes; and (iii) equitable
subordination is not inconsistent with the provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.

_Any future guarantee may be avoidable in bankruptcy._

Guarantees issued after the issue date of the notes may be treated under bankruptcy law as if
they were delivered to guarantee previously existing indebtedness. Any future issuance of a
guarantee, including pursuant to guarantees delivered in connection therewith after the date the
notes are issued, may be avoidable by the guarantor (as a debtor in possession), by its trustee in
bankruptcy, or potentially by other creditors if certain events or circumstances exist or occur,
including, among others, if (1) the guarantor is insolvent at the time of the issuance of the
guarantee, (2) the issuance of the guarantee permits the holders of the notes to receive a greater
recovery in a hypothetical Chapter 7 case than if the guarantee had not been given and (3) a
bankruptcy proceeding in respect of the guarantor is commenced within 90 days following the
issuance of the guarantee, or, in certain circumstances, a longer period. Accordingly, if the Issuer or
any guarantor were to file for bankruptcy protection after the issue date of the notes and any
guarantees not issued on the issue date of the notes had been issued less than 90 days before
commencement of such bankruptcy proceeding, such guarantees are materially more likely to be
avoided as a preference by the bankruptcy court than if delivered on the issue date of the notes
(even if the other guarantees issued on the issue date of the notes would no longer be subject to
such risk). To the extent that the grant of any such guarantee is avoided as a preference or
otherwise, you would lose the benefit of that guarantee.

**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**

The Issuer and the initial purchasers named below (the ‘‘initial purchasers’’) have entered into
a purchase agreement with respect to the notes. Subject to certain conditions, each initial
purchaser has severally agreed to purchase the respective principal amount of notes indicated
opposite its name as set forth in the following table.

The initial purchasers have agreed to purchase all of the notes being sold pursuant to the
purchase agreement if any of the notes are purchased. If an initial purchaser defaults, the purchase
commitment of the non-defaulting initial purchasers may be increased in certain circumstances or
the purchase agreement may be terminated.

The initial purchasers have advised us that they propose initially to offer the notes at the price
listed on the cover page of this offering circular. After the initial offering of the notes, the initial
purchasers may from time to time vary the offering price and selling terms. The initial purchasers
may offer and sell through certain of their affiliates.

The Issuer has agreed to indemnify the initial purchasers against certain liabilities, including
liabilities under the Securities Act, or to contribute to payments the initial purchasers may be
required to make in respect of those liabilities.

The initial purchasers are offering the notes, subject to prior sale, if, as and when issued to
and accepted by them, subject to approval of legal matters by their counsel, including the validity
of the notes, and other conditions contained in the purchase agreement, such as the receipt by the
initial purchasers of officers’ certificates and legal opinions. The initial purchasers reserve the right
to withdraw, cancel or modify offers to investors and to reject orders in whole or in part.

The notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act and may not be
offered or sold within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons, except
to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under
the Securities Act and to persons in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S under the
Securities Act. In connection with sales outside the United States, the initial purchasers have agreed
that they will not offer, sell or deliver the notes to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons
(i) as part of the initial purchasers’ distribution at any time or (ii) otherwise until 40 days after the
later of the commencement of the offering or the date the notes are originally issued. Each initial
purchaser will send to each dealer to whom it sells such notes during such 40-day period a
confirmation or other notice setting forth the restrictions on offers and sales of the notes within the
United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons, except in reliance on Rule 144A.
With respect to jurisdictions located outside of the United States, the offers will be conducted
through affiliates of the initial purchasers that are registered and/or licensed to conduct the offers in

362


-----

such jurisdictions. Terms used in this paragraph have the meanings given to them under the
Securities Act. Resales of the notes are restricted as described under ‘‘Transfer Restrictions’’.

The Issuer has agreed that for a period of 75 days after the date of the purchase agreement,
neither the Issuer nor any of the guarantors will, other than as contemplated by the purchase
agreement, without the prior written consent of Goldman Sachs International, directly or indirectly,
offer, sell, contract to sell, or otherwise transfer or dispose of (or enter into any transaction or devise
that is designed to, or could be reasonably expected to, result in the disposition in the future of)
any debt securities issued or guaranteed by the Issuer or any of the guarantors other than those
contemplated by the Transactions.

In addition, with respect to notes initially sold pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities
Act, until 40 days after the commencement of this offering, an offer or sale of such notes within the
U.S. by a dealer that is not participating in the offering may violate the registration requirements of
the Securities Act.

There is no established trading market for the notes. Although an application has been made
by or on behalf of the Issuer to the Authority for the listing of and permission to deal in the notes
on the Official List of the Exchange, there is no assurance that the notes will be listed on the Official
List of the Exchange, that such permission to deal in the notes will be granted or that such listing
will be maintained. The notes will be a new issue of securities for which there is no established
trading market. The initial purchasers have advised us that they presently intend to make a market
in the notes as permitted by applicable laws; however, they are not obligated to do so and may
discontinue such market making at any time without providing any notice. Accordingly, no
assurance can be given as to the liquidity of any trading market for the notes.

In connection with the offering, the initial purchasers may purchase and sell notes and/or our
other debt securities in the open market. These transactions may include short sales, stabilizing
transactions and purchases to cover positions created by short sales. Short sales involve the sale
by the initial purchasers of a greater number of notes (or such other securities) than they are
required to purchase in the offering or which they hold in inventory. Stabilizing transactions consist
of certain bids or purchases made for the purpose of preventing or retarding a decline in the
market price of the notes while the offering is in progress.

The initial purchasers also may impose a penalty bid. This occurs when a particular initial
purchaser repays to the other initial purchasers a portion of the commission received by it because
an initial purchaser or its affiliates have repurchased notes sold by or for the account of such initial
purchaser in stabilizing or short covering transactions.

These activities by the initial purchasers, as well as other purchases by the initial purchasers
for their own accounts, may stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the market price of the notes
and/or our other debt securities. As a result, the price of the notes (or such other securities) may
be higher than the price that otherwise might exist in the open market. If these activities are
commenced, they may be discontinued by the initial purchasers at any time. These transactions
may be effected in the over-the-counter market or otherwise.

The initial purchasers and certain of their affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged
in various activities, which may include sales and trading, commercial and investment banking,
financial advisory, investment management, investment research, principal investment, hedging,
market making, brokerage and other financial and non-financial activities and services. Certain of
the initial purchasers and their respective affiliates have, from time to time, performed, and may in
the future perform, various financial advisory and investment banking services for the Issuer, for
which they received or will receive customary fees and expenses. Affiliates of Barclays Bank PLC
and RBC Europe Limited are serving as financial advisors to Bain Capital in connection with the

363


-----

Transactions. Each of the initial purchasers and/or their affiliates is acting as an arranger, agent
and/or lender under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. In connection with the Transactions, we
entered into a commitment letter with each of the initial purchasers and/or certain of their respective
affiliates providing, in part, for a $600.0 million senior unsecured bridge facility (the ‘‘Bridge
Facility’’) and in connection therewith, such initial purchasers or affiliates will receive customary
fees. The commitments under the Bridge Facility will be reduced dollar-for-dollar, down to $0, by the
gross proceeds from this offering, and the related commitment will be terminated. Certain of the
initial purchasers or their affiliates that have a lending relationship with us routinely hedge their
credit exposure to us consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, such
initial purchasers and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which
consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in our
securities, including potentially the notes offered hereby. Any such credit default swaps or short
positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the notes offered hereby.

The initial purchasers will receive customary commissions and discounts under the purchase
agreement upon the consummation of the offering of the notes pursuant to this offering circular.

In the ordinary course of their various business activities, the initial purchasers and certain of
their respective affiliates, officers, directors and employees may purchase, sell, make or hold a
broad array of investments and actively trade securities, derivatives, loans, commodities, currencies,
credit default swaps and other financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account
and for the accounts of their customers, and such investment and securities activities may involve
securities and/or instruments of the Issuer. The initial purchasers and certain of their affiliates may
also make investment recommendations and/or publish or express independent research views in
respect of such securities or instruments and may at any time hold, or recommend to clients that
they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments.

The initial purchasers may hold a portion of the notes after the consummation of the offering.

to any of the notes in any Relevant Member State means the communication in any form and by
any means of sufficient information on the terms of the offer and the notes to be offered so as to
enable an investor to decide to purchase or subscribe for the notes, as the same may be varied in
that Relevant Member State by any measure implementing the Prospectus Directive in that Relevant
Member State, and the expression ‘‘Prospectus Directive’’ means Directive 2003/71/EC (as

**ENFORCEABILITY OF JUDGMENTS**

The Issuer is incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands, and certain of the guarantors
are organized under the laws of various jurisdictions outside the United States, including Australia,
Austria, Brazil, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Mexico, the Netherlands,
Poland, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom (such guarantors, the ‘‘non-U.S.
guarantors’’). Certain of the Issuer’s and the non-U.S. guarantors’ directors and officers reside
outside the United States, and all or a significant portion of such directors’ and officers’ assets, and
a significant portion of the Issuer’s and the non-U.S. guarantors’ assets, are located outside the
United States. As a result, to effect service of process within the United States upon the Issuer or
the non-U.S. guarantors with respect to matters arising under the U.S. federal securities laws or to
enforce against the Issuer or the non-U.S. guarantors judgments obtained in U.S. courts, including
judgments predicated upon civil liability under U.S. federal securities laws, we have agreed, in
accordance with the terms of the indenture under which the notes will be issued, to accept service
of process in any suit, action or proceeding with respect to such indenture or the notes brought in
any federal or state court located in the Borough of Manhattan, in the City of New York, by an
agent designated for such purpose, and to submit to the jurisdiction of such courts in connection
with such suits, actions or proceedings. However, it may be difficult for holders of the notes to
realize in the United States upon judgments of courts of the United States predicated upon civil
liability under U.S. federal or state securities laws or other laws of the United States.

If a judgment is obtained in a U.S. court against the Issuer or a non-U.S. guarantor or any of
their directors or executive officers, investors will need to enforce such judgment in jurisdictions
where the relevant defendant has assets. Even though the enforceability of U.S. court judgments
outside the United States is described below for the Netherlands, Australia, Austria, Canada,
England and Wales, Mexico, Poland, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland, you should consult with your
own advisors in any pertinent jurisdictions as needed to enforce a judgment in those countries or
elsewhere outside the United States.

**The Netherlands**

The United States and the Netherlands currently do not have a treaty providing for the
reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitration awards, in civil and
commercial matters. Consequently, a final judgment for payment given by any court in the United
States, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. securities laws, would not be enforceable in the
Netherlands. In order to obtain a judgment which is enforceable in the Netherlands, the claim must
be re-litigated before a competent Dutch court. Based on case law, the courts of the Netherlands
may be expected to give conclusive effect to a final and enforceable judgment of such court of
competent jurisdiction in the U.S. without re-examination or re-litigation of the substantive matters
adjudicated thereby, provided that (i) the relevant United States court accepted jurisdiction in the
matter on the basis of an internationally recognized ground to accept jurisdiction, (ii) the
proceedings before such court complied with principles of proper procedure (behoorlijke
_rechtspleging), (iii) such judgment does not conflict with the public policy of the Netherlands, and_
(iv) such judgment is not incompatible with a judgment given between the same parties by a
Netherlands court or with a prior judgment given between the same parties by a foreign court in a
dispute concerning the same subject matter and based on the same cause of action, provided
such prior judgment is recognizable in the Netherlands. Subject to the foregoing and provided that
service of process occurs in accordance with applicable treaties, investors may be able to enforce
in the Netherlands judgments in civil and commercial matters obtained from U.S. federal or state
courts. However, no assurance can be given that such judgments will be enforceable. In addition, it
is doubtful whether a Dutch court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability in an original
action commenced in the Netherlands and predicated solely upon U.S. securities laws.

372


-----

**Australia**

The United States and Australia do not have a treaty which provides for the reciprocal
recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil matters. Further, United States courts are not
listed in the Foreign Judgments Regulations 1992 made under the Foreign Judgments Act 1991 of
Australia Therefore, there is no statutory recognition or statutory enforcement in Australia of any
judgment obtained in a court in the United States. Instead, a judgment made by a U.S. court can
only be enforced in Australia under the common law regime.

Under that regime, any final, conclusive and unsatisfied judgment in personam (that is, that
imposes a personal obligation on the defendant) of a U.S. court which has jurisdiction as
determined under the rules of private international law of Australia, and is for a definite sum of
money (not being a sum in respect of taxes or other charges of a like nature or in respect of a fine
or other penalty), and is between the same parties, may be enforceable by the judgment creditor
against the judgment debtor by action in the Australian courts (without re-examination of the merits
of the issues determined by the proceedings in the U.S. court) unless certain circumstances apply,
including:

   - the judgement debtor (or its duly appointed agent) did not receive notice of the proceedings
in sufficient time to contest the proceedings;

   - the U.S. judgment was obtained by fraud or has been reversed or set aside or its
enforcement would be contrary to public policy in Australia;

   - the courts of Australia had no jurisdiction in the circumstances of the case resulting in the
U.S. judgment; or

   - the matter determined by the judgment was the subject of an earlier final and conclusive
judgment by another court having jurisdiction.

The Australian dollar is convertible into U.S. dollars at freely floating rates, subject to the
sanctions described below. The Autonomous Sanctions Regulations 2011 promulgated under the
Autonomous Sanctions Act 2011 of Australia, the Charter of the United Nations Act 1945 of
Australia, and other laws and regulations in Australia restrict or prohibit payments, transactions and
dealings with assets having a prescribed connection with certain countries or named individuals or
entities subject to international sanctions or associated with terrorism or money laundering.

The Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade maintains a list of all persons and
entities having a prescribed connection with terrorism and a list of all persons and entities that are
subject to autonomous sanctions (which include economic sanctions) which are available to the
public at the department’s website at http://www.dfat.gov.au/icat/UNSC_financial_sanctions.html.

**Austria**

The United States and Austria do not currently have a treaty providing for reciprocal
recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters, other than arbitration
awards in civil and commercial matters. Therefore, a final judgment for payment of money rendered
by a federal or state court in the United States based on civil liability, whether or not predicated
solely upon U.S. federal securities laws, will not be recognized and enforceable, either in whole or
in part, in Austria. However, if the party in whose favor such final judgment is rendered brings a
new suit in a competent court in Austria, such party may submit to the Austrian court the final
judgment rendered in the United States. Under such circumstances, a judgment by a federal or
state court of the United States against the Issuer or a guarantor will be regarded by an Austrian
court only as evidence of the outcome of the dispute to which such judgment relates, and an

373


-----

Austrian court may choose to re-hear the dispute. In addition, awards of punitive damages in
actions brought in the United States or elsewhere are unenforceable in Austria.

**Canada**

There is some doubt as to the enforceability in Canada in original actions, or in actions for
enforcement of judgments of U.S. courts, of civil liabilities predicated upon U.S. federal securities
laws. The courts of Canada may not: (a) enforce judgments of U.S. courts obtained in actions
against such persons predicated upon civil liabilities under the federal securities laws of the United
States or ‘‘blue sky’’ laws of any state within the U.S.; or (b) enforce, in original actions, liabilities
against such persons predicated upon civil liabilities under the federal securities laws of the U.S. or
‘‘blue sky’’ laws of any state within the U.S.

**Denmark**

We have been advised by our Danish legal counsel that there is no treaty on the reciprocal
recognition and enforcement of judgments (other than arbitration awards) in civil and commercial
matters between the United States and Denmark. Courts in Denmark will not automatically
recognize and enforce a final judgment rendered by a U.S. court. Under Danish law, a Danish title
for execution (i.e., a Danish court judgment) is required for such recognition and enforcement; in
seeking a Danish court judgment or order to such effect, a judgment of a U.S. court may constitute
circumstantial evidence of the questions of fact in the case concerned and evidence of the
governing law as applied to the matter in dispute. The application by a Danish court of foreign law
in a matter brought before it is subject to (a) the foreign law not being contrary to such mandatory
rules of Danish law that due to their public nature or general interest would be considered
applicable irrespective of the agreed choice of law and (b) the application of the foreign law not
resulting in an outcome contrary to the public policy (ordre public) of the Danish legal system.

**England and Wales**

The United States and England and Wales currently do not have a treaty between them
providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments (as opposed to arbitration
awards) in civil and commercial matters. Consequently, a final judgment for payment rendered by
any federal or state court in the United States based on civil liability, whether or not predicated
solely upon U.S. federal securities laws, would not automatically be recognized or enforceable in
England and Wales. In order to enforce any such U.S. judgment in England and Wales, fresh
proceedings must first be initiated before a court of competent jurisdiction in England and Wales. In
such an action, an English court would not generally reinvestigate the merits of the original matter
decided by the U.S. court (subject to what is said below) and it would usually be possible to obtain
summary judgment on such a claim (assuming that there is no good defense to it). Summary
judgment is a procedure by which the English court can dispose of all or part of a claim without
proceeding to a full trial. Recognition and enforcement of a U.S. judgment by an English court in
such an action may be conditional upon (among other things) the following:

   - the U.S. court having had jurisdiction over the original proceedings according to English
conflicts of laws principles and rules of English private international law (in other words, it
does not matter that the U.S. court had jurisdiction according to its own law, but instead
whether it had jurisdiction according to the rules of English private international law);

   - the U.S. judgment not having been given in breach of a jurisdiction or arbitration clause;

   - the U.S. judgment being final and conclusive on the merits in the sense of being final and
unalterable in the court which pronounced it and being for a debt for a definite sum of
money;

374


-----

   - the U.S. judgment not contravening English public policy, the European Convention on
Human Rights or the Human Rights Act 1998 (or any subordinate legislation made
thereunder, to the extent applicable);

   - the U.S. judgment not being for a sum payable in respect of taxes, or other charges of a
like nature, or in respect of a penalty or fine, or otherwise involving the enforcement of a
non-English penal or revenue law;

   - the U.S. judgment not having been arrived at by doubling, trebling or otherwise multiplying
a sum assessed as compensation for the loss or damages sustained and not being
otherwise in breach of the Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980;

   - the U.S. judgment not having been obtained by fraud or in breach of English principles of
natural justice;

   - there not having been a prior inconsistent, determinative or conflicting judgment of an
English or other non-U.S. court in respect of the same matter involving the same parties
and/or prior inconsistent judgment given in a Hague Convention Member State of the
European Union or a Member State of the European Economic Area which the English
Court must recognize and enforce under the Hague Convention Choice of Court
Agreements of June 30, 2005 and/or Council Regulation (EC) 1215/2012 and/or the Lugano
Conventions of 1988 and 2007;

   - the U.S. judgment not having been wholly satisfied or not being enforceable by execution in
the U.S.;

   - the party seeking enforcement providing security for costs, if ordered to do so by the
English court; and

   - the English enforcement proceedings being commenced within six years from the date of
the U.S. judgment.

Subject to the foregoing, investors may be able to enforce judgments in England and Wales in
civil and commercial matters that have been obtained from U.S. federal or state courts. However,
we cannot assure you that those judgments will be recognized or enforceable in England and
Wales. In addition, it is questionable whether an English court would accept jurisdiction and impose
civil liability if proceedings were commenced in England and Wales, instead of the United States, in
an original action predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws. Further, it may not be possible
to obtain a judgment in England and Wales or to enforce the judgment if the judgment debtor is
subject to any insolvency or similar proceedings, or if the judgment debtor has any setoff or
counterclaim against the judgment creditor. Finally, note that, in any enforcement proceedings, the
judgment debtor may raise any counterclaim that could have been brought if the action had been
originally brought in England and Wales unless the subject of the counterclaim was in issue and
denied in the U.S. proceedings.

**France**

Any final and conclusive judgment obtained in the U.S. will be recognized and enforced in
France, after due service of process, if: (a) the U.S. court had indirect jurisdiction based on the
connection of the dispute to such U.S. court, (b) such judgment is in conformity with the French
public international order with respect to its merits and procedure (ordre public international de fond
_et de proc´edure), and (c) such judgment is not tainted with fraud. This condition of regularity of_
international foreign judgments is traditionally required by case law. Recently, the French Supreme
Court (Cour de Cassation) has judged that, if punitive damages are not, per se, contradictory to the
French public international order on the merits and procedure (ordre public international de fond et

375


-----

_de proc´edure), such punitive damages are challengeable when their amounts are disproportionate_
with regard to the judgment and breach of the contractual commitments of the debtor and related
damages so suffered.

**Germany**

We have been advised by our German counsel that there is doubt as to the enforceability in
Germany of civil liabilities based on U.S. federal or state securities laws, either in an original action
or in an action to enforce a judgment obtained in U.S. federal or state courts. The United States
and Germany currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and
enforcement of judgments, other than arbitration awards, in civil and commercial matters.
Consequently, a final judgment by any U.S. federal or state court for payment, whether or not
predicated solely upon U.S. federal or state securities laws, would not automatically be enforceable
in Germany. A final judgment by a U.S. federal or state court, however, may be recognized and
enforced in Germany in an action before a court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with the
proceedings set forth by the German Code of Civil Procedure (Zivilprozessordnung). In such an
action, a German court generally would not reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided
by a U.S. court, except as noted below. The recognition and enforcement of a U.S. judgment by a
German court would be conditional upon a number of factors, including the following:

   - the judgment being final under U.S. federal or state law;

   - the U.S. court having had jurisdiction over the original proceeding under German law;

   - the document introducing the proceedings was duly served and made known to the
defendant in a timely manner that allowed for adequate defense and the defendant having
had the chance to defend herself or himself against an unduly or untimely served complaint;

   - the judgment of the U.S. court being consistent with the judgment of a German court or a
recognized judgment of a foreign court handed down before the judgment of the U.S. court;

   - the matter (Vefahren) resulting in the judgment of the U.S. court being consistent with the
matter (Verfahren) pending before a German court, provided that such German matter was
pending before a German court prior to the U.S. court entered its judgment;

   - the enforcement of the judgment by the U.S. court being compatible with the substantial
foundations of German law (ordre public), in particular with the civil liberties (Grundrechte)
guaranteed by virtue of the German Constitution (Grundgesetz); and

   - generally, the guarantee of reciprocity.

Enforcement and foreclosure based on U.S. judgments may be sought against German
defendants after having received an exequatur decision from a competent German court in
accordance with the above principles. Subject to the foregoing, a person who has obtained a
judgment from U.S. federal or state courts may be able to enforce judgments in Germany in civil
and commercial matters. However, we cannot assure you that those judgments will be enforceable.
Even if a U.S. judgment is recognized in Germany, it does not necessarily mean that it will be
enforced in all circumstances. In particular, the obligations need to be of a specific kind and type
for which an enforcement procedure exists under German law. Also, if circumstances have arisen
after the date on which such foreign judgment became res judicata, a defense against execution
may arise. It is doubtful whether a German court would impose civil liability if proceedings were
commenced in Germany based solely upon U.S. federal or state securities laws.

German courts usually deny the recognition and enforcement of punitive damages (which do
not serve a compensatory purpose) as they are regarded to be in conflict with fundamental
principles of German law. Moreover, a German court may reduce the amount of damages granted

376


-----

by a U.S. court and recognize damages only to the extent that they are necessary to compensate
actual losses or damages. Enforcement is also subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, liquidation, moratorium, general principles of good faith (Treu und
Glauben), clawback (Anfechtung) as well as other similar laws affecting creditors’ rights generally. In
addition, it is doubtful whether a German court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability in
an original action predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws.

German civil procedure differs substantially from U.S. civil procedure in a number of respects.
With respect to the production of evidence, for example, U.S. federal and state law and the laws of
several other jurisdictions based on common law provide for pre-trial discovery, a process by which
parties to the proceedings may, prior to trial, compel the production of documents by adverse or
third parties and the deposition of witnesses. Evidence obtained in this manner may be decisive in
the outcome of any proceeding. No such pre-trial discovery process exists under German law.

Enforcement is also subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, liquidation or moratorium as well as other similar laws affecting creditors’ rights
generally.

If the party in whose favor such final judgment is rendered brings a new lawsuit in a
competent court in Germany, such party may submit to the German court the final judgment
rendered in the United States. Under such circumstances, a judgment by a federal or U.S. state
court will be regarded by a German court only as evidence of the outcome of the dispute to which
such judgment relates. A German court may choose to re-hear the dispute and may render a
judgment not in line with the judgment rendered by a federal or U.S. state court.

**Mexico**

Under Mexican law, a judgment rendered by a foreign court pursuant to a legal action
instituted before such court in connection with the provisions of the notes or the guarantees
granted by the Mexican guarantors would be enforceable in a competent court of Mexico if
complying with Article 1347A of the Commerce Code (C´odigo de Comercio) and other applicable
provisions of the Mexican Federal Code of Civil Proceedings (C´odigo Federal de Procedimientos
_Civiles), which provides, inter alia, that any judgment rendered outside Mexico may be enforced by_
Mexican courts, provided that:

(a) such judgment is obtained in compliance with the legal requirements of the jurisdiction of
the court rendering such judgment and in compliance with all legal requirements of the
relevant document;

(b) such judgment is strictly for the payment of a certain sum of money, based on an in
_personam (as opposed to an in rem) action;_

(c) the judge or court rendering the judgment was competent to hear and judge on the
subject matter of the case in accordance with accepted principles of international law
that are compatible with Mexican law;

(d) service of process is made personally on the defendant;

(e) such judgment does not contravene Mexican law, public policy of Mexico, international
treaties or agreements binding upon Mexico or generally accepted principles of
international law;

(f) the applicable procedure under the laws of Mexico with respect to the enforcement of
foreign judgments (including the issuance of a letter rogatory by the competent authority
of such jurisdiction requesting enforcement of such judgment and the certification of

377


-----

such judgment as authentic by the corresponding authorities of such jurisdiction in
accordance with the laws thereof) is complied with;

(g) the action in respect of which such judgment is rendered is not the subject matter of a
lawsuit among the same parties pending before a Mexican court;

(h) such judgment is final, non-appealable and conclusive (cosa juzgada) in the jurisdiction
where obtained; and

(i) the courts of such jurisdiction recognize the principles of reciprocity in connection with
the enforcement of Mexican judgments in such jurisdiction.

**Poland**

The following discussion with respect to the enforceability of certain U.S. court judgments in
Poland is based upon advice provided to us by Polish legal advisors.

In Poland, the enforceability of judgments of foreign courts subject to enforcement (which
generally represent judgments for the payment of money or specific performance) may be applied
for: (i) under the provisions of respective EU laws if the judgment was issued in a Member State,
(ii) under international agreements, if a relevant bilateral/multilateral treaty provides for such
enforcement, or (iii) on the basis of the rules of the Polish Code of Civil Procedure if (i) or (ii) above
does not apply. There is currently no treaty between the United States and Poland providing for the
reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments (other than arbitration awards) rendered in
civil and commercial matters. Therefore, in such case the rules of the Polish Code of Civil
Procedure apply. Under that procedure, any final and conclusive judgment against a guarantor with
its registered office in Poland obtained in a court of the United States and arising out of or in
relation to the obligations of the guarantor under the guarantee, would be recognized ex lege in
Poland, unless:

   - the judgment is not final and binding in the U.S.,

   - the judgment was issued on an issue which is within the exclusive jurisdiction of Polish
courts (such as matters relating to real property located in Poland),

   - the defendant who has not entered the dispute as to the essence of the disputed issue has
not been served the complaint in the manner enabling the defendant to defend himself,

   - a party was deprived of the ability to defend itself in the course of the proceeding,

   - proceedings related to the same claim between the same parties had been commenced in
Poland before it was initiated in the U.S. court,

   - the judgment is contrary to a previously issued final and binding judgment of a Polish court
or of a foreign court judgment fulfilling the prerequisites for its recognition in Poland and
was issued in proceedings related to the same claim between the same parties, or

   - the recognition of the judgment would be contrary to the fundamental principles of legal
order of Poland.

Enforceability of any final and conclusive judgment against a guarantor with its registered
office in Poland obtained in a court of the United States and arising out of or in relation to the
obligations of the guarantor under the guarantee further requires that a Polish court issues a
decision confirming that given judgment of the U.S. court is enforceable (which decision will be
issued provided that given judgment is enforceable in the U.S. and all the conditions referred to
under sections (i) through to (vii) above are met). Any person who has a so-called legal interest
may apply to a Polish court with a motion proceeding for such decision.

378


-----

Once the motion to declare enforceability is considered and approved, the court issues a
decision to grant an enforceability clause. Enforcement pursuant to such decision may be initiated
as soon as the decision granting the enforceability clause becomes final and binding.

Finally, it should be noted that the enforcement actions conducted by the court executive
officer may be challenged and, therefore, the enforcement of obligations sometimes may not be
successful or may be lengthy, even if the U.S. judgment is recognized and enforceable in Poland.

**Spain**

Any judgment obtained in the United States would be recognized in Spain following the
provisions of Spanish Law 29/2015, of July 30, 2015 on International Legal Cooperation on Civil
Matters (Ley 29/2015, de 30 de julio, de cooperaci´on jur´ıdica internacional en materia civil) (the
‘‘ILC Act’’) observing in the first place EU law and any applicable treaty, secondly any special
Spanish law applicable to the matter and, finally, Articles 41 to 55 of ILC Act, in connection with
Article 523.2 of the Law of Civil Procedure dated January 7, 2000 (Ley de Enjuiciamiento Civil de 7
_de enero de 2000) (the ‘‘Spanish Law on Civil Procedure’’). Foreign judgments will be recognized_
and enforced in the absence of any applicable treaty (currently there is no such treaty between the
United States and Spain) provided that a request is filed meeting some formal requirements
established in Article 54.4 of the ILC Act (basically, that the judgment must be final, translated into
Spanish and apostilled), and finally none of the circumstances set forth in article 46 of the ILC Act
concur in them:

   - that the judgment is contrary to Spanish public policy (‘‘orden p´ublico’’);

   - that the judgment has been rendered by clearly breaching the rights of defense of any of
the parties and, in particular, if the judgment has been rendered by default of the defendant
(‘‘en rebeld´ıa’’) it would be deemed to breach his rights of defense if the defendant was not
regularly and timely notified to enable him to defend himself properly;

   - that the subject matter in respect of which the judgment has been rendered falls within the
exclusive jurisdiction of the Spanish courts or, in any other matters, if the foreign court
jurisdiction does not have a reasonable connection with the dispute;

   - that the foreign judgment is incompatible with another Spanish judgment;

   - that the foreign judgment is incompatible with another country’s judgment which meets the
requirements to be enforceable in Spain; or

   - that there is an on-going proceeding between the same parties and dealing with the same
subject which was opened before a Spanish court prior to the opening of the proceedings
before the foreign court.

According to Article 3.2 of the ILC Act the Spanish government may deny cooperation with
another state’s authorities if there has been a repeated refusal of cooperation or a legal prohibition
of providing cooperation by such other state’s authorities provided that the Spanish government
passes a Royal Decree for these purposes.

In addition, the discovery process under actions filed in the United States could be adversely
affected under certain circumstances by Spanish law (relating to communication of documents and
information of an economic, commercial, industrial, financial or technical nature to foreign
authorities or persons), which could prohibit or restrict obtaining evidence in Spain or from Spanish
persons in connection with a judicial or administrative U.S. action. Spanish courts may express any
such order in a currency other than euro in respect of the amount due and payable by the Issuer or
a guarantor, but in case of enforcement in Spain, the court costs and interest will be paid in euros.
Any judgment obtained against the Issuer or any of the guarantors in any country bound by the

379


-----

provisions of EU Regulation 1215/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council would be
recognized and enforced in accordance with the terms set forth thereby.

Pursuant to Article 54 of the current Spanish Law on Civil Procedure the parties to an
agreement are entitled to clearly agree to the submittal to one judge (juzgado) or court (tribunal)
(provided that under the Spanish Law on Civil Procedure and the Spanish Judicial Law (Ley 6/1985,
_de 1 de Julio, Org´anica del Poder Judicial) the relevant judge or court is competent to solve the_
corresponding dispute); therefore such article does not cover the validity of non-exclusive
jurisdiction clauses, at least for conflicts between different Spanish courts.

**Sweden**

We have been advised by Swedish counsel that enforceability of a judgment rendered by a
foreign court in civil and commercial matters is generally considered conditional upon that
enforceability of such judgment being expressly provided for under Swedish law or upon a treaty
providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments. The United States and
Sweden do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments
in civil and commercial matters (although the United States and Sweden are both parties to the
New York Convention on Arbitral Awards). This means that a judgment rendered by any federal or
state court in the United States based on civil liability would not be directly enforceable in Sweden.

In order to enforce any such judgment in Sweden, proceedings must therefore be initiated by
way of civil law action on the judgment debt before a court of competent jurisdiction in Sweden, or
an administrative tribunal or executive or other public authority of Sweden. In such an action, a
judgment rendered by any federal or state court in the United States may be regarded as evidence
in respect of, for example, factual circumstances or the content of U.S. law.

Pursuant to the provisions of the Regulation (EU) No.1215/2012 of the European Parliament
and of the Council of 12 December 2012, on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of
judgments in civil and commercial matters (the ‘‘Brussels Regulation’’), a judgment entered against
a company incorporated in Sweden (a ‘‘Swedish Party’’) in the courts of a Member State (as
defined therein, i.e. all member states of the European Union) and which is enforceable in such a
Member State, will be directly enforceable in Sweden upon the satisfaction of the formal
requirements of the Brussels Regulation without any declaration of enforceability being required. It
should be noted, however, that a party may apply for refusal of recognition or refusal of
enforcement, as applicable, in accordance with the Brussels Regulation. Such an application shall
be submitted to the relevant district court (Sw. tingsr¨att). Pursuant to the Brussels Regulation, if a
judgment contains a measure or an order which is not known under the laws of the Member State
in which the recognition of the judgment is invoked or in which the enforcement of the judgment,
the court settlement or the authentic instrument is sought, that measure or order shall, to the extent
possible, be adapted to a measure or order known under the laws of that Member State which has
equivalent effects attached to it and which pursues similar aims and interests.

Pursuant to the provisions of the 2007 Lugano Convention on the Recognition of Judgments
in Civil and Commercial Matters (the ‘‘Lugano Convention’’), a judgment entered against a Swedish
Party in the courts of a Contracting Party (as defined in the Lugano Convention) and which is
enforceable in such a Contracting Party, will, provided that a motion for enforcement has been filed
and granted with the relevant district court, be enforceable in Sweden if it meets the formal
requirements under the Lugano Convention.

A judgment entered against a Swedish Party in the courts of a state which is not, under the
terms of the Brussels Regulation or the Lugano Convention, a Member State (as defined in the
Brussels Regulation) or a Contracting Party (as defined in the Lugano Convention) would not be
recognized or enforceable in Sweden as a matter of law without retrial on its merits. Therefore, a

final judgment for payment of money rendered by the courts of such state would not be directly
enforceable, either in whole or in part, in Sweden. In order to enforce any such judgment in
Sweden, proceedings must therefore be initiated by way of civil law action on the judgment debt
before a court of competent jurisdiction in Sweden, or an administrative tribunal or executive or
other public authority of Sweden. In such an action, a judgment rendered by the courts of such
state may be regarded as evidence of, for example, factual circumstances or the content of the
relevant foreign law, but the competent Swedish authority may also choose to rehear the dispute ab
_initio._

**Switzerland**

There is doubt as to the enforceability of U.S. judgments in Switzerland, or the applicability of
U.S. federal or state securities laws in an action brought before a Swiss court. The United States
and Switzerland currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and
enforcement of judgments, other than arbitration awards, in civil and commercial matters.
Consequently, a final judgment by any U.S. federal or state court for payment, whether or not
predicated solely upon U.S. federal or state securities laws, would not automatically be enforceable
in Switzerland. A final judgment by a U.S. federal or state court, however, may be recognized in
Switzerland in an action before a court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with the proceeding
set forth by the Swiss Federal Act on International Private Law (Bundesgesetz ¨uber das
_internationale Privatrecht) and the Swiss Federal Act on Civil Procedure (Schweizerische_
_Zivilprozessordnung). In such an action, a Swiss court generally would not reinvestigate the merits_
of the original matter decided by a U.S. court. The recognition and enforcement of a U.S. judgment
by a Swiss court would be conditional upon a number of conditions including those set out in
articles 25 et seq. of the Swiss Federal Act on International Private Law (Bundesgesetz ¨uber das
_internationale Privatrecht), which include:_

   - the U.S. court having had jurisdiction over the original proceedings from a Swiss
perspective;

   - the judgment being final under U.S. federal or state law, no ordinary legal remedy being
available against such judgment;

   - the defendant having had the chance to defend herself or himself against any unduly or
untimely served complaint except for a defendant having unconditionally consented to the
original proceeding before the respective court;

   - the original proceeding not having been conducted under a violation of material principles
of Swiss civil proceedings law, in particular the right to be heard;

   - the matter (Verfahren) resulting in the judgment of the U.S. court not being consistent with
the matter (Verfahren) pending before a Swiss court, provided such Swiss matter was
pending before a Swiss court prior to the U.S. court entered its proceedings; and

   - the enforcement of the judgment by the U.S. court not being manifestly incompatible with
Swiss public policy (schweizerischer Ordre public).

Subject to the foregoing, purchasers of the notes may be able to enforce judgments in civil
and commercial matters obtained from U.S. federal or state courts in Switzerland. We cannot,
however, assure you that any attempts to enforce judgments in Switzerland will be successful; in
particular, it is uncertain whether a Swiss court would recognize U.S. jurisdiction if the defendant did
not enter an appearance before a U.S. court during the substantive proceedings in the sense of
art. 6 of the Swiss Federal Act on International Private Law (Bundesgesetz ¨uber das internationale
_Privatrecht)._

381


-----

Furthermore, it is probable that a Swiss court, if substantive proceedings were commenced in
Switzerland, would not apply U.S. federal or state securities laws.

In addition, the recognition and enforcement of punitive damages awards might be denied by
Swiss courts as incompatible with Swiss public policy (schweizerischer Ordre public). Alternatively,
a Swiss court may reduce the amount of damages ordered by a U.S. court and recognize damages
only to the extent that they are necessary to compensate actual losses or damages.

Swiss civil procedure differs substantially from U.S. civil procedure in a number of respects.
With respect to the production of evidence, for example, U.S. federal and state law and the laws of
several other jurisdictions based on common law provide for pre-trial discovery, a process by which
parties to the proceedings may, prior to trial, compel the production of documents by adverse or
third parties and the depositions of witnesses. Evidence obtained in this manner may be decisive in
the outcome of any proceeding. In Switzerland, no such pre-trial discovery process exists. Instead,
a Swiss court would decide upon the claims for which evidence is required from the parties and the
related burden of proof.

**Review of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm**

The Board of Directors
Sealed Air Corporation

We have reviewed the condensed combined balance sheet of the Diversey Business and
subsidiaries as of March 31, 2017, and the related condensed combined statements of operations,
comprehensive income and cash flows for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2017 and
2016. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management.

We conducted our review in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America applicable to reviews of interim financial information. A
review of interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and
making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less
in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion
regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an
opinion.

Based on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to
the condensed combined financial statements referred to above for them to be in conformity with
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America, the combined balance sheet of Diversey Business and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 2016, and the related combined statements of operations,
comprehensive loss, invested equity and cash flows for the year then ended (not presented herein)
and we expressed an unqualified audit opinion on those combined financial statements in our
report dated May 31, 2017. In our opinion, the accompanying condensed combined balance sheet
of the Diversey Business and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2016, is fairly stated, in all material
respects, in relation to the combined balance sheet from which it has been derived.

**Note 1 Background and Basis of Presentation**

On March 25, 2017, Sealed Air Corporation (‘‘Sealed Air’’ or ‘‘Parent’’) entered into a definitive
agreement (the ‘‘Sale Transaction’’) to sell its Diversey Care division and the food hygiene and
cleaning business within its Food Care division (together ‘‘we’’, ‘‘Diversey Business’’, ‘‘Diversey’’, or
‘‘the Company’’). Diversey is a global provider of commercial cleaning, sanitation and hygiene
products, services and solutions for food safety and service, food and beverage plant operations,
floor care, housekeeping and room care, laundry and hand care. In addition, Diversey offers valueadded services, including food safety and application training and consulting, and auditing of
hygiene and water management. The Company’s offerings include Diversey�-branded total
integrated system solutions for facility hygiene, food safety and security, and infection control to
customers worldwide. Diversey�-branded products are focused on serving five key institutional and
industrial sectors globally, which include: food service operators, hospitality establishments and
building service contractors, food retail outlets, and healthcare facilities.

The product range of Diversey-branded solutions includes fully integrated lines of products
and dispensing systems for hard surface cleaning, disinfecting and sanitizing, hand washing,
deodorizing, mechanical and manual ware washing, hard surface and carpeted floor cleaning
systems, cleaning tools and utensils, and fabric care for professional laundry applications
comprising detergents, stain removers, bleaches and a broad range of dispensing equipment for
process control and management information systems. Floor care machines are commercialized
under the well-established Taski� brand, including Intellibot� floor cleaning robots.

_Basis of Presentation_

These condensed combined financial statements represent the global operations of Diversey,
and have been prepared on a carve-out basis. The condensed combined financial statements are
derived from Sealed Air’s consolidated financial statements and accounting records, and reflect the
Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America (‘‘GAAP’’).

These condensed combined financial statements include certain expenses which have been
allocated to the Company from Sealed Air. The allocation of these expenses is based on direct
usage when identifiable, or relative percentage of net sales or headcount when direct usage is not
identifiable. The Company considers the expense allocation methodology and results to be
reasonable for all periods presented. However, these allocations may not be indicative of the actual
expenses the Company would have incurred as a separate, carve-out company, or of the costs the
Company will incur in the future. The total amount of these allocations from Sealed Air was
approximately $19.0 million and $28.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and
2016, respectively. See Note 16, ‘‘Related Party Transactions’’, of the Notes to the Condensed
Combined Financial Statements for additional information.

Sealed Air maintains a number of share-based compensation programs at a corporate level.
Certain of the Company’s employees participate in those programs, and as such, the Company is
charged a portion of the expenses associated with these programs. However, the Condensed
Combined Balance Sheet does not reflect any Sealed Air equity related to these share-based
compensation programs. See Note 15, ‘‘Share-Based Compensation’’, of the Notes to the
Condensed Combined Financial Statements for further description of these share-based
compensation programs.

Diversey is the sponsor of several defined benefit retirement plans. In addition, Sealed Air
sponsors a number of defined benefit retirement plans in which both Diversey and Sealed Air
employees participate (‘‘Comingled Plans’’). For those plans, the Company is charged an allocation
of the expenses representing an estimate of employees expected to remain with Diversey following
the completion of the Sale Transaction. The Condensed Combined Balance Sheets also reflect an
allocation of the net obligation and accumulated other comprehensive income (‘‘AOCI’’) related to
the Comingled Plans, in addition to net obligations and AOCI for which Diversey is the sponsor.
See Note 12, ‘‘Defined Benefit Pension Plans and Other Post-Employment Benefit Plans’’, of the
Notes to the Condensed Combined Financial Statements for further description of these defined
benefit retirement plans.

_Impact of Inflation and Currency Fluctuation_

**_Venezuela_**

Economic and political events in Venezuela have continued to expose us to heightened levels
of foreign currency exchange risk. Accordingly, Venezuela has been designated a highly inflationary
economy under U.S. GAAP, and the U.S. dollar replaced the bolivar fuerte as the functional currency
for our subsidiaries in Venezuela. All bolivar-denominated monetary assets and liabilities are
remeasured into U.S. dollars using the current exchange rate available to us, and any changes in
the exchange rate are reflected in foreign currency exchange loss related to our Venezuelan
subsidiaries on the Condensed Combined Statements of Operations.

_2016 Activity_

Effective March 10, 2016, there were only two legal mechanisms in Venezuela to access
U.S. dollars. This included the DIPRO (10.0 bolivars per U.S. dollar), which replaced the CENCOEX
rate and is the preferential rate for essential goods and services and; the DICOM rate, which
replaced the SIMADI rate, which is allowed to float freely.

At March 31, 2016, we evaluated which legal mechanisms were available to our Venezuelan
subsidiaries to access U.S. dollars. We concluded that we would use the DICOM rate to remeasure
our bolivar denominated monetary assets and liabilities since it was our only legally available option
and our intent on a go-forward basis to utilize this market to settle any future transactions based on
the then current facts and circumstances. The DICOM rate as of March 31, 2016 was 272.9123.
During the first quarter of 2016, we were only able to access the SIMADI market (during the period
the market was available) and only received minimal amounts of U.S. dollars. We did not receive
any U.S. dollars via the CENCOEX (at an official rate of 6.3) or the DIPRO (at an official rate of
10.0). For any U.S. dollar denominated monetary asset or liability, such amounts do not get
remeasured at month-end since it is already an asset or liability denominated in U.S. dollars. As a
result of this evaluation, the Company reported a remeasurement loss of $0.7 million for the
three months ended March 31, 2016.

_2017 Activity_

At March 31, 2017, we concluded that we would continue to use the DICOM rate to remeasure
our remaining bolivar denominated monetary assets and liabilities since it was our only legally
available option and our intent on a go-forward basis to utilize this market if needed, to settle any

**Note 1 Background and Basis of Presentation (Continued)**

future transactions based on current facts and circumstances. During the first quarter of 2017, we
did not receive any U.S dollars via any of the legal mechanisms noted above. The DICOM rate as
of March 31, 2017 was 710.3638. As a result of this evaluation, the Company reported a
remeasurement loss of $0.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017.

We will continue to evaluate each reporting period the appropriate exchange rate to
remeasure our financial statements based on the facts and circumstances as applicable.

**Note 2 Recently Issued Accounting Standards**

**_Recently Adopted Accounting Standards_**

In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (‘‘FASB’’) issued Accounting
Standards Updates (‘‘ASU’’) 2016-09, Compensation — Stock Compensation (Topic 718):
Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting (‘‘ASU 2016-09’’). ASU 2016-09
simplifies the accounting for share-based payment award transactions including: income tax
consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the
statement of cash flows. Under previous guidance, excess tax benefits and certain tax deficiencies
from share-based compensation arrangements were recorded in additional paid-in-capital within
equity when the awards vested or were settled. ASU 2016-09 requires that all excess tax benefits
and all tax deficiencies be recognized as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement
and adoption was on a prospective basis. The Company elected to early adopt ASU 2016-09 in the
third quarter of 2016 which required us to reflect any adjustments as of January 1, 2016, the
beginning of the annual period that included the interim period of adoption.

**_Recently Issued Accounting Standards_**

In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-07, Compensation — Retirement Benefits
(Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Benefit Postretirement Benefit Cost
(‘‘ASU 2017-07’’). ASU 2017-017 changes how employers that sponsor defined benefit pension or
other postretirement benefit plans present the net periodic benefit cost in the income statement.
This new guidance requires entities to report the service cost component in the same line item or
items as other compensation costs. The other components of net benefit cost are required to be
presented in the income statement separately from the service cost component outside of income
from operations. The amendments in ASU 2017-07 are effective for annual periods beginning after
December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is
permitted for all entities as of the beginning of an annual reporting period for which financial
statements have not been issued or made available for issuance. We are currently in the process of
evaluating this new standard update.

In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Intangibles — Goodwill and Other
(Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment (‘‘ASU 2017-04’’). ASU 2017-04 eliminates
Step 2 as part of the goodwill impairment test. The amount of the impairment charge to be
recognized would now be the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the reporting unit’s fair
value. The loss to be recognized cannot exceed the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting
unit. The amendments in ASU 2017-04 are effective for annual or interim goodwill impairment tests
in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted for interim and

**DIVERSEY BUSINESS**

**Note 2 Recently Issued Accounting Standards (Continued)**

annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017. We are
currently in the process of evaluating this new standard update.

In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-01, Business Combinations (Topic 805):
Clarifying the Definition of a Business (‘‘ASU 2017-01’’). ASU 2017-01 provides a screen to
determine when a set is not a business. This screen states that when substantially all of the fair
value of the group assets acquired (or disposed of) is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or
group of similar identifiable assets, the set is not a business. The amendments in ASU 2017-01 are
effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within
those periods. Early application is permitted for transactions for which the acquisition date occurs
before the issuance date or effective date of the amendments, only when the transaction has not
been reported in financial statements that have been issued. We are currently in the process of
evaluating this new standard update.

In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230):
Restricted Cash (‘‘ASU 2016-18’’). ASU 2016-18 requires that entities include restricted cash and
restricted cash equivalents with cash and cash equivalents in the beginning-of-period and
end-of-period total amounts shown on the Statement of Cash Flows. The amendments in
ASU 2016-18 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim
reporting periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption, including adoption in interim periods, is
permitted for all entities. Retrospective transition method is to be applied to each period presented.
We are currently in the process of evaluating this new standard update.

In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity
Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory (‘‘ASU 2016-16’’). ASU 2016-16 requires entities to
recognize income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when
the transfer occurs. The amendments in ASU 2016-16 are effective for annual reporting periods
beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within those annual
reporting periods. Early adoption is permitted for all entities as of the beginning of an annual
reporting period for which financial statements have not been issued or made available for
issuance. We are currently in the process of evaluating this new standard update.

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230) —
Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (‘‘ASU 2016-15’’). ASU 2016-15
provides guidance on eight specific cash flow issues in regard to how cash receipts and cash
payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. The amendments in
ASU 2016-15 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim
periods within those years, with early adoption permitted. We are currently in the process of
evaluating this new standard update.

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments — Credit Losses
(Topic 326), Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (‘‘ASU 2016-13’’). ASU 2016-13
requires entities to measure all expected credit losses for most financial assets held at the reporting
date based on an expected loss model which includes historical experience, current conditions, and
reasonable and supportable forecasts. Entities will now use forward-looking information to better
form their credit loss estimates. The ASU also requires enhanced disclosures to help financial
statement users better understand significant estimates and judgments used in estimating credit
losses, as well as the credit quality and underwriting standards of an entity’s portfolio. ASU 2016-13

**DIVERSEY BUSINESS**

**Note 2 Recently Issued Accounting Standards (Continued)**

is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within
those fiscal periods. Entities may adopt earlier as of the fiscal year beginning after December 15,
2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We are currently in the process of
evaluating this new standard update.

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), (‘‘ASU 2016-02’’). This
ASU requires an entity to recognize a right-of-use asset and lease liability for all leases with terms
of more than 12 months. Recognition, measurement and presentation of expenses will depend on
classification as a finance or operating lease. Similar modifications have been made to lessor
accounting in-line with revenue recognition guidance. The amendments also require certain
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about leasing arrangements. The amendments in
ASU 2016-02 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim
periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The updated guidance requires a
modified retrospective adoption. We are currently in the process of evaluating this new standard
update.

In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments — Overall
(Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities
(‘‘ASU 2016-01’’). This ASU requires equity investments except those under the equity method of
accounting to be measured at fair value with the changes in fair value recognized in net income.
The amendment simplifies the impairment assessment of equity investments without readily
determinable fair values by requiring a qualitative assessment to identify impairment. In addition, it
also requires enhanced disclosures about investments. The amendments in ASU 2016-01 are
effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those
fiscal years. Early application for certain provisions is allowed but early adoption of the
amendments is not permitted. An entity should apply the amendments by means of a cumulativeeffect adjustment to the balance sheet as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. We are
currently in the process of evaluating this new standard update.

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers
(Topic 606), (‘‘ASU 2014-09’’) and issued subsequent amendments to the initial guidance in August
2015, March 2016, April 2016 and May 2016 within ASU 2015-04, ASU 2016-08, ASU 2016-10 and
ASU 2016-12, respectively (ASU 2014-09, ASU 2015-04, ASU 2016-08, ASU 2016-10, ASU 2016-12
and ASU 2017-05 collectively, Topic 606). Previous revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP
comprised broad revenue recognition concepts together with numerous revenue requirements for
particular industries or transactions, which sometimes resulted in different accounting for
economically similar transactions. The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should
recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount
that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those
goods or services. In addition, ASU 2014-09 expands and enhances disclosure requirements which
require disclosing sufficient information to enable users of financial statements to understand the
nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with
customers. This includes both qualitative and quantitative information. The amendments in
ASU 2014-09 are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017,
including interim periods within that reporting period. Early application is not permitted. In August
2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral
of the Effective Date, (‘‘ASU 2015-14’’). The amendments in ASU 2015-14 delay the effective date of

F-13

**DIVERSEY BUSINESS**

**Notes to Condensed Combined Financial Statements (unaudited) (Continued)**

**Note 2 Recently Issued Accounting Standards (Continued)**

ASU 2014-09 by one year to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and allow
early adoption as of the original public entity effective date. The amendments in ASU 2016-08,
ASU 2016-10 and ASU 2016-12 are effective in conjunction with ASU 2015-14.

The guidance permits two methods of adoption: full retrospective in which the standard is
applied to all of the periods presented or modified retrospective where an entity will have to
recognize the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard as an adjustment to the opening
balance of retained earnings. We currently anticipate adopting the modified retrospective method.

**Note 3 Acquisitions**

During the third quarter of 2016 the Company acquired Tampereen Teollsuuss¨ahk¨o Oy
(‘‘TTS-Ciptec’’) as part of Diversey Europe. The fair value of the consideration transferred was
$8.3 million which included $2.3 million related to the fair value of contingent consideration. The
purchase price allocation had not been completed as of March 31, 2017, as such, $8.5 million of
the purchase price has been preliminarily allocated to goodwill.

**Note 4 Segments**

The Company’s reporting structure consists of five reportable segments and a Corporate
category and is as follows:

   - North America;

   - Europe;

   - Middle East and Africa (‘‘MEA’’);

   - Latin America;

   - Asia Pacific; and

   - Corporate

The Company’s North America, Europe, MEA, Latin America and Asia Pacific segments are
considered reportable segments under FASB ASC Topic 280. Our reportable segments are aligned
with geographic regions. Corporate includes certain costs that are not allocated to the reportable
segments, as applicable, primarily consisting of unallocated corporate overhead costs, including
administrative functions and cost recovery variances not allocated to the reportable segments from
global functional expenses.

We allocate and disclose depreciation and amortization expense to our segments, although
property and equipment, net is not allocated to the segment assets, nor is depreciation and
amortization included in the segment performance metric Adjusted EBITDA. We also disclose
restructuring and other charges and impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets by
segment, although these items are not included in the segment performance metric Adjusted
EBITDA since restructuring and other charges and impairment of goodwill and other intangible
assets are categorized as Special Items as outlined in the table reconciling U.S. GAAP net income
to Non-U.S. GAAP Total Company Adjusted EBITDA set forth below. The accounting policies of the
reportable segments and Other are the same as those applied to the Condensed Combined
Financial Statements.

respectively, as a compensating balance for certain short-term borrowings, which is recorded in other current assets
on the Condensed Combined Balance Sheet.

**Note 10 Derivatives and Hedging Activities**

We report all derivative instruments on our Condensed Combined Balance Sheets at fair value
and establish criteria for designation and effectiveness of transactions entered into for hedging
purposes.

As a large global organization, we face exposure to market risks, such as fluctuations in
foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. To manage the volatility relating to these
exposures, we enter into various derivative instruments from time to time under our risk
management policies. We designate derivative instruments as hedges on a transaction basis to
support hedge accounting. The changes in fair value of these hedging instruments offset in part or
in whole corresponding changes in the fair value or cash flows of the underlying exposures being
hedged. We assess the initial and ongoing effectiveness of our hedging relationships in accordance
with our policy. We do not purchase, hold or sell derivative financial instruments for trading
purposes. Our practice is to terminate derivative transactions if the underlying asset or liability
matures or is sold or terminated, or if we determine the underlying forecasted transaction is no
longer probable of occurring.

We record the fair value positions of all derivative financial instruments on a net basis by
counterparty for which a master netting arrangement is utilized.

**Notes to Condensed Combined Financial Statements (unaudited) (Continued)**

**Note 10 Derivatives and Hedging Activities (Continued)**

**_Foreign Currency Forward Contracts Designated as Cash Flow Hedges_**

The primary purpose of our cash flow hedging activities is to manage the potential changes in
value associated with the amounts receivable or payable on equipment and raw material purchases
that are denominated in foreign currencies in order to minimize the impact of the changes in foreign
currencies. We record gains and losses on foreign currency forward contracts qualifying as cash
flow hedges in other comprehensive income to the extent that these hedges are effective and until
we recognize the underlying transactions in net earnings, at which time we recognize these gains
and losses in cost of sales on our Condensed Combined Statements of Operations. Cash flows
from non-designated derivative financial instruments are classified as cash flows from operating
activities in the Condensed Combined Statements of Cash Flows. These contracts generally have
original maturities of less than 12 months.

Net unrealized after-tax gains/losses related to these contracts that were included in other
comprehensive income were $1.0 million loss for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and
$0.5 million loss for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The unrealized amounts in other
comprehensive income will fluctuate based on changes in the fair value of open contracts during
each reporting period.

We estimate that $0 4 million of net unrealized derivative gains included in accumulated other
comprehensive income (AOCI) will be reclassified into earnings within the next twelve months.

**_Foreign Currency Forward Contracts Not Designated as Hedges_**

Our subsidiaries have foreign currency exchange exposure from buying and selling in
currencies other than their functional currencies. The primary purposes of our foreign currency
hedging activities are to manage the potential changes in value associated with the amounts
receivable or payable on transactions denominated in foreign currencies and to minimize the
impact of the changes in foreign currencies related to foreign currency-denominated interestbearing intercompany loans and receivables and payables. The changes in fair value of these
derivative contracts are recognized in other income, net on our Condensed Combined Statements
of Operations and are largely offset by the remeasurement of the underlying foreign currencydenominated items indicated above. Cash flows from derivative financial instruments are classified
as cash flows from investing activities in the Condensed Combined Statements of Cash Flows.
These contracts generally have original maturities of less than 12 months.

**_Interest Rate Swaps_**

From time to time, we may use interest rate swaps to manage our fixed and floating interest
rates on our outstanding indebtedness. At March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, we had no
outstanding interest rate swaps.

**_Interest Rate and Currency Swaps_**

In 2014, in connection with exercising the $100.0 million delayed draw under the senior
secured credit facility, we entered into a series of interest rate and currency swaps in a notional
amount of $100.0 million On September 30, 2016, the first $20.0 million swap contract matured and
was settled. As a result of the settlement, the Company received $4.9 million On March 31, 2017, a

F-22

**DIVERSEY BUSINESS**

**Notes to Condensed Combined Financial Statements (unaudited) (Continued)**

**Note 10 Derivatives and Hedging Activities (Continued)**

settlement payment was made for $1.8 million. These swaps convert the U.S. dollar-denominated
variable rate obligation under the credit facility into a fixed Brazilian real-denominated obligation.
The delayed draw and the interest rate and currency swaps are used to fund expansion and
general corporate purposes of our Brazilian subsidiaries.

**_Net Investment Hedge_**

In March 2015, we entered into a series of cross-currency swaps with a combined notional
amount of $425.0 million, hedging a portion of the net investment in a certain European subsidiary
against fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The fair value of this hedge as of March 31, 2017
was $(7.0) million ($(4.3) million after tax) on our Condensed Combined Balance Sheet.

For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedges of net investments in
foreign operations, settlements and changes in fair values of the derivative instruments are
recognized in unrealized net gains or loss on derivative instruments for net investment hedge, a
component of AOCI, net of taxes, to offset the changes in the values of the net investments being
hedged. Any portion of the net investment hedge that is determined to be ineffective is recorded in
other income, net on the Condensed Combined Statements of Operations.

**_Other Derivative Instruments_**

We may use other derivative instruments from time to time to manage exposure to foreign
exchange rates and to access to international financing transactions. These instruments can
potentially limit foreign exchange exposure by swapping borrowings denominated in one currency
for borrowings denominated in another currency.

**_Fair Value of Derivative Instruments_**

See Note 11, ‘‘Fair Value Measurements and Other Financial Instruments’’, for a discussion of
the inputs and valuation techniques used to determine the fair value of our outstanding derivative
instruments.

**Note 11 Fair Value Measurements and Other Financial Instruments**

**_Fair Value Measurements_**

In determining fair value of financial instruments, we utilize valuation techniques that maximize
the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to the extent possible
and consider counterparty credit risk in our assessment of fair value. We determine fair value of our
financial instruments based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset
or liability in the principal or most advantageous market. When considering market participant
assumptions in fair value measurements, the following fair value hierarchy distinguishes between
observable and unobservable inputs, which are categorized in one of the following levels:

   - Level 1 Inputs: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
accessible to the reporting entity at the measurement date.

   - Level 2 Inputs: Other than quoted prices included in Level 1 inputs that are observable for
the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or
liability.

   - Level 3 Inputs: Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability used to measure fair value to
the extent that observable inputs are not available, thereby allowing for situations in which
there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at measurement date.

The following table details the fair value hierarchy of our financial instruments:

**Note 11 Fair Value Measurements and Other Financial Instruments (Continued)**

**_Cash Equivalents_**

Our cash equivalents at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 consisted of bank time
deposits (Level 1). Since these are short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of
three months or less at the date of purchase, they present negligible risk of changes in fair value
due to changes in interest rates.

**_Compensating Balance Deposits_**

We have compensating balance deposits related to certain short-term borrowings. These
represent bank certificates of deposits that will mature within the next 3 months.

**_Derivative Financial Instruments_**

Our foreign currency forward contracts, foreign currency options, euro-denominated debt,
interest rate and currency swaps and cross-currency swaps are recorded at fair value on our
Condensed Combined Balance Sheets using a discounted cash flow analysis that incorporates
observable market inputs. These market inputs include foreign currency spot and forward rates, and
various interest rate curves, and are obtained from pricing data quoted by various banks, third party
sources and foreign currency dealers involving identical or comparable instruments (Level 2).

Counterparties to these foreign currency forward contracts have at least an investment grade
rating. Credit ratings on some of our counterparties may change during the term of our financial
instruments. We closely monitor our counterparties’ credit ratings and, if necessary, will make any
appropriate changes to our financial instruments. The fair value generally reflects the estimated
amounts that we would receive or pay to terminate the contracts at the reporting date.

**_Other Financial Instruments_**

The following financial instruments are recorded at fair value or at amounts that approximate
fair value: (1) trade receivables, net, (2) certain other current assets, (3) accounts payable and
(4) other current liabilities. The carrying amounts reported on our Condensed Combined Balance
Sheets for the above financial instruments closely approximate their fair value due to the short-term
nature of these assets and liabilities.

Other liabilities that are recorded at carrying value on our Condensed Combined Balance
Sheets include our senior notes, except for our euro-denominated debt as discussed above. We
utilize a market approach to calculate the fair value of our senior notes. Due to their limited investor
base and the face value of some of our senior notes, they may not be actively traded on the date
we calculate their fair value. Therefore, we may utilize prices and other relevant information
generated by market transactions involving similar securities, reflecting U.S. Treasury yields to
calculate the yield to maturity and the price on some of our senior notes. These inputs are provided
by an independent third party and are considered to be Level 2 inputs.

We derive our fair value estimates of our various other debt instruments by evaluating the
nature and terms of each instrument, considering prevailing economic and market conditions, and
examining the cost of similar debt offered at the balance sheet date. We also incorporated our
credit default swap rates and currency specific swap rates in the valuation of each debt instrument,
as applicable.

These estimates are subjective and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment,
and therefore we cannot determine them with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly
affect our estimates.

(1) Includes borrowings denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars.

In addition to the table above, the Company remeasures amounts related to contingent
consideration liabilities related to acquisitions and certain equity compensation, that were carried at
fair value on a recurring basis in the Condensed Combined Financial Statements or for which a fair
value measurement was required. Refer to Note 3 ‘‘Acquisitions’’ of the Notes to Condensed
Combined Financial Statements for information regarding contingent consideration and Note 15
‘‘Share-Based Compensation’’ of the Notes to Condensed Combined Financial Statements for
share-based compensation. Included among our non-financial assets and liabilities that are not
required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis are inventories, net property and
equipment, goodwill, intangible assets and asset retirement obligations.

**_Credit and Market Risk_**

Financial instruments, including derivatives, expose us to counterparty credit risk for
nonperformance and to market risk related to changes in interest or currency exchange rates. We
manage our exposure to counterparty credit risk through specific minimum credit standards,
establishing credit limits, diversification of counterparties, and procedures to monitor concentrations
of credit risk.

We do not expect any of our counterparties in derivative transactions to fail to perform as it is
our policy to have counterparties to these contracts that have at least an investment grade rating.
Nevertheless, there is a risk that our exposure to losses arising out of derivative contracts could be
material if the counterparties to these agreements fail to perform their obligations. We will replace
counterparties if a credit downgrade is deemed to increase our risk to unacceptable levels.

We regularly monitor the impact of market risk on the fair value and cash flows of our
derivative and other financial instruments considering reasonably possible changes in interest and
currency exchange rates and restrict the use of derivative financial instruments to hedging activities.
We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes and do not
use leveraged derivative financial instruments.

**Note 11 Fair Value Measurements and Other Financial Instruments (Continued)**

We continually monitor the creditworthiness of our diverse base of customers to which we
grant credit terms in the normal course of business and generally do not require collateral. We
consider the concentrations of credit risk associated with our trade accounts receivable to be
commercially reasonable and believe that such concentrations do not leave us vulnerable to
significant risks of near-term severe adverse impacts. The terms and conditions of our credit sales
are designed to mitigate concentrations of credit risk with any single customer. Our sales are not
materially dependent on a single customer or a small group of customers.

**Note 13 Income Taxes**

The Company accounts for income taxes for interim periods in accordance with ASC 740
which requires income tax expense or benefit to be calculated using an estimated annual effective
tax rate. If a reliable estimate of the annual effective tax rate cannot be made, the Company
considers the effective tax rate for the year to date to be the best estimate. Accordingly, the income
tax provisions for the three months ended March 31, 2017, were determined based on the actual
year-to-date tax expense because a reliable estimate of the annual effective tax rate cannot be
made. To provide greater comparability, the income tax provision for the three months ended
March 31, 2016 was also determined based on the year to date tax expense.

**Note 13 Income Taxes (Continued)**

**_Effective Income Tax Rate and Income Tax Provision_**

Our effective income tax rate and tax expense for the three months ended March 31, 2017
was 160.9% and $7.7 million. The increase in our effective income tax rate as compared to the
statutory rate is primarily attributable to an increase in valuation allowance on domestic losses and
credits, partially offset by a change in the deferred tax liability related to the permanent
reinvestments assertion.

Our income tax expense for the three months ended March 31, 2016 was $5.4 million on a
pre-tax loss. The difference in tax expense compared to expense based on the statutory rate is
primarily attributable to an increase in valuation allowance on domestic losses and credits.

**_Unrecognized Tax Benefits_**

During the three months ended March 31, 2017, we decreased our unrecognized tax benefits
by $2.7 million We have not changed our policy with regard to the reporting of penalties and
interest related to unrecognized tax benefits.

**Note 14 Commitments and Contingencies**

**_Environmental Matters_**

We are subject to loss contingencies resulting from environmental laws and regulations, and
we accrue for anticipated costs associated with investigatory and remediation efforts when an
assessment has indicated that a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. These accruals
are not reduced by potential insurance recoveries, if any. We do not believe that it is reasonably
possible that our liability in excess of the amounts that we have accrued for environmental matters
will be material to our Condensed Combined Balance Sheet or Statement of Operations.
Environmental liabilities are reassessed whenever circumstances become better defined or
remediation efforts and their costs can be better estimated.

We evaluate these liabilities periodically based on available information, including the progress
of remedial investigations at each site, the current status of discussions with regulatory authorities
regarding the methods and extent of remediation and the apportionment of costs among potentially
responsible parties. As some of these issues are decided (the outcomes of which are subject to
uncertainties) or new sites are assessed and costs can be reasonably estimated, we adjust the
recorded accruals, as necessary. We believe that these exposures are not material to our
Condensed Combined Balance Sheet or Statement of Operations. We believe that we have
adequately reserved for all probable and estimable environmental exposures.

**_Guarantees and Indemnification Obligations_**

We are a party to many contracts containing guarantees and indemnification obligations.
These contracts primarily consist of:

   - product warranties with respect to certain products sold to customers in the ordinary course
of business. These warranties typically provide that products will conform to specifications.
We generally do not establish a liability for product warranty based on a percentage of sales
or other formula. We accrue a warranty liability on a transaction-specific basis depending on

**Note 14 Commitments and Contingencies (Continued)**

the individual facts and circumstances related to each sale. Both the liability and annual
expense related to product warranties are immaterial to our Condensed Combined Balance
Sheet or Statement of Operations; and

   - licenses of intellectual property by us to third parties in which we have agreed to indemnify
the licensee against third party infringement claims.

**Note 15 Share-Based Compensation**

Sealed Air has a combined incentive plan in which the Company participates. The plan
provides for the grant of Sealed Air stock options, Sealed Air stock appreciation rights, Sealed Air
restricted stock, Sealed Air restricted stock units, Sealed Air unrestricted stock, Sealed Air
performance share units known as PSU awards, other stock awards and cash awards to officers
and key employees.

We record share-based incentive compensation expense in selling, general and administrative
expenses and cost of sales on our Combined Statements of Operations for both equity-classified
awards and liability-classified awards. We record corresponding credit to current or non-current
liability for liability-classified awards based on the fair value of the share-based incentive
compensation awards at the date of grant. Total expense for the liability-classified awards continues
to be remeasured to fair value at the end of each reporting period. We recognize an expense or
credit reflecting the straight-line recognition, net of estimated forfeitures, of the expected cost of the
program. The number of PSUs earned may equal, exceed or be less than the targeted number of
shares depending on whether the performance criteria are met, surpassed or not met.

The following table summarizes the Company’s pre-tax share-based incentive compensation
expense for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 related to participation in Sealed
Air’s PSU awards, SLO awards and restricted stock awards.

the basis of direct usage when identifiable, with the remainder allocated on the basis on net sales,
headcount, or other measures. During the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, the
Company was allocated $19.0 million and $28.8 million, respectively, for general corporate
expenses incurred by Sealed Air, which is primarily included within selling, general and
administrative expenses and other income (expense) in the Condensed Combined Statements of
Operations.

**_Related Party Receivables and Payables_**

As of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the Company had estimated receivable

included in other receivables and other non-current assets on the Condensed Combined Balance
Sheets. As of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the Company had estimated payable
balances due to Sealed Air totaling $156.9 million and $142.2 million, respectively, which are
included in accounts payable and other non-current liabilities on the Condensed Combined Balance
Sheets. The Company expects the remaining receivable/payable balance will not be settled in cash
and are recorded in net parent investment.

**Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm**

The Board of Directors
Sealed Air Corporation

We have audited the accompanying combined balance sheets of the Diversey Business and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the related combined statements of
operations, comprehensive income (loss), invested equity and cash flows for the years then ended.
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States) and in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in
the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects,
the combined financial position of the Diversey Business and subsidiaries at December 31, 2016
and 2015, and the combined results of their operations and their cash flows for the years then
ended in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

**Note 1 Background and Basis of Presentation**

On March 25, 2017, Sealed Air Corporation (‘‘Sealed Air’’ or ‘‘Parent’’) entered into a definitive
agreement (the ‘‘Sale Transaction’’) to sell its Diversey Care division and the food hygiene and
cleaning business within its Food Care division (together ‘‘we’’, ‘‘Diversey Business’’, ‘‘Diversey’’, or
‘‘the Company’’). Diversey is a global provider of commercial cleaning, sanitation and hygiene
products, services and solutions for food safety and service, food and beverage plant operations,
floor care, housekeeping and room care, laundry and hand care. In addition, Diversey offers valueadded services, including food safety and application training and consulting, and auditing of
hygiene and water management. The Company’s offerings include Diversey�-branded total
integrated system solutions for facility hygiene, food safety and security, and infection control to
customers worldwide. Diversey�-branded products are focused on serving five key institutional and
industrial sectors globally, which include: food service operators, hospitality establishments and
building service contractors, food retail outlets, and healthcare facilities.

The product range of Diversey-branded solutions includes fully integrated lines of products
and dispensing systems for hard surface cleaning, disinfecting and sanitizing, hand washing,
deodorizing, mechanical and manual ware washing, hard surface and carpeted floor cleaning
systems, cleaning tools and utensils, and fabric care for professional laundry applications
comprising detergents, stain removers, bleaches and a broad range of dispensing equipment for
process control and management information systems. Floor care machines are commercialized
under the well-established Taski � brand, including Intellibot� floor cleaning robots.

_Basis of Presentation_

These combined financial statements represent the global operations of Diversey, and have
been prepared on a carve-out basis. The combined financial statements are derived from Sealed
Air’s consolidated financial statements and accounting records, and reflect the Company’s financial
position, results of operations and cash flows in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America (‘‘GAAP’’).

These combined financial statements include certain expenses which have been allocated to
the Company from Sealed Air. The allocation of these expenses is based on direct usage when
identifiable, or relative percentage of net sales or headcount when direct usage is not identifiable.
The Company considers the expense allocation methodology and results to be reasonable for all
periods presented. However, these allocations may not be indicative of the actual expenses the
Company would have incurred as a separate, carve-out company, or of the costs the Company will
incur in the future. Following the sale, we expect Sealed Air to continue to provide many of these
services on a transitional and temporary basis for a fee. The total amount of these allocations from
Sealed Air was approximately $110.0 million and $118.9 million for the years ended December 31,
2016 and 2015, respectively. See Note 18, ‘‘Related Party Transactions’’, of the Notes to the
Combined Financial Statements for additional information.

Sealed Air maintains a number of stock-based compensation programs at a corporate level.
Certain of the Company’s employees participate in those programs, and as such, the Company is
charged a portion of the expenses associated with these programs. However, the Combined
Balance Sheet does not reflect any Sealed Air equity related to these share-based compensation
programs. See Note 17, ‘‘Share-Based Compensation’’, of the Notes to the Combined Financial
Statements for further description of these share-based compensation programs.

**Note 1 Background and Basis of Presentation (Continued)**

Diversey is the sponsor of several defined benefit retirement plans. In addition, Sealed Air
sponsors a number of defined benefit retirement plans in which both Diversey and Sealed Air
employees participate (‘‘Comingled Plans’’). For those plans, the Company is charged an allocation
of the expenses representing an estimate of employees expected to remain with Diversey following
the completion of the Sale Transaction. The Combined Balance Sheets also reflect an allocation of
the net obligation and accumulated other comprehensive income (‘‘AOCI’’) related to the
Comingled Plans, in addition to net obligations and AOCI for which Diversey is the sponsor. See
Note 13, ‘‘Profit Sharing, Retirement Savings Plans and Defined Benefit Pension Plans’’, and
Note 14, ‘‘Other Post-Employment Benefits and Other Employee Benefit Plans’’, of the Notes to the
Combined Financial Statements for further description of these defined benefit retirement plans.

**Accounting Standards**

**_Summary of Significant Accounting Policies_**

_Use of Estimates_

The preparation of our Combined Financial Statements and related disclosures in conformity
with U.S. GAAP requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the
date of the financial statements and revenue and expenses during the period reported. These
estimates include, among other items, assessing the collectability of receivables, the use and
recoverability of inventory, the estimation of fair value of financial instruments, assumptions used in
the calculation of income taxes, useful lives and recoverability of tangible assets and goodwill and
other intangible assets, assumptions used in our defined benefit pension plans and other post
employment benefit plans, estimates related to self-insurance such as the aggregate liability for
uninsured claims using historical experience, insurance and actuarial estimates and estimated
trends in claim values, fair value measurement of assets, costs for incentive compensation and
accruals for commitments and contingencies. We review these estimates and assumptions
periodically using historical experience and other factors and reflect the effects of any revisions in
the Combined Financial Statements in the period we determine any revisions to be necessary.
Actual results could differ from these estimates.

_Financial Instruments_

We may use financial instruments, such as cross-currency swaps, interest rate swaps, caps
and collars, U.S. Treasury lock agreements and foreign currency exchange forward contracts and
options relating to our borrowing and trade activities. We may use these financial instruments from
time to time to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange
rates. We do not purchase, hold or sell derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. We
face credit risk if the counterparties to these transactions are unable to perform their obligations.
Our policy is to have counterparties to these contracts that are rated at least BBB� by Standard &
Poor’s and Baa3 by Moody’s.

We report derivative instruments at fair value and establish criteria for designation and
effectiveness of transactions entered into for hedging purposes. Before entering into any derivative
transaction, we identify our specific financial risk, the appropriate hedging instrument to use to

**Accounting Standards (Continued)**

reduce this risk, and the correlation between the financial risk and the hedging instrument. We use
forecasts and historical data as the basis for determining the anticipated values of the transactions
to be hedged. We do not enter into derivative transactions that do not have a high correlation with
the underlying financial risk we are trying to reduce. We regularly review our hedge positions and
the correlation between the transaction risks and the hedging instruments.

We account for derivative instruments as hedges of the related underlying risks if we
designate these derivative instruments as hedges and the derivative instruments are effective as
hedges of recognized assets or liabilities, forecasted transactions, unrecognized firm commitments
or forecasted intercompany transactions.

We record gains and losses on derivatives qualifying as cash flow hedges in other
comprehensive loss, to the extent that hedges are effective and until the underlying transactions are
recognized on the Combined Statements of Operations, at which time we recognize the gains and
losses on the Combined Statements of Operations.

Generally, our practice is to terminate derivative transactions if the underlying asset or liability
matures or is sold or terminated, or if we determine the underlying forecasted transaction is no
longer probable of occurring. Any deferred gains or losses associated with derivative instruments
are recognized on the Combined Statements of Operations over the period in which the income or
expense on the underlying hedged transaction is recognized.

See Note 11, ‘‘Derivatives and Hedging Activities’’, of the Notes to Combined Financial
Statements for further details.

_Fair Value Measurements of Financial Instruments_

In determining fair value of financial instruments, we utilize valuation techniques that maximize
the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to the extent possible
and consider counterparty credit risk in our assessment of fair value. We determine fair value of our
financial instruments based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset
or liability in the principal or most advantageous market. When considering market participant
assumptions in fair value measurements, the following fair value hierarchy distinguishes between
observable and unobservable inputs, which are categorized in one of the following levels:

   - Level 1 Inputs: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
accessible to the reporting entity at the measurement date.

   - Level 2 Inputs: Other than quoted prices included in Level 1 inputs that are observable for
the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or
liability.

   - Level 3 Inputs: Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability used to measure fair value to
the extent that observable inputs are not available, thereby allowing for situations in which
there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at measurement date.

Our fair value measurements for our financial instruments are subjective and involve
uncertainties and matters of significant judgment. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect

**Accounting Standards (Continued)**

our estimates. See Note 12, ‘‘Fair Value Measurements and Other Financial Instruments’’, of the
Notes to Combined Financial Statements for further details on our fair value measurements.

_Foreign Currency Translation_

In non-U.S. locations that are not considered highly inflationary, we translate the balance
sheets at the end of period exchange rates with translation adjustments accumulated in invested
equity on our Combined Balance Sheets. We translate the statements of operations at the average
exchange rates during the applicable period.

We translate assets and liabilities of our operations in countries with highly inflationary
economies at the end of period exchange rates, except that nonmonetary asset and liability
amounts are translated at historical exchange rates. In countries with highly inflationary economies,
we translate items reflected in the statements of operations at average rates of exchange prevailing
during the period, except that nonmonetary amounts are translated at historical exchange rates.

_Impact of Inflation and Currency Fluctuation_

**_Venezuela_**

Economic and political events in Venezuela have continued to expose us to heightened levels
of foreign currency exchange risk. Accordingly, Venezuela has been designated a highly inflationary
economy under U.S. GAAP, and the U.S. dollar replaced the bolivar fuerte as the functional currency
for our subsidiaries in Venezuela. All bolivar-denominated monetary assets and liabilities are
re-measured into U.S. dollars using the current exchange rate available to us, and any changes in
the exchange rate are reflected in foreign currency exchange gains and losses related to our
Venezuelan subsidiaries on the Combined Statements of Operations.

_2015 Activity_

In February 2015, the Venezuelan government announced a new foreign exchange platform
called the Marginal Currency System or SIMADI. The SIMADI basically replaced the SICAD 2 rate as
noted above. When this market opened on February 12, 2015 the rate was 170.0390 and then at
December 31, 2015 it was 198.6986. The SICAD 1 and the SICAD 2 were merged into the SICAD.
The opening rate was 12.0 for the SICAD and at December 31, 2015 it was 13.5. In addition, the
CENCOEX will continue and provide preferential treatment for certain import operations such as
food and medicines.

Since these changes were announced by the Venezuelan government, the new SIMADI market
had very little activity and companies have not been able to access this market to obtain U.S.
dollars. In addition, the SICAD rate which is established via auctions had no auctions held since
October 2014. However, in June 2015 an auction was held for the automotive parts and school
supplies industries.

Therefore, in 2015 there were three legal mechanisms to exchange bolivars for U.S. dollars:

   - CENCOEX at the official rate of 6.3;

F-45

**DIVERSEY BUSINESS**

**Notes to Combined Financial Statements (Continued)**

**Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Recently Issued and Adopted**
**Accounting Standards (Continued)**

   - SICAD auction process at the awarded exchange rate (opening rate at 12.0 and at
December 31, 2015 it was 13.5); and

   - SIMADI at the negotiated rate (rate of 198.6986 at December 31, 2015).

At December 31, 2015, we evaluated which legal mechanisms were available to our
Venezuelan subsidiaries to access U.S. dollars. Starting June 2015 and at December 31, 2015, we
concluded that we would use the SIMADI rate to remeasure our bolivar denominated monetary
assets and liabilities since it was our only legally available option and our intent on a go-forward
basis to utilize this market to settle any future transactions based on then current facts and
circumstances. During 2015, the Company did not receive U.S. dollars via the CENCOEX official
rate of 6.3. We were only able to access the SIMADI market and only received minimal amounts of
U.S. dollars. As a result of this evaluation, the Company reported a remeasurement loss of
$5.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.

_2016 Activity_

On February 17, 2016, the Venezuelan government made further changes to the exchange
rates including a further devaluation and on March 9, 2016 published in Exchange Agreement
No. 35 further rules governing foreign exchange transactions which were effective March 10, 2016.
This includes the following key changes:

   - The preferential rate for essential goods and services was changed from 6.3 to 10.0 bolivars
per U.S. dollar and is no longer called CENCOEX but is now the DIPRO;

   - The SICAD rate was eliminated which reduced the number of legal mechanisms from three
down to only two; and

   - Eliminated the SIMADI rate which was replaced by the DICOM rate which will be allowed to
float freely beginning at a rate of approximately 203.0 bolivars to U.S. dollar.

At December 31, 2016, we evaluated which legal mechanisms were available to our
Venezuelan subsidiaries to access U.S. dollars. As noted above, the SIMADI rate was replaced with
the DICOM rate. Consistent with our evaluation completed in the first, second and third quarters of
2016, we concluded that we will continue to use the DICOM rate to remeasure our bolivardenominated monetary assets and liabilities since it is our only legally available option and our
intent on a go-forward basis to utilize this market if needed, to settle any future transactions based
on current facts and circumstances. The DICOM rate as of December 31, 2016 was 673.7617.

We will continue to evaluate each reporting period the appropriate exchange rate to
remeasure our financial statements based on the facts and circumstances as applicable.

During 2016, we were only able to access the SIMADI market (during the period the market
was available) and only received minimal amounts of U.S. dollars during the first three months of
2016. We did not receive any U.S. dollars via the CENCOEX (at an official rate of 6.3) or the DIPRO
(at an official rate of 10.0). We expect that we will only have limited access to the DIPRO market to
settle certain past transactions. However, if the option becomes available to us to use the DIPRO in
the future, the Company will consider this further, as needed. For any U.S. dollar-denominated
monetary asset or liability, such amounts do not get remeasured at month-end since it is already an

asset or liability denominated in U.S. dollars. As a result of this evaluation, the Company reported a
remeasurement loss of $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.

Due to the ongoing challenging economic situation in Venezuela, the Company approved a
program in the second quarter of 2016 to cease operations in the country. Foreign exchange
control regulations have affected our Venezuelan subsidiaries’ ability to obtain inventory and
maintain normal production. This resulted in total costs of $4.5 million being incurred which
included the following (i) a voluntary reduction in headcount including severance and termination
benefits for employees of $0.1 million, (ii) depreciation and amortization expense related to fixed
assets and intangibles of $4.2 million, (iii) inventory reserves of $0.6 million and (iv) offset by the
reclassification of $0.4 million of cumulative translation adjustment resulting in a charge to net
income as the Company’s decision to cease operations is similar to a substantially complete
liquidation.

_Commitments and Contingencies — Litigation_

On an ongoing basis, we assess the potential liabilities related to any lawsuits or claims
brought against us. While it is typically very difficult to determine the timing and ultimate outcome of
these actions, we use our best judgment to determine if it is probable that we will incur an expense
related to the settlement or final adjudication of these matters and whether a reasonable estimation
of the probable loss, if any, can be made. In assessing probable losses, we make estimates of the
amount of insurance recoveries, if any. We accrue a liability when we believe a loss is probable and
the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Due to the inherent uncertainties related to the
eventual outcome of litigation and potential insurance recovery, it is possible that disputed matters
may be resolved for amounts materially different from any provisions or disclosures that we have
previously made. We expense legal costs, including those legal costs expected to be incurred in
connection with a loss contingency, as incurred.

_Revenue Recognition_

Our revenue earning activities primarily involve manufacturing and selling products, and we
consider revenues to be earned when we have completed the process by which we are entitled to
receive consideration. The following criteria are used for revenue recognition: persuasive evidence
that an arrangement exists, shipment has occurred, selling price is fixed or determinable, and
collection is reasonably assured.

Sales taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are accounted
for on a net basis and therefore are excluded from net sales on the Combined Statements of
Operations.

Charges for rebates and other allowances are recognized as a deduction from revenue on an
accrual basis in the period in which the associated revenue is recorded. When we estimate our
rebate accruals, we consider customer-specific contractual commitments including stated rebate
rates and history of actual rebates paid. Our rebate accruals are reviewed at each reporting period
and adjusted to reflect data available at that time. We adjust the accruals to reflect any differences
between estimated and actual amounts. These adjustments impact the amount of net sales

F-47


-----

**DIVERSEY BUSINESS**

**Notes to Combined Financial Statements (Continued)**

**Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Recently Issued and Adopted**
**Accounting Standards (Continued)**

recognized by us in the period of adjustment. Charges for rebates and other allowances were
approximately 11% of gross sales in 2016 and 2015.

In certain instances, we may incur incremental direct costs of a revenue transaction, such as
prebates, or other related expenses in the contract negotiation phase. Because these costs are
likely incurred to transition to the new relationship or to entice a customer into a long-term
relationship, these costs may be deferred if the related revenues have also been deferred as long
as the contract requires reimbursement to the company if the customer terminates the contract
before expiration or does not meet the sales, new business, or other performance requirements of
the contract. Costs that are directly related to the acquisition of a contract and that would have not
been incurred but for the acquisition of that contract should be deferred and charged to expense in
proportion to the revenue recognized.

_Shipping and Handling Costs_

Costs incurred for the transfer and delivery of goods to customers are recorded as a
component of cost of sales.

_Research and Development_

We expense research and development costs as incurred. Research and development costs
were $49.2 million in 2016 and $51.2 million in 2015.

_Share-Based Incentive Compensation_

We record share-based compensation awards exchanged for employee services at fair value
on the date of grant and record the expense for these awards in cost of sales and in selling,
general and administrative expense, as applicable, on our Combined Statements of Operations over
the requisite employee service period. Share-based incentive compensation expense includes an
estimate for forfeitures and anticipated achievement levels and is generally recognized over the
expected term of the award on a straight-line basis. The Company accelerates expense using a
graded vesting schedule for employees who meet retirement eligibility requirements prior to the end
of the award’s service period. For performance-based awards, the Company reassesses at each
reporting date whether achievement of the performance condition is probable and accrues
compensation expense if and when achievement of the performance condition is probable. For
market based awards, the fair value of the award is determined at the grant date and is recognized
at 100% over the performance period regardless of actual market condition performance.

_Environmental Expenditures_

We expense or capitalize environmental expenditures that relate to ongoing business activities,
as appropriate. We expense costs that relate to an existing condition caused by previous operations
and which do not contribute to current or future net sales. We record liabilities when we determine
that environmental assessments or remediation expenditures are probable and that we can
reasonably estimate the associated cost or a range of costs.

_Income Taxes_

The Company’s taxable income was historically included in the U.S. federal and certain state
income tax returns of Sealed Air. In the accompanying Combined Financial Statements, the
Company’s provision for income taxes is computed following the separate return method. On a
consolidated basis, Sealed Air has significant tax attributes such as foreign tax credit carryovers
and net operating loss carryovers in various jurisdictions around the world. Because the Company
is a part of the same Sealed Air legal entities that generated many of these tax attributes, Sealed Air
has allocated certain of these attributes to the Company. The Company has recorded a tax benefit
for these attributes in its separate return tax provision. These attributes may not be transferred to
newly created legal entities in an asset sale transactions or other disposition transactions.

With the exception of certain dedicated foreign entities, the Company does not maintain taxes
payable to and from Sealed Air and the Company is deemed to settle the annual current tax
balances immediately with the legal entities liable for the taxes in the respective jurisdictions. These
settlements are reflected as changes in net parent investment. The Combined Statements of Cash
Flows reflect cash paid for income taxes including the Company’s cash taxes paid to tax authorities
as well as tax payments which are deemed settled with Sealed Air as the tax payer during these
time periods.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized with respect to the expected future tax
consequences of events that have been recorded in the Combined Financial Statements. If it is
more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation
allowance is provided against such deferred tax assets. The assessment of realization of deferred
tax assets is performed based on the weight of the positive and negative evidence available to
indicate whether the asset is recoverable, including tax planning strategies that are prudent and
feasible.

Tax benefits from an uncertain tax position are recognized only if it is more likely than not that
the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical
merits of the position. Tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are
measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being
realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company evaluates such likelihood based on relevant facts
and tax law.

See Note 15, ‘‘Income Taxes’’, of the Notes to Combined Financial Statements for further
discussion.

_Cash and Cash Equivalents_

We consider highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the
date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Our policy is to invest cash in excess of short-term
operating and debt service requirements in cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are stated at cost,
which approximates fair value because of the short-term maturity of the instruments. Our policy is to
transact with counterparties that are rated at least A� by Standard & Poor’s and A3 by Moody’s.
Some of our operations are located in countries that are rated below A� or A3. In this case, we try
to minimize our risk by holding cash and cash equivalents at financial institutions with which we

F-49


-----

**DIVERSEY BUSINESS**

**Notes to Combined Financial Statements (Continued)**

**Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Recently Issued and Adopted**
**Accounting Standards (Continued)**

have existing global relationships whenever possible, diversifying counterparty exposures and
minimizing the amount held by each counterparty and within the country in total.

_Trade Receivables, Net_

In the normal course of business, we extend credit to customers that satisfy pre-defined credit
criteria. Trade receivables, which are included on the Combined Balance Sheets, are net of
allowances for doubtful accounts. We maintain trade receivable allowances for estimated losses
resulting from the likelihood of failure of our customers to make required payments. An additional
allowance may be required if the financial condition of our customers deteriorate.

_Inventories_

We state inventories at the lower of cost or market; costs are determined using the FIFO
method. Costs related to inventories include raw materials, direct labor and manufacturing overhead
which are included in cost of sales on the Combined Statements of Operations.

_Property and Equipment, Net_

We state property and equipment at cost, except for the fair value of acquired property and
equipment and property and equipment that have been impaired, for which we reduce the carrying
amount to the estimated fair value at the impairment date. We capitalize significant improvements
and charge repairs and maintenance costs that do not extend the lives of the assets to expense as
incurred. We remove the cost and accumulated depreciation of assets sold or otherwise disposed
of from the accounts and recognize any resulting gain or loss upon the disposition of the assets.

We depreciate the cost of property and equipment over their estimated useful lives on a
straight-line basis as follows: buildings — 20 to 40 years; machinery and equipment — 5 to
10 years; and other property and equipment — 2 to 10 years.

_Free on Loan Equipment_

We have sales arrangements in which customer equipment, an inventory item, is provided to
customers for ‘‘free on loan’’ or at ‘‘no charge’’ on the condition that the customer purchases a
minimum amount of related consumables for use with the equipment. Providing equipment to
customers in this manner is part of a sales strategy that ensures the long-term and continued use
by the end customer of the Company’s consumable products (e.g. chemical cleaning solutions).
This practice is common in the markets the Company serves. Under these sales arrangements, the
Company assigns all revenue to the delivery of consumables and the equipment is amortized over
the equipment’s useful life or the life of the customer program, whichever is shorter.

_Asset Retirement Obligations_

The company records asset retirement obligations at fair value at the time the liability is
incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. Accretion expense is recognized as an
operating expense using the credit-adjusted risk-free interest rate in effect when the liability was
recognized. The associated asset retirement obligations are capitalized as part of the carrying

**Accounting Standards (Continued)**

amount of the long-lived asset and depreciated over the estimated remaining useful life of the
asset. The useful lives of property and equipment are discussed previously in the Property and
Equipment, net section.

_Goodwill and Identifiable Intangible Assets_

Goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate of the following (1) consideration transferred,
(2) the fair value of any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and, (3) if the business combination
is achieved in stages, the acquisition-date fair value of our previously held equity interest in the
acquiree over the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the
liabilities assumed.

Identifiable intangible assets consist primarily of patents, licenses, trademarks, trade names,
customer lists and relationships, non-compete agreements and technology based intangibles and
other contractual agreements. We amortize finite lived identifiable intangible assets over the shorter
of their stated or statutory duration or their estimated useful lives, generally ranging from 3 to
15 years, on a straight-line basis to their estimated residual values and periodically review them for
impairment. Total identifiable intangible assets comprise 15% and 16% in 2016 and 2015,
respectively, of our consolidated total assets.

We use the acquisition method of accounting for all business combinations and do not
amortize goodwill or intangible assets with indefinite useful lives. Goodwill and intangible assets
with indefinite useful lives are tested for possible impairment annually or more frequently if events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired.

_Long-Lived Assets_

_Impairment and Disposal of Long-Lived Assets_

For definite-lived intangible assets, such as customer relationships, contracts, intellectual
property, and for other long-lived assets, such as property and equipment, whenever impairment
indicators are present, we perform a review for impairment. We calculate the undiscounted value of
the projected cash flows associated with the asset, or asset group, and compare this estimated
amount to the carrying amount. If the carrying amount is found to be greater, we record an
impairment loss for the excess of book value over the fair value. In addition, in all cases of an
impairment review, we re-evaluate the remaining useful lives of the assets and modify them, as
appropriate.

For indefinite-lived intangible assets, such as trademarks and trade names, each year and
whenever impairment indicators are present, we determine the fair value of the asset and record an
impairment loss for the excess of book value over the fair value, if any. In addition, in all cases of
an impairment review we re-evaluate whether continuing to characterize the asset as indefinite-lived
is appropriate. See Note 7, ‘‘Goodwill and Identifiable Intangible Assets’’ of the Notes to Combined
Financial Statements for additional details.

_Self-Insurance_

The obligation for specified claims and losses related to property, casualty, workers’
compensation and employee benefit claims have been allocated to the Company from Sealed Air
based on headcount. We accrue for outstanding reported claims and claims that have been
incurred but not reported based upon management’s estimates of the aggregate liability for
retained losses using historical experience, insurance company estimates and the estimated trends
in claim values. Our estimates include management’s and independent insurance companies’
assumptions regarding economic conditions, the frequency and severity of claims and claim
development patterns and settlement practices. These estimates and assumptions are monitored
and evaluated on a periodic basis by management and are adjusted when warranted by changing
circumstances. Although management believes it has the ability to adequately project and record
estimated claim payments, actual results could differ significantly from the recorded liabilities.

_Pensions_

For a number of our international employees, we maintain defined benefit pension plans. We
are required to make assumptions regarding the valuation of projected benefit obligations and the
performance of plan assets for our defined benefit pension plans.

We review and approve the assumptions made by our third-party actuaries regarding the
valuation of benefit obligations and performance of plan assets. The principal assumptions concern
the discount rate used to measure future obligations, the expected future rate of return on plan
assets, the expected rate of future compensation increases and various other actuarial assumptions.
The measurement date used to determine benefit obligations and plan assets is December 31 for
all material plans (November 30 for non-material plans). In general, significant changes to these
assumptions could have a material impact on the costs and liabilities recorded in our Combined
Financial Statements.

See Note 14, ‘‘Profit Sharing, Retirement Savings Plans and Defined Benefit Pension Plans’’, of
the Notes to Combined Financial Statements for information about the Company’s benefit plans.

**_Recently Adopted Accounting Standards_**

In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (‘‘FASB’’) issued Accounting
Standards Updates (‘‘ASU’’) 2016-09, Compensation — Stock Compensation (Topic 718):
Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting (‘‘ASU 2016-09’’). ASU 2016-09
simplifies the accounting for share-based payment award transactions including: income tax
consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the
statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15,
2016, including interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted. The
Company elected to early adopt ASU 2016-09 in the third quarter of 2016 which required us to
reflect any adjustments as of January 1, 2016, the beginning of the annual period that includes the
interim period of adoption. The adoption had an immaterial impact on the Company’s Combined
Financial Statements.

**Accounting Standards (Continued)**

In November 2015, FASB issued ASU 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740), Balance Sheet
Classification of Deferred Taxes (‘‘ASU 2015-17’’). This ASU will simplify the presentation of deferred
tax assets and liabilities by requiring companies to classify all deferred tax as noncurrent on the
balance sheet instead of separating deferred taxes into current and noncurrent amounts.
ASU 2015-17 is effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after
December 31, 2016 and interim periods within those annual periods. However, as early adoption is
available, we adopted this standard as of December 31, 2015 with retrospective application.

In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-16, Business Combinations (Topic 805):
Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments (‘‘ASU 2015-16’’). This ASU
requires that an acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the
measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustments amounts are determined. The
ASU also requires that in the same period, the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation,
amortization or other income effects, if any, as a result of the change to the provisional amounts,
calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. The amendments in
ASU 2015-16 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, including interim
periods within those fiscal years and will be applied prospectively for adjustments to provisional
amounts that occur after that date. We have adopted this amendment as of January 1, 2016 on a
prospective basis as required and any adjustments to the provisional amounts identified during the
measurement period were immaterial.

In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-12, Plan Accounting: Defined Benefit Pension
Plans (Topic 960), Defined Contribution Pension Plans (Topic 962), Health and Welfare Benefit Plans
(Topic 965): (Part I) Fully Benefit-Responsive Investment Contracts, (Part II) Plan Investment
Disclosures, (Part III) Measurement Date Practical Expedient (‘‘ASU 2015-12’’). This ASU designates
contract value as the only required measure for fully benefit-responsive investment contracts;
simplifies the investment disclosure requirements under Accounting Standards Codification (‘‘ASC’’)
topic 820 for fair value, and topics 960, 962 and 965 for employee benefit plans; and provides a
similar measurement date practical expedient for employee benefit plans. The amendments in
ASU 2015-12 were effective as of January 1, 2016. ASU 2015-12 did not have a material impact on
our financial statements.

In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11, Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory
(‘‘ASU 2015-11’’), which applies to inventory valued at first-in, first-out (FIFO) or average cost.
ASU 2015-11 requires inventory to be measured at the lower of cost or net realizable value, rather
than at the lower of cost or market. ASU 2015-11 is effective on a prospective basis for annual
periods, including interim reporting periods within those periods, beginning after December 15,
2016. We have adopted this amendment as of January 1, 2017 and do not expect this to have a
material impact on our financial statements.

In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, Interest — Imputation of Interest
(Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs (‘‘ASU 2015-03’’). This ASU
simplifies the presentation of debt issuance costs. It requires that debt issuance costs related to a
recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying
amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. In August 2015, the FASB issued
ASU 2015-15, Interest — Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30), Presentation and Subsequent

arrangements were not specifically discussed in ASU 2015-03, the SEC staff would not object to an
entity deferring and presenting debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequently amortizing the
deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the line of credit arrangement, regardless of
whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement. ASU 2015-15
should be adopted concurrent with the adoption of ASU 2015-03. The amendments in ASU 2015-03
are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15,
2015. We have adopted these standards as of January 1, 2016 with retrospective application.

In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements — Going
Concern (Subtopic-205-40) (‘‘ASU 2014-15’’).This ASU requires management to evaluate whether it
is probable that known conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, would raise substantial
doubt about the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that
the financial statements are issued. If such conditions or events are identified, the standard requires
management’s mitigation plans to alleviate the doubt or a statement of the substantial doubt about
the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern to be disclosed in the financial statements. The
amendments in ASU 2014-15 are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years,
beginning after December 15, 2016. We adopted this amendment on December 31, 2016. The
adoption of ASU 2014-15 did not have a material impact on the financial statements

In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Intangibles — Goodwill and Other

value. The loss to be recognized cannot exceed the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting
unit. The amendments in ASU 2017-04 are effective for annual or interim goodwill impairment tests
in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted for interim and
annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017. We are
currently in the process of evaluating this new standard update.

In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-01, Business Combinations (Topic 805):
Clarifying the Definition of a Business (‘‘ASU 2017-01’’). ASU 2017-01 provides a screen to
determine when a set is not a business. This screen states that when substantially all of the fair
value of the group assets acquired (or disposed of) is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or
group of similar identifiable assets, the set is not a business. The amendments in ASU 2017-01 are
effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within
those periods. Early application is permitted for transactions for which the acquisition date occurs
before the issuance date or effective date of the amendments, only when the transaction has not
been reported in financial statements that have been issued. We are currently in the process of
evaluating this new standard update.

In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230):
Restricted Cash (‘‘ASU 2016-18’’). ASU 2016-18 requires that entities include restricted cash and
restricted cash equivalents with cash and cash equivalents in the beginning-of-period and
end-of-period total amounts shown on the Statement of Cash Flows. The amendments in
ASU 2016-18 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim
reporting periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption, including adoption in interim periods, is
permitted for all entities. Retrospective transition method is to be applied to each period presented.
We are currently in the process of evaluating this new standard update.

In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity
Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory (‘‘ASU 2016-16’’). ASU 2016-16 requires entities to
recognize income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when
the transfer occurs. The amendments in ASU 2016-16 are effective for annual reporting periods
beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within those annual
reporting periods. Early adoption is permitted for all entities as of the beginning of an annual
reporting period for which financial statements have not been issued or made available for
issuance. We are currently in the process of evaluating this new standard update.

In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230) —
Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (‘‘ASU 2016-15’’). ASU 2016-15
provides guidance on eight specific cash flow issues in regard to how cash receipts and cash
payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. The amendments in
ASU 2016-15 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim
periods within those years, with early adoption permitted. We are currently in the process of
evaluating this new standard update.

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments — Credit Losses
(Topic 326), Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (‘‘ASU 2016-13’’). ASU 2016-13
requires entities to measure all expected credit losses for most financial assets held at the reporting
date based on an expected loss model which includes historical experience, current conditions, and
reasonable and supportable forecasts. Entities will now use forward-looking information to better
form their credit loss estimates. The ASU also requires enhanced disclosures to help financial
statement users better understand significant estimates and judgments used in estimating credit
losses, as well as the credit quality and underwriting standards of an entity’s portfolio. ASU 2016-13
is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within
those fiscal periods. Entities may adopt earlier as of the fiscal year beginning after December 15,
2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We are currently in the process of
evaluating this new standard update.

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), (‘‘ASU 2016-02’’). This
ASU requires an entity to recognize a right-of-use asset and lease liability for all leases with terms
of more than 12 months. Recognition, measurement and presentation of expenses will depend on
classification as finance or operating lease. Similar modifications have been made to lessor
accounting in-line with revenue recognition guidance. The amendments also require certain
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about leasing arrangements. The amendments in
ASU 2016-02 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim

periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The updated guidance requires a
modified retrospective adoption. We are currently in the process of evaluating this new standard
update.

In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments — Overall
(Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities
(‘‘ASU 2016-01’’). This ASU requires equity investments except those under the equity method of
accounting to be measured at fair value with the changes in fair value recognized in net income.
The amendment simplifies the impairment assessment of equity investments without readily
determinable fair values by requiring a qualitative assessment to identify impairment. In addition, it
also requires enhanced disclosures about investments. The amendments in ASU 2016-01 are
effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those
fiscal years. Early application for certain provisions is allowed but early adoption of the
amendments is not permitted. An entity should apply the amendments by means of a cumulativeeffect adjustment to the balance sheet as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. We are
currently in the process of evaluating this new standard update.

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers
(Topic 606), (‘‘ASU 2014-09’’) and issued subsequent amendments to the initial guidance in August
2015, March 2016, April 2016 and May 2016 within ASU 2015-04, ASU 2016-08, ASU 2016-10 and
ASU 2016-12, respectively (ASU 2014-09, ASU 2015-04, ASU 2016-08, ASU 2016-10 and
ASU 2016-12 collectively, Topic 606). Previous revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP
comprised broad revenue recognition concepts together with numerous revenue requirements for
particular industries or transactions, which sometimes resulted in different accounting for
economically similar transactions. The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should
recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount
that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those
goods or services. In addition, ASU 2014-09 expands and enhances disclosure requirements which
require disclosing sufficient information to enable users of financial statements to understand the
nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with
customers. This includes both qualitative and quantitative information. The amendments in
ASU 2014-09 are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017,
including interim periods within that reporting period. Early application is not permitted. In August
2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral
of the Effective Date, (‘‘ASU 2015-14’’). The amendments in ASU 2015-14 delay the effective date of
ASU 2014-09 by one year to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and allow
early adoption as of the original public entity effective date. The amendments in ASU 2016-08,
ASU 2016-10 and ASU 2016-12 are effective in conjunction with ASU 2015-14.

The guidance permits two methods of adoption: full retrospective in which the standard is
applied to all of the periods presented or modified retrospective where an entity will have to
recognize the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard as an adjustment to the opening
balance of retained earnings. We currently anticipate adopting the modified retrospective method.

**Note 3 Acquisitions**

_Acquisition of Intellibot Robotics, LLC_

During the first quarter of 2015, we acquired the business of Intellibot Robotics LLC, a U.S.based privately owned company that has pioneered the development of robotic commercial floor
cleaning machines. The combination of Diversey Care’s industry expertise and global reach and
Intellibot’s artificial intelligence technology will help accelerate the development of the robotic floor
cleaning machines market — ultimately driving efficiencies and business value for the hygiene
industry.

The fair value of the consideration transferred was $17.9 million which included cash paid of
$8.5 million and $9.4 million related to the fair value of contingent consideration. We recorded the
fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed on the acquisition date, which included
$11.0 million of intangible assets. Goodwill of $6.6 million was recorded and 100% will be
deductible for tax purposes.

The contingent consideration, which is classified as a liability, includes an estimate of earnout
fees to be paid out in cash to the seller over a 10 year period based on various percentages of net
sales over the 10 year period. Since it is classified as a liability, we must remeasure to fair value
each reporting period. The fair value of the liability as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 was
$7.3 million and $9.8 million, respectively, primarily included in non-current liabilities on the
Combined Balance Sheet. The change due to fair value of $2.2 million in 2016 and $0.5 million in
2015 was recognized in selling, general and administrative expenses. The valuation of the
contingent consideration is based on a probability weighted projection of payments over the
applicable remaining period using the deterministic method. These projections are based on our
internal forecast of the business performance and since this is an unobservable input used in the
fair value measurement it would be considered a Level 3 input (as defined in Note 12, ‘‘Fair Value
Measurements and Other Financial Instruments’’). In addition, the probability weighted earnout
payments were present valued using factors to consider the risk associated with achievement of the
sales forecast and the credit risk associated with the payments.

_Other_

During the fourth quarter of 2015 the Company acquired Dry Lube Ltd. as part of Diversey
Europe and Dry Lube Inc. as part of Diversey North America. As of December 31, 2016 the total
purchase price was $7.8 million of which $6.7 million was allocated to goodwill. Additionally, during
the third quarter of 2016 the Company acquired Tampereen Teollsuuss¨ahk¨o Oy (‘‘TTS-Ciptec’’) as
part of Diversey Europe. The purchase price allocation had not been completed as of
December 31, 2016; as such $8.5 million of the purchase price has been preliminarily allocated to
goodwill.

**Note 4 Segments**

The Company’s segment reporting structure consists of five reportable segments and a
Corporate category and is as follows:

   - North America;

   - Europe;

**Notes to Combined Financial Statements (Continued)**

**Note 4 Segments (Continued)**

   - Middle East and Africa (‘‘MEA’’);

   - Latin America;

   - Asia Pacific; and

   - Corporate

The Company’s North America, Europe, MEA, Latin America and Asia Pacific segments are
considered reportable segments under FASB ASC Topic 280. Our reportable segments are aligned
with geographic regions. Corporate includes certain costs that are not allocated to the reportable
segments, as applicable, primarily consisting of unallocated corporate overhead costs, including
administrative functions and cost recovery variances not allocated to the reportable segments from
global functional expenses.

We allocate and disclose depreciation and amortization expense to our segments, although
property and equipment, net is not allocated to the segment assets, nor is depreciation and
amortization included in the segment performance metric Adjusted EBITDA. We also disclose
restructuring and other charges and impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets by
segment, although these items are not included in the segment performance metric Adjusted
EBITDA since restructuring and other charges and impairment of goodwill and other intangible
assets are categorized as Special Items as outlined in the table reconciling U.S. GAAP net income
to Non-U.S. GAAP Total Company Adjusted EBITDA set forth below. The accounting policies of the
reportable segments and Other are the same as those applied to the Combined Financial
Statements.

**Note 7 Goodwill and Identifiable Intangible Assets**

**_Goodwill_**

We review goodwill for impairment on a reporting unit basis annually during the fourth quarter
of each year, using a measurement date of October 1[st], and whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable. The Company first
assessed qualitative factors to determine whether it was more likely than not that the fair value of its

F-62


-----

**DIVERSEY BUSINESS**

**Notes to Combined Financial Statements (Continued)**

**Note 7 Goodwill and Identifiable Intangible Assets (Continued)**

single reporting unit was less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is
necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. The Company’s assessment is that the
two-step goodwill impairment test is not necessary for the years ending December 31, 2016 and
2015 for any of the Company’s regional reporting units. If the qualitative factors had indicated that it
was more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting units was less than its carrying amount,
the Company would have tested goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level using a two-step
approach.

The goodwill impairment test involves a two-step process. In step one, we compare the fair
value of each of our reporting units to its carrying value, including the goodwill allocated to the
reporting unit. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, there is no indication
of impairment and no further testing is required. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the
carrying value, we must perform step two of the impairment test to measure the amount of
impairment loss, if any. In step two, the reporting unit’s fair value is allocated to all of the assets
and liabilities of the reporting unit, including any unrecognized intangible assets, in a hypothetical
analysis that calculates the implied fair value of goodwill in the same manner as if the reporting unit
was being acquired in a business combination. If the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s
goodwill is less than the carrying value, the difference is recorded as an impairment loss.

As noted above, it was determined under a qualitative assessment that it was not more likely
than not that the fair value of any reporting unit was less than its carrying amount. Therefore, there
was no impairment of goodwill. However, if the fair value decreases in future periods, the Company

F-63

**DIVERSEY BUSINESS**

**Notes to Combined Financial Statements (Continued)**

**Note 7 Goodwill and Identifiable Intangible Assets (Continued)**

may fail step one of the goodwill impairment test and be required to perform step two. In
performing step two, the fair value would have to be allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of
the reporting unit. Therefore, any potential goodwill impairment charge would be dependent upon
the estimated fair value of the reporting unit at that time and the outcome of step two of the
impairment test. The fair values of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, including the
intangible assets could vary depending on various factors.

The future occurrence of a potential indicator of impairment, such as a decrease in expected
net income, adverse equity market conditions, a decline in current market multiples, a decline in
our common stock price, a significant adverse change in legal factors or business climates, an
adverse action or assessment by a regulator, unanticipated competition, strategic decisions made in
response to economic or competitive conditions, or a more-likely-than-not expectation that a
reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit will be sold or disposed of, could require an
interim assessment for some or all of the reporting units before the next required annual
assessment. In the event of significant adverse changes of the nature described above, we might
have to recognize a non-cash impairment of goodwill, which could have a material adverse effect
on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.

**_Credit Facility_**

_Amended and Restated Senior Secured Credit Facilities_

On July 25, 2014, the Parent Company entered into a second restatement agreement (the
‘‘Second Restatement Agreement’’) whereby its senior secured credit facility was amended and
restated (the ‘‘Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement’’) with Bank of America, N.A., as
agent, and the other financial institutions party thereto.

On August 29, 2014, we completed the $100 million delayed draw of the Term Loan A facility.
In connection with this loan, we also entered into interest rate and currency swaps in a notional
amount of $100 million, which convert our floating U.S. dollar-denominated obligation under the
Term Loan A into a fixed rate Brazilian real-denominated obligation. The first $20 million interest rate
and currency swap matured on September 30, 2016.

**Note 11 Derivatives and Hedging Activities**

We report all derivative instruments on our Combined Balance Sheets at fair value and
establish criteria for designation and effectiveness of transactions entered into for hedging
purposes.

As a large global organization, we face exposure to market risks, such as fluctuations in
foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. To manage the volatility relating to these
exposures, we enter into various derivative instruments from time to time under our risk
management policies. We designate derivative instruments as hedges on a transaction basis to
support hedge accounting. The changes in fair value of these hedging instruments offset in part or
in whole corresponding changes in the fair value or cash flows of the underlying exposures being
hedged. We assess the initial and ongoing effectiveness of our hedging relationships in accordance

F-68


-----

**DIVERSEY BUSINESS**

**Notes to Combined Financial Statements (Continued)**

**Note 11 Derivatives and Hedging Activities (Continued)**

with our policy. We do not purchase, hold or sell derivative financial instruments for trading
purposes. Our practice is to terminate derivative transactions if the underlying asset or liability
matures or is sold or terminated, or if we determine the underlying forecasted transaction is no
longer probable of occurring.

We record the fair value positions of all derivative financial instruments on a net basis by
counterparty for which a master netting arrangement is utilized.

**_Foreign Currency Forward Contracts Designated as Cash Flow Hedges_**

The primary purpose of our cash flow hedging activities is to manage the potential changes in
value associated with the amounts receivable or payable on equipment and raw material purchases
that are denominated in foreign currencies in order to minimize the impact of the changes in foreign
currencies. We record gains and losses on foreign currency forward contracts qualifying as cash
flow hedges in other comprehensive income to the extent that these hedges are effective and until
we recognize the underlying transactions in net income, at which time we recognize these gains
and losses in cost of sales on our Combined Statements of Operations. Cash flows from derivative
financial instruments are classified as cash flows from operating activities on the Combined
Statements of Cash Flows. These contracts generally have original maturities of less than
12 months.

Net unrealized after-tax gains (losses) related to these contracts that were included in other
comprehensive income were $1.1 million and $0.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2016
and 2015, respectively. The unrealized amounts in other comprehensive income will fluctuate based
on changes in the fair value of open contracts during each reporting period.

We estimate that $1.4 million of net unrealized derivative gains included in accumulated other
comprehensive income (AOCI) will be reclassified into earnings within the next twelve months.

**_Foreign Currency Forward Contracts Not Designated as Hedges_**

Our subsidiaries have foreign currency exchange exposure from buying and selling in
currencies other than their functional currencies. The primary purposes of our foreign currency
hedging activities are to manage the potential changes in value associated with the amounts
receivable or payable on transactions denominated in foreign currencies and to minimize the
impact of the changes in foreign currencies related to foreign currency-denominated interestbearing intercompany loans and receivables and payables. The changes in fair value of these
derivative contracts are recognized in other income, net, on our Combined Statements of
Operations and are largely offset by the remeasurement of the underlying foreign currencydenominated items indicated above. Cash flows from derivative financial instruments are classified
as cash flows from investing activities on the Combined Statements of Cash Flows. These contracts
generally have original maturities of less than 12 months.

**_Interest Rate Swaps_**

From time to time, we may use interest rate swaps to manage our mix of fixed and floating
interest rates on our outstanding indebtedness.

At December 31, 2016, and December 31, 2015, we had no outstanding interest rate swaps.

**DIVERSEY BUSINESS**

**Notes to Combined Financial Statements (Continued)**

**Note 11 Derivatives and Hedging Activities (Continued)**

**_Interest Rate and Currency Swaps_**

In 2014, in connection with exercising the $100 million delayed draw under the senior secured
credit facility, we entered into a series of interest rate and currency swaps in a notional amount of
$100 million. On September 30, 2016, the first $20.0 million swap contract matured and was settled.
As a result of the settlement, the Company received $4.9 million. These swaps convert the U.S.
dollar-denominated variable rate obligation under the credit facility into a fixed Brazilian
real-denominated obligation. The delayed draw and the interest rate and currency swaps are used
to fund expansion and general corporate purposes of our Brazilian subsidiaries.

**_Net Investment Hedge_**

During the second quarter of 2015, we entered into a series of foreign currency exchange
forwards totaling e270 million. These foreign currency exchange forwards hedged a portion of the
net investment in a certain European subsidiary against fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and
expired in June 2015. The loss of $3.5 million ($2.2 million after tax) is recorded in AOCI on our
Combined Balance Sheet.

In March 2015, we entered into a series of cross-currency swaps with a combined notional
amount of $425 million, hedging a portion of the net investment in a certain European subsidiary
against fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The fair value of this hedge as of December 31, 2016
was $(5.3) million ($(3.3) million after tax) on our Combined Balance Sheet.

For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedges of net investments in
foreign operations, settlements and changes in fair values of the derivative instruments are
recognized in unrealized net gains or loss on derivative instruments for net investment hedge, a
component of AOCI, net of taxes, to offset the changes in the values of the net investments being
hedged. Any portion of the net investment hedge that is determined to be ineffective is recorded in
other income, net on the Combined Statements of Operations

**_Other Derivative Instruments_**

We may use other derivative instruments from time to time to manage exposure to foreign
exchange rates and to access to international financing transactions. These instruments can
potentially limit foreign exchange exposure by swapping borrowings denominated in one currency
for borrowings denominated in another currency.

**_Fair Value of Derivative Instruments_**

See Note 12, ‘‘Fair Value Measurements and Other Financial Instruments’’, of the Notes to
Combined Financial Statements for a discussion of the inputs and valuation techniques used to
determine the fair value of our outstanding derivative instruments.

**_Cash Equivalents_**

Our cash equivalents consist of bank time deposits (Level 1). Since these are short-term
highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase,
they present negligible risk of changes in fair value due to changes in interest rates.

**_Compensating Balance Deposits_**

We have compensating balance deposits related to certain short-term borrowings. These
represent bank certificates of deposits that will mature within the next 3 months.

**_Derivative Financial Instruments_**

Our foreign currency forward contracts, foreign currency options, euro-denominated debt,
interest rate and currency swaps and cross-currency swaps are recorded at fair value on our
Combined Balance Sheets using a discounted cash flow analysis that incorporates observable
market inputs. These market inputs include foreign currency spot and forward rates, and various
interest rate curves, and are obtained from pricing data quoted by various banks, third party
sources and foreign currency dealers involving identical or comparable instruments (Level 2).

**Notes to Combined Financial Statements (Continued)**

**Note 12 Fair Value Measurements and Other Financial Instruments (Continued)**

Counterparties to these foreign currency forward contracts are rated at least BBB+ by
Standard & Poor’s and A3 by Moody’s. Credit ratings on some of our counterparties may change
during the term of our financial instruments. We closely monitor our counterparties’ credit ratings
and, if necessary, will make any appropriate changes to our financial instruments. The fair value
generally reflects the estimated amounts that we would receive or pay to terminate the contracts at
the reporting date.

**_Other Financial Instruments_**

The following financial instruments are recorded at fair value or at amounts that approximate
fair value: (1) trade receivables, net, (2) certain other current assets, (3) accounts payable and
(4) other current liabilities. The carrying amounts reported on our Combined Balance Sheets for the
above financial instruments closely approximate their fair value due to the short-term nature of these
assets and liabilities.

Other liabilities that are recorded at carrying value on our Combined Balance Sheets include
our senior notes. We utilize a market approach to calculate the fair value of our senior notes. Due
to their limited investor base and the face value of some of our senior notes, they may not be
actively traded on the date we calculate their fair value. Therefore, we may utilize prices and other
relevant information generated by market transactions involving similar securities, reflecting U.S.
Treasury yields to calculate the yield to maturity and the price on some of our senior notes. These
inputs are provided by an independent third party and are considered to be Level 2 inputs.

We derive our fair value estimates of our various other debt instruments by evaluating the
nature and terms of each instrument, considering prevailing economic and market conditions, and
examining the cost of similar debt offered at the balance sheet date. We also incorporated our
credit default swap rates and currency specific swap rates in the valuation of each debt instrument,
as applicable.

These estimates are subjective and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment,
and therefore we cannot determine them with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly
affect our estimates.

The table below shows the carrying amounts and estimated fair values of our total debt:

**Note 12 Fair Value Measurements and Other Financial Instruments (Continued)**

In addition to the table above, the Company remeasures amounts related to contingent
consideration liabilities related to acquisitions and certain equity compensation, that were carried at
fair value on a recurring basis in the Combined Financial Statements or for which a fair value
measurement was required. Refer to Note 3 ‘‘Acquisitions’’ of the Notes to Combined Financial
Statements for information regarding contingent consideration and Note 17 ‘‘Share-based
Compensation’’ of the Notes to Combined Financial Statements for share based compensation in
the Notes to Combined Financial Statements. Included among our non-financial assets and
liabilities that are not required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis are inventories, net
property and equipment, goodwill, intangible assets and asset retirement obligations.

**_Credit and Market Risk_**

Financial instruments, including derivatives, expose us to counterparty credit risk for
nonperformance and to market risk related to changes in interest or currency exchange rates. We
manage our exposure to counterparty credit risk through specific minimum credit standards,
establishing credit limits, diversification of counterparties, and procedures to monitor concentrations
of credit risk.

We do not expect any of our counterparties in derivative transactions to fail to perform as it is
our policy to have counterparties to these contracts that are rated at least BBB� or higher by
Standard & Poor’s and Baa3 or higher by Moody’s. Nevertheless, there is a risk that our exposure
to losses arising out of derivative contracts could be material if the counterparties to these
agreements fail to perform their obligations. We will replace counterparties if a credit downgrade is
deemed to increase our risk to unacceptable levels.

We regularly monitor the impact of market risk on the fair value and cash flows of our
derivative and other fmancial instruments considering reasonably possible changes in interest and
currency exchange rates and restrict the use of derivative financial instruments to hedging activities.
We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes and do not
use leveraged derivative financial instruments.

We continually monitor the creditworthiness of our diverse base of customers to which we
grant credit terms in the normal course of business and generally do not require collateral. We
consider the concentrations of credit risk associated with our trade accounts receivable to be
commercially reasonable and believe that such concentrations do not leave us vulnerable to
significant risks of near-term severe adverse impacts. The terms and conditions of our credit sales
are designed to mitigate concentrations of credit risk with any single customer. Our sales are not
materially dependent on a single customer or a small group of customers.

**Note 13 Profit Sharing, Retirement Savings Plans and Defined Benefit Pension Plans**

**_Profit Sharing and Retirement Savings Plans_**

We have a qualified non-contributory profit sharing plan covering most of our U.S. employees.
Contributions to this plan, which are made at the discretion of the Sealed Air Board of Directors,
may be made in cash, shares of common stock, or in a combination of cash and shares of
common stock. We also maintain qualified contributory retirement savings plans in which most of
our U.S. employees are eligible to participate. The qualified contributory retirement savings plans

F-75

**DIVERSEY BUSINESS**

**Notes to Combined Financial Statements (Continued)**

**Note 13 Profit Sharing, Retirement Savings Plans and Defined Benefit Pension Plans**
**(Continued)**

generally provide for contributions in cash based upon the amount contributed to the plans by the
participants.

Our contributions to our provisions for the profit sharing plan and retirement savings plans are
charged to operations and amounted to $5.8 million in 2016 and $7.5 million in 2015.

We have various international defined contribution benefit plans which cover certain
employees. We have expanded use of these plans in select countries where they have been used
to supplement or replace defined benefit plans.

**_Defined Benefit Pension Plans_**

We recognize the funded status of each defined pension benefit plan as the difference
between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligation of the employee benefit
plans in the Combined Balance Sheets, with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other
comprehensive loss, net of taxes. Each overfunded plan is recognized as an asset and each
underfunded plan is recognized as a liability on our Combined Balance Sheets. Subsequent
changes in the funded status are reflected on the Combined Balance Sheets in unrecognized
pension items, a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss, which is included in total
invested equity. The amount of unamortized pension items is recorded net of tax. The measurement
date used to determine the projected benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets is
December 31 for material plans and November 30 for non-material plans.

We have amortized actuarial gains or losses over the average future working lifetime (or
remaining lifetime of inactive participants if there are no active participants). We have used the
corridor method, where the corridor is the greater of ten percent of the projected benefit obligation
or fair value of assets at year end. If actuarial gains or losses do not exceed the corridor, then there
is no amortization of gain or loss.

The following table shows the components of our net periodic benefit cost for the two years
ended December 31, for our pension plans charged to operations:

_Plan Assets_

We review the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets annually, taking into
consideration our asset allocation, historical returns, and the current economic environment. The
expected return on plan assets is calculated based on the fair value of plan assets at year end. To
determine the expected return on plan assets, expected cash flows have been taken into account.

Our long-term objectives for plan investments are to ensure that (a) there is an adequate level
of assets to support benefit obligations to participants over the life of the plans, (b) there is
sufficient liquidity in plan assets to cover current benefit obligations, and (c) there is a high level of
investment return consistent with a prudent level of investment risk. The investment strategy is
focused on a long-term total return in excess of a pure fixed income strategy with short-term
volatility less than that of a pure equity strategy. To accomplish this objective, we invest assets
primarily in a diversified mix of equity and fixed income investments. For U.S. plans, the target asset
allocation will typically be 40-50% in equity securities, with a maximum equity allocation of 70%,
and 50-60% in fixed income securities, with a minimum fixed income allocation of 30% including
cash.

The fair values of our U.S. and international pension plan assets, by asset category and by the
level of fair values are as follows:

principal preservation and daily liquidity as its primary objectives. Investments are primarily comprised of certificates of
deposit, government securities, commercial paper, and time deposits.

(2) Fixed income funds that invest in a diversified portfolio primarily consisting of publicly traded government bonds and
corporate bonds. There are no restrictions on these investments, and they are valued at the net asset value of shares
held at year end.

**Note 14 Other Post-Employment Benefits and Other Employee Benefit Plans**

In addition to providing pension benefits, we provide for a portion of healthcare, dental, vision
and life insurance benefits for certain retired Diversey employees, primarily in North America.
Covered employees retiring on or after attaining age 55 and who have rendered at least ten years
of service are entitled to post-retirement healthcare, dental and life insurance benefits. These
benefits are subject to deductibles, co-payment provisions and other limitations.

Contributions made by us, net of Medicare Part D subsidies received in the U.S., are reported

_Healthcare Cost Trend Rates_

For the year ended December 31, 2016, healthcare cost trend rates were assumed to be 4.0%
for the Belgian plan, 7.0% for the U.S. plan in 2016 and decreasing to 5.0% by 2022, and 5.5% for
the Canada plan in 2016 decreasing to 5.0% by 2018. The assumed healthcare cost trend rate has
an effect on the amounts reported for the healthcare plans. A one percentage point change on
assumed healthcare cost trend rates would have the following effect for the year ended
December 31, 2016:

We have concluded that it is more likely than not that we will not realize the majority of our
U.S. deferred tax assets at December 31, 2016. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we
estimate future reversals of existing temporary differences, future taxable earnings, tax planning
strategies and taxable income in carryback periods to determine which deferred tax assets are
more likely than not to be realized in the future.

**DIVERSEY BUSINESS**

**Notes to Combined Financial Statements (Continued)**

**Note 15 Income Taxes (Continued)**

A valuation allowance has been provided based on the likelihood of realizing the tax benefits
primarily related to the following deferred tax assets:

   - $134.7 million of foreign tax credit carryovers;

   - $102.7 million of federal and foreign net operating losses and future deductible items; and

   - $20.1 million of state net operating losses, credits and future deductible items.

For the year ended December 31, 2016, the valuation allowance increased by $72.7 million.
This increase includes the impact of a reduction of a future source of taxable income from foreign
earnings and continuing US losses. As of December 31, 2016, we have foreign net operating loss
carry forwards of $156.0 million expiring in years beginning in 2017. The Federal net operating loss
carryovers generated by the Company of $123.5 million begin to expire in 2024. The state net
operating loss carry forwards totaling $138.1 million expire in various amounts over one to 20 years.
Net operating losses presented herein may not represent amounts available for utilization in future
tax returns due to allocation methods applied in these financial statements.

As of December 31, 2016, we have foreign and federal tax credit carry forwards totaling
$141.2 million that expire in calendar year 2017 through 2036. We have $4.6 million of state credit
carryovers expiring in 2017 - 2036. We have provided a full valuation allowance on all of the U.S.
credits.

The Company has provided a $28.2 million deferred tax liability for unremitted foreign
earnings; no offset for foreign tax credits related to these earnings is recorded. The liability relates
to approximately $377.0 million of our foreign subsidiaries’ accumulated earnings that the Company
plans to repatriate.

The Company has not recorded a deferred tax liability related to the federal and state income
taxes and foreign withholding taxes on approximately $1.4 billion of undistributed earnings of
certain foreign subsidiaries indefinitely reinvested. Upon repatriation of those earnings the Company
could be subject to both U.S. income taxes and withholding taxes payable to the various foreign
countries.

A reconciliation of the provision for income taxes, with the amount computed by applying the

**_Unrecognized Tax Benefits_**

Our unrecognized tax benefits and the effect on our effective income tax rate if recognized
(in millions) is as follows:

Year Ended
December 31,
2016 2015

Beginning balance of unrecognized tax benefits . . . . . . . . . . . . $109.6 $171.9
Additions for tax positions of current year . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2.3 1.8

Reductions for tax positions of prior years . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (22.1) (6.6)
Reductions for lapses of statutes of limitation . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (39.6) (57.6)

Ending balance of unrecognized tax benefits . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 50.2 $109.6

In 2016, our unrecognized tax benefit decreased by $59.4 million, primarily related to the
expiration of the statute of limitations and settlement of audits. In 2015, we decreased our
unrecognized tax benefit by $62.3 million primarily related to a reserve for which the statute of
limitations has expired and which was primarily recorded at the time of the Diversey Holdings, Inc.
acquisition.

If the unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2016 were recognized, our income tax
expense would decrease by $48.4 million, resulting in a substantially lower effective tax rate. Based
on the potential outcome of the Company’s global tax examinations and the expiration of the
statute of limitations for specific jurisdictions, it is reasonably possible that the unrecognized tax
benefits will change within the next 12 months. The associated impact on the reserve balance is
estimated to be a decrease in the range of zero to $8.1 million.

**Notes to Combined Financial Statements (Continued)**

**Note 15 Income Taxes (Continued)**

We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax
provision in the Combined Statements of Operations. We had a liability of approximately of
$17.9 million (of which $5.7 million represents penalties) at December 31, 2016 for the payment of
interest and penalties (before any tax benefit), and a liability of $20.1 million (of which $6.6 million
represents penalties) at December 31, 2015. In 2016, there was a $2.2 million decrease in interest
and penalties in the tax accruals for uncertainties in prior years. In 2015, there was a $2.3 million
decrease in interest and penalties in the tax accruals for uncertainties in prior years.

The table above discloses the amounts of unrecognized tax benefits that were included in tax
returns filed by the Company either as a separate filer or as part of Sealed Air. Historically, a portion
of the Company’s operations have been included in tax returns filed by Sealed Air or its
subsidiaries. As a result, some uncertain tax positions related to the Company’s operations result in
unrecognized tax benefits that are potential obligations of Sealed Air or its subsidiaries.

**_Income Tax Returns_**

The Company files U.S. federal income tax returns as well as income tax returns in various
state and foreign jurisdictions both as a separate filer or as part of Sealed Air. Unrecognized tax
benefits relate to income tax returns for tax years that remain subject to examination by the relevant
tax authorities. Since the Company’s operations have historically been included in federal and state
returns filed by Sealed Air, the statements surrounding examinations may relate to historical Sealed
Air returns. We are under examination by the IRS (as part of the Sealed Air consolidation) for the
2012-2014 tax years.

State income tax returns are generally subject to examination for a period of three to five years
after their filing date. We have various state income tax returns in the process of examination, and
are open to examination for periods after 2002.

Our foreign income tax returns are under examination in various jurisdictions in which we
conduct business. Income tax returns in foreign jurisdictions have statutes of limitations generally
ranging from three to five years after their filing date and except where still under examination or
where we are litigating, we have generally concluded all other income tax matters globally for years
through 2007.

Management believes that an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that
may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with
certainty. If any issues addressed in the Company’s tax audits are resolved in a manner not
consistent with management’s expectations, the Company could be required to adjust its provision
for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs.

**Note 16 Commitments and Contingencies**

**_Environmental Matters_**

We are subject to loss contingencies resulting from environmental laws and regulations, and
we accrue for anticipated costs associated with investigatory and remediation efforts when an
assessment has indicated that a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. These accruals
are not reduced by potential insurance recoveries, if any. We do not believe that it is reasonably
possible that our liability in excess of the amounts that we have accrued for environmental matters

F-89


-----

**DIVERSEY BUSINESS**

**Notes to Combined Financial Statements (Continued)**

**Note 16 Commitments and Contingencies (Continued)**

will be material to our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. Environmental
liabilities are reassessed whenever circumstances become better defined or remediation efforts and
their costs can be better estimated.

We evaluate these liabilities periodically based on available information, including the progress
of remedial investigations at each site, the current status of discussions with regulatory authorities
regarding the methods and extent of remediation and the apportionment of costs among potentially
responsible parties. As some of these issues are decided (the outcomes of which are subject to
uncertainties) or new sites are assessed and costs can be reasonably estimated, we adjust the
recorded accruals, as necessary. We believe that these exposures are not material to our
consolidated financial condition or results of operations. We believe that we have adequately
reserved for all probable and estimable environmental exposures.

**_Guarantees and Indemnification Obligations_**

We are a party to many contracts containing guarantees and indemnification obligations.
These contracts primarily consist of:

   - product warranties with respect to certain products sold to customers in the ordinary course
of business. These warranties typically provide that products will conform to specifications.
We generally do not establish a liability for product warranty based on a percentage of sales
or other formula. We accrue a warranty liability on a transaction-specific basis depending on
the individual facts and circumstances related to each sale. Both the liability and annual
expense related to product warranties are immaterial to our consolidated financial position
and results of operations; and

   - intellectual property warranties by us to third parties in which we have agreed to indemnify
the licensee such third parties against infringement claims.

We are also involved in various other legal actions incidental to our business. We believe, after
consulting with counsel, that the disposition of these other legal proceedings and matters will not
have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.

**_Other Principal Contractual Obligations_**

At December 31, 2016, we had other principal contractual obligations, which included
agreements to purchase an estimated amount of goods, including raw materials, or services in the
normal course of business, aggregating to approximately $36.9 million. The estimated future cash
outlays are as follows:

_Asset Retirement Obligations_

The Company has recorded asset retirement obligations primarily associated with asbestos
abatement, lease restitution and the removal of underground tanks. The Company’s asset
retirement obligation liabilities were $3.5 million and $4.1 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015.
The Company also recorded assets within property and equipment, net which included $0.7 million
and $0.6 million related to buildings and $2.9 million and $3.5 million related to leasehold
improvements as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. For the year ended December 31,
2016 accretion expense was $0.6 million.

**_Leases_**

We are obligated under the terms of various leases covering primarily warehouse and office
facilities and production equipment, as well as smaller manufacturing sites that we occupy. We
account for the majority of our leases as operating leases, which may include purchase or renewal
options. At December 31, 2016, estimated future minimum annual rental commitments under
non-cancelable real and personal property leases were as follows:

**Note 17 Share-Based Compensation**

Sealed Air has a combined incentive plan in which the Company participates. The plan
provides for the grant of Sealed Air stock options, Sealed Air stock appreciation rights, Sealed Air
restricted stock, Sealed Air restricted stock units, Sealed Air unrestricted stock, Sealed Air
performance share units known as PSU awards, other stock awards and cash awards to officers
and key employees.

We record share-based incentive compensation expense in selling, general and administrative
expenses and cost of sales on our Combined Statements of Operations for both equity-classified
awards and liability-classified awards. We record corresponding credit to current or non-current
liability for liability-classified awards based on the fair value of the share-based incentive
compensation awards at the date of grant. Total expense for the liability-classified awards continues
to be remeasured to fair value at the end of each reporting period. We recognize an expense or
credit reflecting the straight-line recognition, net of estimated forfeitures, of the expected cost of the
program. The number of PSUs earned may equal, exceed or be less than the targeted number of
shares depending on whether the performance criteria are met, surpassed or not met.
