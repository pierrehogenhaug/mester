As part of the Offering of the Floating Rate Senior Secured Notes, the Issuer is issuing Floating Rate Senior Secured Notes (such Floating Rate
Senior Secured Notes are referred to herein as ‘‘Exchange Notes’’) to eligible holders of the Issuer’s A390,000,000 Floating Rate Senior Secured
Notes due 2018 pursuant to an exchange offer (the ‘‘Exchange Offer’’), which is expected to settle on the Issue Date. The combined aggregate
principal amount of the Floating Rate Senior Secured Notes (including the Exchange Notes to be issued pursuant to the Exchange Offer) and the
Fixed Rate Senior Secured Notes is A600,000,000. Of the A225,000,000 aggregate principal amount of Floating Rate Senior Secured Notes being
offered by the Issuer, an aggregate principal amount of A100,001,000 will be issued pursuant to the Exchange Offer while an aggregate principal
amount of A124,999,000 will be issued for cash pursuant to the Offering of the Floating Rate Senior Secured Notes. The Floating Rate Senior
Secured Notes offered hereby and the Exchange Notes will comprise one series of Floating Rate Senior Secured Notes. Completion of the
Offerings is not conditional upon completion of the Exchange Offer.

Interest on the Floating Rate Senior Secured Notes will be equal to three-month EURIBOR (subject to a floor of 0%) plus 637.5 basis
points, reset quarterly, and will be paid quarterly in arrears on February 1, May 1, August 1 and November 1 of each year, beginning on

beginning on February 1, 2017.

The Issuer may redeem the Floating Rate Senior Secured Notes in whole or in part at any time on or after August 1, 2017 at the redemption
prices specified herein. Prior to August 1, 2017, the Issuer may redeem all or part of the Floating Rate Senior Secured Notes at a redemption price
equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, plus the applicable ‘‘make whole’’
premium, as described herein.

The Issuer may redeem the Fixed Rate Senior Secured Notes in whole or in part at any time on or after August 1, 2019 at the redemption
prices specified herein. Prior to August 1, 2019, the Issuer may redeem all or part of the Fixed Rate Senior Secured Notes at a redemption price

Senior Secured Notes with the net proceeds from certain equity offerings at the redemption price set forth in this offering memorandum (the
‘‘Offering Memorandum’’).

The Issuer may redeem all, but not less than all, of the Notes upon the occurrence of certain changes in applicable tax law. Upon the
occurrence of certain events constituting a change of control, the Issuer may be required to make an offer to repurchase all of the Notes at a
redemption price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any. However, a
change of control will not be deemed to have occurred if a certain net leverage ratio is not exceeded in connection with such an event.

The Notes will be the Issuer’s senior obligations and will be guaranteed (the ‘‘Guarantees’’ and each a ‘‘Guarantee’’) on a senior secured
basis by the guarantors named herein (the ‘‘Guarantors’’). The Notes and the Guarantees will be secured by first-ranking security interests (together
with the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ obligations under the New Revolving Credit Facility (as defined herein)) in certain assets of the Issuer and
certain subsidiaries of the Issuer, including shares of Guarantors, as described in greater detail herein. The laws of certain jurisdictions limit the
enforceability of Guarantees and the rights to the Collateral (as defined herein) securing such Guarantees. In the event of enforcement of the
Collateral, the holders of the Notes will receive proceeds from the Collateral only after the lenders under the New Revolving Credit Facility and
certain hedging obligations have been repaid in full. See ‘‘Description of the Notes—Credit enhancement—Security.’’

Application has been made to list the Notes on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and to admit the Notes to trading on
the Luxembourg Stock Exchange’s Euro MTF market. The Euro MTF market is not a regulated market pursuant to the provisions of

**SHOULD READ BEFORE YOU MAKE ANY DECISION WITH RESPECT TO AN INVESTMENT IN**
**THE NOTES.**

**INFORMATION REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS**

This Offering Memorandum includes ‘‘forward-looking statements’’ within the meaning of the
securities laws of certain jurisdictions. These forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of
forward-looking terminology, including the terms ‘‘believe,’’ ‘‘estimate,’’ ‘‘anticipate,’’ ‘‘expect,’’
‘‘intend,’’ ‘‘may,’’ ‘‘will’’ or ‘‘should’’ or, in each case, their negative, or other variations or comparable

terminology. These forward-looking statements include all matters that are not historical facts. They
appear in a number of places throughout this Offering Memorandum and include statements regarding
our intentions, beliefs or current expectations concerning, among other things, our results of operations,
financial condition, liquidity, prospects, growth, strategies and the industry in which we operate and
predictions and forecasts of industry experts upon which we rely.

By their nature, forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties
because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in the future.
Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and our actual results of
operations, financial condition and liquidity, and the development of the industry in which we operate,
may differ materially from those made in or suggested by the forward-looking statements contained in
this Offering Memorandum. You should not place undue reliance on these forward looking statements.
In addition, even if our actual results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and the
development of the industry in which we operate, are consistent with the forward-looking statements
contained in this Offering Memorandum, those results or developments may not be indicative of results
or developments in subsequent periods. In particular, you should place no reliance on statements we
make with respect to estimates, expectations or projections regarding sales volume or synergies
expected from acquisitions we have made or may undertake. Important factors that could cause those
differences include, but are not limited to:

  - difficulty to accurately forecast customer demand;

  - industry conditions, including cyclicality in the prices of our products and the raw materials
used to make them, competition and production capacity;

  - global economic conditions and political events;

  - the United Kingdom’s recent referendum on membership in the European Union and the
results of implementing that referendum;

  - changing customer preferences or the development of new technologies;

  - substitution towards digital media and changes in consumer preferences;

  - the highly competitive nature of our industry;

  - our reliance on a limited number of customer accounts for a significant amount of our
revenue;

  - our ability to generate sufficient cash to satisfy our commitments and fund our capital
expenditures;

  - risks related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates;

  - risks related to current and future acquisitions;

  - our ability to realize cost reductions and efficiency improvements;

  - the cost of compliance with environmental health and safety and other laws and regulations;

  - changes in energy regulation;

  - costs and liability associated with hazardous substances at certain of our facilities;

  - effects of climate change;

  - the possibility of major disruptions in production at our facilities, including risks associated
with our labor relations;

  - changes in regulation of pension liabilities and other employment obligations;

  - the supervision of public administrative authorities;

  - our limited insurance coverage;

  - a fire or other accident at our facilities;

  - certifications by industry standard-setting bodies;

  - our ability to retain key employees;

v


-----

  - other risks and uncertainties inherent to our business and to general local and global
economic conditions;

  - the consequences of our substantial indebtedness;

  - risks related to the Collateral;

  - risks related to our structure; and

  - other factors discussed under ‘‘Risk Factors’’, ‘‘Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of
the Guarantees and the Security Interests’’ and elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

These risks and others described under ‘‘Risk Factors’’ are not exhaustive. Other sections of this
Offering Memorandum describe additional factors that could adversely affect our results of operations,
financial condition, liquidity and the development of the sectors in which we operate. New risks can
emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all such risks, nor can we assess the
impact of all such risks on our business or the extent to which any risks, or combination of risks and
other factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking
statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, you should not rely on forward-looking statements as a
prediction of actual results.

We undertake no obligation to publicly update or publicly revise any forward-looking statement,
whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. All subsequent written and oral
forward-looking statements attributable to us or to persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified
in their entirety by the cautionary statements referred to above and contained elsewhere in this
Offering Memorandum.

**PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION**

Unless otherwise indicated, financial information in this Offering Memorandum is presented in
euro and has been prepared in accordance with IFRS-EU.

-----

This Offering Memorandum includes (i) audited consolidated financial information of the Issuer as
of and for the years ended December 31, 2013, December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2015 and
accompanying notes, prepared in accordance with IFRS-EU (the ‘‘Audited Consolidated Financial
Information’’); and (ii) interim condensed consolidated financial information of the Issuer as of and for
the three months ended March 31, 2016 and the comparative period as of and for the three months
ended March 31, 2015 and accompanying notes, prepared in accordance with IFRS-EU (the ‘‘Interim
Condensed Consolidated Financial Information’’). The financial information included in this Offering
Memorandum is not intended to comply with the SEC reporting requirements. Compliance with such
requirements would require the presentation of financial information in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the U.S. (‘‘U.S. GAAP’’) or in accordance with International Financial
Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (‘‘IFRS-IASB’’), as the
case may be, the modification or exclusion of certain information presented in this Offering
Memorandum and the presentation of certain other information not included in this Offering
Memorandum including pro forma financial information for a material disposition. In addition,
IFRS-EU, IFRS-IASB and U.S. GAAP may differ in certain significant respects from each other. This
Offering Memorandum does not include any reconciliation of the Audited Consolidated Financial
Statements or the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Information from IFRS-EU to
IFRS-IASB or U.S. GAAP. It is possible that a reconciliation or other qualitative or quantitative
analysis would identify material differences between the financial information presented herein in
accordance with IFRS-EU and other financial information prepared under IFRS-IASB or U.S. GAAP.
Prospective investors should consult their own accounting advisors for an understanding of the
differences between IFRS-EU, IFRS-IASB and U.S. GAAP and how those differences might affect the
financial information and other data presented in this Offering Memorandum.

Some financial information and other numerical data in this Offering Memorandum have been
rounded and, as a result, the numerical figures shown as totals in this Offering Memorandum may vary
slightly from the exact arithmetic aggregation of the figures that precede them.

We have included in this Offering Memorandum non-GAAP financial measures called EBITDA
and Adjusted EBITDA. We define ‘‘EBITDA’’ as earnings before depreciation, amortization,
non-recurring items, finance costs, net income from associates and income tax. EBITDA includes
non-cash expenses and income, consisting of variations of inventories and operating provisions.
EBITDA as presented herein and in our financial statements is not calculated in the same way as
EBITDA is calculated under the Indentures and the New Revolving Credit Facility.

We are not presenting EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as measures of our results of operations.
We believe that the presentation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA enhances an investor’s
understanding of our operating performance and our ability to service our debt. In addition, we believe
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are measures commonly used by investors. EBITDA and Adjusted
EBITDA are not measurements of financial performance under U.S. GAAP and should not be
considered as an alternative to other indicators of our operating performance, cash flows or any other
measure of performance derived in accordance with GAAP. In addition, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA
and similar measures are used by different companies for differing purposes and are often calculated in
ways that reflect the circumstances of those companies. You should exercise caution in comparing
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as reported by us to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA of other
companies. EBITDA as presented here differs from the definition of ‘‘Consolidated EBITDA’’
contained in the Indenture. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have important limitations as analytical
tools, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results of
operations as reported under U.S. GAAP. For example, EBITDA-based measures:

  - do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures;

  - do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;

  - do not reflect the interest expense or cash requirements necessary to service interest or
principal payments on our debt;

  - do not reflect any cash income taxes that we may be required to pay;

  - are not adjusted for all non-cash income or expense items that are reflected in our
consolidated income statement; and

ix


-----

  - do not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from certain matters we consider not
to be indicative of our ongoing operations.

Because of these limitations, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as a
measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or as a measure of
cash that will be available to us to meet our obligations. You should compensate for these limitations
by relying primarily on our IFRS-EU results and using EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA only
supplementally to evaluate our performance. You are encouraged to evaluate each of the adjustments
reflected in our presentation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA and whether you consider each to be
appropriate. See ‘‘Summary—Summary Consolidated Financial Information and Other Data,’’ ‘‘Selected
Consolidated Financial Information and Other Data,’’ ‘‘Operating and Financial Review and Prospects’’
and our Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Offering
Memorandum.

This Offering Memorandum also includes the unaudited condensed consolidated financial
information as of and for the twelve months ended March 31, 2016 for the Issuer. Our financial
information as of and for the twelve months ended March 31, 2016 was derived by aggregating without
adjustments the relevant results of the year ended December 31, 2015 and the three months ended
March 31, 2016 and subtracting the relevant results of the three months ended March 31, 2015. Our
financial information as of and for the twelve months ended March 31, 2016 has been prepared for
illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily representative of our results of operations for any
future period or our financial condition at any future date. The unaudited condensed consolidated
financial information for the twelve months ended March 31, 2016 presented herein is not required by
or presented in accordance with IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting principles.

**EXCHANGE RATE INFORMATION**

The following table sets forth, for the periods set forth below, the high, low, average and period
end Bloomberg Composite Rate expressed as U.S. dollars per A1.00. The Bloomberg Composite Rate is
a ‘‘best market’’ calculation, in which, at any point in time, the bid rate is equal to the highest bid rate
of all contributing bank indications and the ask rate is set to the lowest ask rate offered by these banks.
The Bloomberg Composite Rate is a mid-value rate between the applied highest bid rate and the
lowest ask rate. The rates may differ from the actual rates used in the preparation of the consolidated
financial statements and other financial information appearing in this Offering Memorandum. Neither
Lecta S.A. nor the Initial Purchasers represent that the U.S. dollar amounts referred to below could be
or could have been converted into euro at any particular rate indicated or any other rate.

The average rate for a year means the average of the Bloomberg Composite Rates on the last day
of each month during a year. The average rate for a month, or for any shorter period, means the
average of the daily Bloomberg Composite Rates during that month, or shorter period, as the case may
be.

The Bloomberg Composite Rate of the euro on July 22, 2016 was $1.0967 per A1.00.

**SUMMARY**

_The following summary supplements, and should be read in conjunction with, the more detailed_
_information contained elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. You should read the entire Offering_
_Memorandum carefully to understand our business, the nature of the Notes offered hereby, and the tax and_
_other considerations that are important to your decision to invest in the Notes. You should pay special_
_attention to the ‘‘Risk Factors’’ section._

**Our Company**

We are one of the leading European manufacturers and distributors of specialty papers for labels
and flexible packaging, premium coated paper for wide format advertising, high quality publishing and
commercial printing, along with other high value-added paper products. We have an annual production
capacity of 258,000 metric tons of labels and flexible packaging and 231,000 metric tons of UWF and
base paper. We are also the largest CWF manufacturer in Southern Europe, with an annual production
capacity of 1,135,000 metric tons in 2015. We own and operate a 234,000 metric ton pulp mill in Spain,
which provides approximately 30% of our overall pulp requirements. We have ten paper machines in
seven mills located at various sites in Italy, France and Spain. In the twelve months ended March 31,
2016, our mills produced an aggregate of 298,000 metric tons of specialty papers and UWF and
1,142,000 metric tons of CWF.

In addition, we operate a substantial paper distribution business that we have built organically and
through the acquisitions of Malmenayde in France in 2008 and Polyedra in Italy in 2012. In the twelve
months ended March 31, 2016, we distributed 535,000 metric tons of paper, of which 134,000 metric
tons were produced by third parties. We plan to expand our distribution business with selected and
opportunistic bolt-on acquisitions to expand our presence in other countries.

For CWF, we rank first in terms of market share in France and Spain, and second in Italy, the
principal markets for our products, which accounted for 17%, 13% and 16%, respectively, of our paper
deliveries by volume in 2015. We also market our CWF elsewhere in Europe, including
Germany (13%), the United Kingdom (8%) and other Western European countries (9%), Eastern
Europe (4%), and, to a lesser extent, outside of Europe. Our mills are located in close proximity to the
key commercial markets in Western Europe. These markets account for approximately 70% of demand
for CWF in Europe and approximately 75% of our total sales in 2015.

During the twelve months ended March 31, 2016, our revenue (consisting of sales of paper and
energy) were A1,474.3 million. During the same period we had Adjusted EBITDA of A119.6 million and
an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 8.1%.

We were formed by CVC Capital Partners (‘‘CVC’’) in 1997 through the acquisition of Cartiere
del Garda of Italy in October of that year, and we subsequently acquired Condat of France in
November 1998 and Torraspapel of Spain in December 1999, all three of which are long-established
paper manufacturing companies.

-----

We have a high-quality asset base, which achieves superior operating performance. Between 1999
and 2015, we invested approximately A1.0 billion in rebuilding our papermaking, coating and converting
machines, increasing our co-generation capabilities, reducing costs, improving productivity, enhancing
our information technology, implementing environmental and safety improvements and maintenance.
We have reduced both our variable and fixed costs through machine modernization and various cost
reduction initiatives, including the coordination of sales and marketing, and raw material purchases,
and extensive internal and external benchmarking of our production processes. Additionally, we have
invested in efficient energy production activities and reduction in greenhouse-gas emissions, and
currently benefit from six co-generation plants with total installed capacity of 271 MW.

**Our Strengths**

We believe we have a number of competitive advantages, including:

**_Focus on Specialties and Other Higher Margin Products with Growing Demand._** We are successfully
shifting our product mix, thanks to the significant investments we have made towards increasing
capacity in higher margin products, such as value added specialty papers as well as sheeted CWF and
CWF in premium grades and heavier weights, and are focusing our marketing and distribution efforts
on customers who require these products.

In specialty papers, the focus of our investments has been on shifting our product mix toward
self-adhesive (e.g., labels and flexible packaging), metalized (e.g., labels for beer and spirit bottles),
1-side coated (e.g., premium shopping bags) and thermal (e.g., point-of-sale receipts) papers, all of
which have been experiencing, and which we expect will continue to experience, growing demand due
to the diversified range of day-to-day commercial applications of these papers. We have been successful
in growing our sales in these key focus products at above market rates in 2015. We are particularly
focused on wet-strength labels, top-coated thermal labels, betting applications and travel and admissions
tickets. In addition, we have significant experience in homologation of new self-adhesive, metalized and
1-side coated products. Our know-how of coating technologies and base papers production position us
well to develop new products for labelling and flexible packaging and provide a strong platform for
expanding our product offerings into new industries. Our close proximity to European commercial
printing markets, labels and flexible packaging customers and dedication to customer service enable us
to shift our product mix in response to growth trends.

From 2013 through 2015, we increased our deliveries of self-adhesive, metalized, 1-side coated and
thermal papers by 27%.

We believe that our CWF product mix is more heavily weighted towards higher margin sheets as
compared to our competitors. The charts below show our focus on sheeted paper versus reels and the
breakdown of our specialty paper production.

We are pursuing increased sales to our existing customers as well as to new customers, in
particular printers, publishers and paper distributors. We seek to drive product performance
improvements in the CWF segment by developing new products that meet the needs of our customers.

**_Strong Market Positions in the Markets in which We Operate._** We are the market leader for CWF in
our target markets in Spain, France and Portugal, number two in Italy, and enjoy strong positions in

The majority of our products are sold under the Lecta trademark and their own local product
brand names (Creator, Garda Cartiere and Condat), which we believe have strong recognition among
our target customers in Spain, France, Italy and Portugal. We engage in a variety of targeted
promotional activities and advertising to enhance the recognition of our brands, as we believe that this
helps to differentiate our products.

**_Customer Connectivity via Our Owned Distribution Platform._** In addition to our production activities,
we operate a paper distribution business serving over 20,000 customers, distributing both our own CWF
and specialty papers and those produced by third parties. Our integrated distribution business,
combined with our Internet-based ordering platform, has allowed us to simplify ordering, tracking and
invoicing, and is part of our strategy to continually reduce the logistics costs in our value chain. In
addition, we operate an information system designed for collaborative production planning,
procurement and inventory management processes throughout the supply chain.

Our distribution group is a leader in Southern Europe, with the leading distribution market
position in Spain and the second highest positions in France, Italy and Portugal. Overall, we believe we
are the sixth largest European paper distribution group with sales volume of 535,000 metric tons for
the twelve months ended March 31, 2016, including 134,000 metric tons of third party products. We
currently sell our products through our distribution business in France, Italy Spain and Portugal. Our
distribution business enhances our ability to provide a high level of customer service by improving our
understanding of our customers’ product, final application and service needs, which allows us to more
effectively develop and market new products to meet such requirements. In addition, our distribution
business decreases concentration risk, with our top 10 customers in 2015 representing approximately
20% of our revenue. Our distribution business also enables us to reduce delivery time and increase our
flexibility in adapting to customer needs. Our distribution market position also provides for sales
stability and consistent order inflow to our mills, allowing for production system optimization,
streamlined working capital management and optimization of logistic costs.

**_Optimal Location of Mills, Proximity to Customers and Flexibility and Variety in Production._** Our
CWF and specialty paper mills are located in close proximity to our key commercial markets in Europe
(France, Italy, Spain, Germany, the UK and Portugal) as well as our key customers. These CWF
markets accounted for approximately 71% of demand in Europe and accounted for approximately 68%
of our total deliveries in volume in 2015. We delivered approximately 67% of our specialty papers in
Europe in 2015. The strategic location of our mills allows us to keep logistics costs down, which
generally account for a substantial portion of delivered costs in our industry. Our main CWF
competitors in Europe with mills in Nordic countries are located much further away from our
customers and therefore incur higher logistics costs. Proximity to customers also allows us to better
manage inventories and to provide improved customer service by being able to more quickly respond to
our customers’ needs. Although most large paper machines produce reels of paper, most demand for
CWF and specialty papers in Europe is for sheeted paper, which generates higher margins. As a result,
most paper produced by paper mills needs to be converted to sheets, and in general this conversion
takes place following specific customer orders. To reduce the delivery time of customers’ orders, paper
manufacturers must operate converting facilities close to their principal markets. As our converting
facilities are situated at or near our paper mills, our ability to efficiently satisfy orders while minimizing
waste provides us with a cost advantage over most of our competitors.

We manufacture our CWF on seven medium-width machines, which we believe are best suited for
the production of most CWF products. Since the CWF market generally demands a greater variety of
basis weights and surface finishes than other types of graphic paper, these machines allow us to
produce our paper in a broad range of basis weights and coated surface finishes while maintaining
optimal production runs with minimal waste and downtime between runs.

**_Owned Energy Assets Providing Supply Security._** We own and operate five co-generation plants and
benefit from a sixth plant at Condat, with a total installed capacity of 271MW. We generate more
electricity than we consume through our co-generation plants that produce electrical and thermal
energy fueled by natural gas or biomass, thereby helping to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions and
raising energy efficiency.

**_Supply Chain Integration._** Our integration in each stage of production provides us with full
visibility of the entirety of our supply chain. Our ability to source approximately 30% of our own pulp
and source approximately 76% of our base paper from our mills reduces earnings volatility and
increases our manufacturing flexibility with respect to CWF and specialty papers. We are able to
leverage our increasing base paper integration to generate higher profit margins.

As a result of such supply chain integration, we optimize inventory costs and, with the visibility
provided by our sales and marketing knowledge, are able to adapt the production process to the
changing market environment with full control of the production chain and thereby add value to each
stage. We are integrated upstream in energy and pulp production (partially), as well as downstream via
our distribution business. We believe this provides us with a marked competitive advantage over other
industry participants.

**_Well-Invested Asset Base and Efficient, Low-Cost Production._** All of our mills and paper machines
were modernized through a series of investment projects between 1999 and 2015, totaling
approximately A1.0 billion focused on increasing added value, continuing cost reduction and increasing
environmental performance and co-generation capabilities. We have reorganized production
significantly through targeted headcount reductions, mill restructuring and closures, CWF production

4


-----

homogenization, the interchangeability of production among different mills and investment in
co-generation. We intend to continue increasing our capacity production in specialty papers. We
reduced overall labor costs by 7% between 2013 and 2015, primarily as a result of an overall reduction
in headcount by approximately 14%. Our CWF machines are, we believe, among the most efficient in
Europe and such efficiency, combined with low logistics and converting costs, provides us with a cost
advantage in our key markets.

Our concerted effort to produce at low-cost is underpinned by the many cost-reduction initiatives
we have successfully implemented since 2013. We harmonized the bonus scheme across the Group. At
our Italian mill, we converted part of the fixed labor costs into a variable cost linked to the
performance of the company. Our Italian and French distribution businesses have been restructured to
outsource the transportation activity and centralize management and administrative activities. Similarly,
in Spain, we have centralized the Group’s financial activities and outsourced non-core activities at one
of our mills. We have also embarked on a continuing plan to renegotiate labor agreements with unions
to align incentives towards improved company performance.

**_Skilled Personnel and Incentivized Management._** Our management team has significant operating
experience and is highly regarded by participants in the paper industry. The management team has
successfully reorganized our operations, which are now fully integrated, with centrally managed
purchasing, sales, marketing, risk, management, finance and administration functions. Each of our
senior managers has been granted an incentive package with a strong focus on increasing EBITDA and
cash generation.

**Our Strategy**

Our objectives are to continue to grow in specialty papers, increase our offering of higher margin
products, build on our position as the leading CWF producer in Southern Europe, improve EBITDA
and cash flow and increase the company value. The key elements of our strategy are as follows:

**_Continue to Increase Production of Specialties and Other Higher Margin Products with Growing_**
**_Demand._** We intend to continue focusing on increasing the production of specialty paper products and
distribution of higher grade, heavier weight and sheeted CWF products, which generate higher margins.
In addition, we intend to continue focusing on increasing the share of certain specialty paper products
in our product mix, notably self-adhesive, metalized, 1-side coated and thermal papers, which have all
experienced, and we expect will continue to experience, growing demand, and which we have been
successful in growing our sales at above market rates in 2015. Our know-how of coating technologies
and base papers production positions us well to develop new products for labelling and flexible
packaging, in order to best exploit new market opportunities.

**_Maintain Low-Cost Production and Achieve Further Operating Efficiencies._** We believe we are a
low-cost producer of CWF largely due to our past capital investment projects and capacity
rationalization, which have improved the efficiency of our machines. From 2013 through 2015, we and
the other European CWF producers experienced an improvement in operating ratio (ratio of CWF
deliveries over CWF production capacity) from 86% in 2013 to 94% in 2015. We seek to further
improve the efficiency of all of our mills through the vigorous application of best practices, the use of
up-to-date technological processes and risk management techniques, and thereby increase our cost
competitiveness and margins. We continue to take steps to increase productivity as measured by metric
tons produced per employee. We also measure the performance of each of our mills against internal
and external benchmarks relating to operational key indicators and raw material consumption. We
currently benefit from six co-generation plants with a total installed capacity of 271MW, contributing to
reducing our energy costs through the sale of excess electricity.

**_Focus on Our Customers._** We continue to focus on our core target markets of France, Italy, Spain,
Germany, the UK and Portugal where we enjoy brand awareness and cost advantage over our
competitors. We may seek to further enhance our customer focus by expanding our distribution
capabilities, while maintaining and further developing our relationships with third-party distributors. We
may also seek to expand our direct sales to end-users, and we will continue to carefully evaluate
acquisitions opportunities in the distribution area that may arise from time to time.

**_Disciplined Investment in Key Focus Areas._** We intend to continue to evaluate opportunities to
optimize our asset base, with a focus on existing areas with strong potential growth, including value

added specialties as well as sheeted CWF and CWF in higher grades and heavier weights. As we have
done in the past, we will continue to seek out opportunities to make disciplined investment in organic
growth areas, such as machinery and marketing campaigns, which we expect to result in improved
margins and returns. In addition, we are initiating an upgrade of our IT systems, which we expect to
complete over the next three years.

**_Continue to Respect the Environment._** We intend to continue focusing on the sustainability of our
production and comply with the highest environmental standards. We have improved and will seek to
continue improving our environmental performance by reducing our CO2 emissions, water use, energy
consumption and sludge sent to disposal sites. We believe that our products and practices comply with
the highest social and environmental standards in the market and all our mills have met the strictest
audit standards, and carry ISO 14001 and EMAS Environmental Management certifications and
ISO 50001 energy management certification guaranteeing transparent and responsible environmental
performance. All of our wood and pulp purchases are sourced from sustainably-managed forests and
certified under the PEFC (Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification) and FSC (Forest
Stewardship Council) chain of custody standards. We also intend to continue publishing environmental
reports and providing information on the sources of raw materials used in our products.

**Industry Trends and Outlook**

**_Specialty Papers_**

Specialty paper markets are typically characterized by value added products and higher margins.
According to various industry analysts, it is expected that European demand for the type of specialty
papers we produce is increasing in numerous applications and will experience moderate to strong
annual growth rates from 2016 through 2018 (other than carbonless paper for which a decline is
expected over the same period) due to structural growth drivers, such as new consumption habits and
legislation (for example, in the food industry, requiring larger labels or relabeling of existing products).
To respond to increasing demand in specialty papers, we are successfully shifting our product mix
toward these paper grades, which enjoy healthy and growing markets. Our specialty paper sales by
value increased from 19% of our revenue in 2011 to 27% in 2015.

**_CWF_**

_Reduction of Capacity_

In the past decade, the European CWF industry has experienced overcapacity, due to a history of
industry-wide investment in new production capacity coupled with slower and often negative demand
growth and a reduction in exports, which all contributed to reduced paper prices. In response to
challenging conditions, CWF industry participants, including Lecta, closed almost 4.1 million metric
tons of production capacity between 2006 and 2015, representing approximately 41% of the total
European capacity in 2006, with Lecta alone accounting for approximately 350,000 metric tons of
reduced capacity.

_Demand for CWF_

In recent years, the growth of the commercial printing and advertising sectors in Europe has been
continuously challenged due to the emergence of digital media. Total CWF volume deliveries in Europe
in 2015 decreased by 2% compared to 2014, with this decrease affecting all Western European
countries. According to EMGE, demand for CWF in Europe is expected to decrease at a CAGR of
1.9% from 2015 through 2020.

At the same time, the European CWF industry was also negatively affected by CWF capacity
expansions in Asia, which had the adverse effect of reducing Asian demand for both reels and sheeted
products produced in Europe. In the other direction, exports from China to Western Europe accounted
for 2% of CWF demand in 2015, with Chinese imports greatly restricted by anti-subsidy duties as high
as 12% and anti-dumping duties of up to 35.1% imposed by the European Union on Chinese CWF
imports in May 2011. Such duties were expected to expire in May 2016. On February 12, 2016,
however, five EU CWF producers, including Lecta, filed a request with the European Commission for
review of these duties. On May 13, 2016, the European Commission issued a notice of initiation of an
expiry review. The anti-subsidy duties and the anti-dumping duties will continue to apply pending the

6

outcome of the review, which is expected to be completed within 15 months of the publication of the
notice.

**_UWF Paper_**

The UWF paper market is regarded as a more mature sector and is expected to experience
general decline in demand from 2016 through 2018 due to the impact of the digital alternatives.
However, we expect global demand to be supported by a resilient publication market.

**Recent Developments**

Based on an analysis of our preliminary monthly financial accounts for the two months ended
May 31, 2016, we estimate that our revenue was between A235 million and A240 million, which is
slightly lower by approximately 1% to 3% than our revenue for the corresponding period in 2015, and
that our EBITDA was between A22.5 million and A23.5 million, which is higher by approximately 15%
to 21% than our EBITDA for the corresponding period in 2015. In addition, we estimate that our loss
after tax generated in the two months ended May 31, 2016 was between A(1) million and A0 million,
which is better than our loss after tax for the corresponding period in 2015.

The estimated increase in EBITDA for the two months ended May 31, 2016 is primarily due to an
improvement in margin on variable costs and lower fixed costs.

_The above information is based on our management’s review of our preliminary results and estimates,_
_which have not been audited or reviewed by any audit firm, and is not intended to be a comprehensive_
_statement of our financial or operational results for the two months ended May 31, 2016. Our preliminary_
_results are based on a number of assumptions and judgments, and as a result, reflect a certain level of_
_uncertainty and remain subject to change. The estimated results described above may change in connection_
_with the preparation of our second quarter accounts and our normal end-of-quarter review process. Our_
_preliminary results for the two months ended May 31, 2016 may not be indicative of our results for the three_
_months ended June 30, 2016 or any other period. As such, you should not place undue reliance on them._

_discussion of certain of the factors that could affect our future performance and results of operations._

**The Transactions and Use of Proceeds**

The Offerings and the Exchange Offer will settle on the Issue Date at the same time as a number
of corporate restructuring steps being undertaken by Lecta, as described in more detail below. The cash
proceeds of the Offerings, along with cash currently held by the Issuer, will be used to satisfy and
discharge the Existing Notes (to the extent not validly tendered and accepted in the Exchange Offer)
on the Issue Date and to pay certain fees and expenses in connection with the transactions. See ‘‘Use
of Proceeds.’’

**_The Refinancing_**

The Offerings, the Exchange Offer and the application of the proceeds therefrom along with the
use of cash currently held by the Issuer and the entry by the Issuer and certain of its subsidiaries into
the New Revolving Credit Facility are collectively referred to in this Offering Memorandum as the
‘‘Refinancing.’’ It is not expected that the New Revolving Credit Facility will be drawn on the Issue
Date.

_The Exchange Offer_

The Issuer offered eligible holders of its existing A390,000,000 aggregate principal amount Existing
Floating Rate Notes to exchange any and all validly tendered and accepted outstanding Existing
Floating Rate Notes (ISIN: XS0780141999/Common Code: 078014199) for its Floating Rate Senior
Secured Notes upon the terms and conditions set forth in an exchange offer memorandum dated
July 18, 2016 (the ‘‘Exchange Offer Memorandum’’). The combined aggregate principal amount of the
Floating Rate Senior Secured Notes (including the Floating Rate Senior Secured Notes offered hereby
for cash consideration and the Exchange Notes) and the Fixed Rate Senior Secured Notes offered
hereby is equal to A600,000,000, with A124,999,000 aggregate principal amount of Floating Rate Senior
Secured Notes being issued for cash consideration in the Offering of the Floating Rate Senior Secured
Notes, A100,001,000 aggregate principal amount of Exchange Notes being issued pursuant to the

7


-----

Exchange Offer and A375,000,000 aggregate principal amount of Fixed Rate Senior Secured Notes
being issued in the Offerings. The completion of the Offerings described herein is not contingent upon
completion of the Exchange Offer.

The Exchange Offer commenced on July 18, 2016 and expired at 12:00 p.m. London (UK) local
time on July 22, 2016 (the ‘‘Expiration Deadline’’). Among others, U.S. Persons (as defined in
Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act) and persons located within the United States were not
eligible to participate in the Exchange Offer. On July 22, 2016, the Issuer announced that A124,354,000
in outstanding principal amount of the Existing Floating Rate Notes had been validly tendered for
exchange pursuant to the Exchange Offer.

The price at which the Floating Rate Senior Secured Notes offered hereby will be issued is
referred to as the ‘‘New Issue Price.’’ On July 22, 2016, the Issuer announced that it was accepting an
aggregate principal amount A99,018,000 of validly offered Existing Floating Rate Notes in the Exchange
Offer on a pro rata basis, and determined the New Issue Price to be 99%. The Exchange Notes and the
Floating Rate Senior Secured Notes offered hereby for cash consideration will both be issued under the
Floating Rate Senior Secured Notes Indenture, will have identical terms and conditions and will be part
of the same series of notes. The Exchange Notes and the Floating Rate Senior Secured Notes offered
hereby will be guaranteed by the same subsidiaries of the Issuer and secured by first-ranking security
interests, on an equal and ratable basis, in the Collateral.

Any holder of the Existing Floating Rate Notes who validly offered its notes prior to the
Expiration Deadline and did not withdraw its offer pursuant to the terms and conditions of the
Exchange Offer will receive Floating Rate Senior Secured Notes, on the settlement date of the
Exchange Offer, in an aggregate amount (rounded down to the nearest A1,000) calculated by
multiplying (i) the aggregate principal amount of the Existing Floating Rate Notes validly tendered by
such holder and that are accepted for exchange by the Issuer, by (ii) the ratio (rounded down to six
decimal places) resulting from the division of the exchange price, which has been set at 100%, by the
New Issue Price (the ‘‘Exchange Ratio’’) and after relevant adjustments for acceptances on a pro rata
basis.

On the settlement date of the Exchange Offer, accrued and unpaid interest up to, but not
including, such settlement date, on the Existing Floating Rate Notes accepted by the Issuer in the
Exchange Offer will be paid in cash. It is expected that the Offerings will close concurrently with the
settlement of the Exchange Offer on July 27, 2016.

respect to certain receivables and bank accounts, which will form part of the Collateral.

While we currently intend to transfer the distribution business of Torraspapel S.A. to Dispap S.A.,
there is no obligation to do so. See ‘‘Description of the Notes—Credit enhancement—Post-Closing
Actions’’ and ‘‘Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Post-Closing obligations with respect to
grant of guarantee and security.’’

Should Torraspapel S.A. transfer the business, we have agreed that, within 15 days after such

under applicable local laws. For more information, see
‘‘Description of the Notes—Credit enhancement,’’ ‘‘Risk
Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and Our Structure—The
Guarantees are significantly limited by applicable laws and are
subject to certain limitations or defenses’’ and ‘‘Limitation on
Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security
Interests.’’ See also Annex A hereto.

**Ranking of the Guarantees . . . . . .** The Guarantee of each Guarantor will be a general
unsubordinated obligation of such Guarantor and will:

              - rank pari passu in right of payment with all existing and
future debt of such Guarantor that is not subordinated to
such Guarantee;

              - rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future
subordinated obligations of such Guarantor;

              - be secured by security interests in the Collateral in favor of
the Security Trustee over certain of such Guarantor’s assets,
including shares in certain subsidiaries, but not all assets and
no real property;

              - be structurally subordinated to all liabilities (including trade
payables), disqualified stock and preferred stock of such
Guarantor’s subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes;
and

              - be effectively subordinated to any existing and future debt of
such Guarantor that is secured with property and assets that
do not secure such Guarantee, to the extent of the value of
the assets securing such debt.

**Security . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The Notes and related Guarantees (other than the Guarantee to
be provided by Polyedra S.p.A.) will be secured by security
interests in certain of the Issuer’s or the Guarantors’ assets,
consisting, in the case of the Issuer, of its shares in Sub
Lecta S.A., its bank account and the Intercompany Loans held by
it, and in the case of the several Guarantors, of shares in certain
subsidiaries held by such Guarantors and certain other assets.

The security interests in the Collateral securing the Notes and
the Guarantees will be first ranking except that the New
Revolving Credit Facility and certain hedging debt will be repaid
in priority upon enforcement of the security.

The security interests will be granted by the Guarantors and the
Issuer in favor of the Security Trustee for the benefit of the
finance parties under the New Revolving Credit Facility, certain
hedging counterparties and the Floating Rate Senior Secured
Notes Trustee as trustee for the holders of the Floating Rate
Senior Secured Notes and the Fixed Rate Senior Secured Notes
Trustee as trustee for the holders of the Fixed Rate Senior
Secured Notes.

Should the Company transfer the distribution business of
Torraspapel S.A. to Dispap S.A. in connection with the Permitted
Reorganization, we have agreed that, within 15 days after such
transfer is effective, Dispap S.A. will provide certain security
interests in certain of its assets as part of the Collateral. See
‘‘Description of the Notes—Credit enhancement—Post-Closing
Actions’’ and Annex A hereto for a description of the Collateral.

For more information, see ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Related to the
Notes and Our Structure,’’ ‘‘Description of the Notes—Credit
enhancement’’ and ‘‘Limitation on Validity and Enforceability of
the Guarantees and the Security Interests.’’

**Intercreditor Agreement . . . . . . . .** Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, the Floating Rate
Senior Secured Notes Trustee and the Fixed Rate Senior Secured
Notes Trustee will agree to certain provisions that, among other
things, give effect to the priority of the application of proceeds in
the event of enforcement. In particular, proceeds from the sale
of the Collateral shall be applied first in favor of the lenders
under the New Revolving Credit Facility and certain hedging
counterparties and thereafter to the Floating Rate Senior
Secured Notes Trustee on behalf of holders of Floating Rate
Senior Secured Notes and the Fixed Rate Senior Secured Notes
Trustee on behalf of holders of Fixed Rate Senior Secured Notes
and to other Pari Passu Debt (as defined therein) that is secured
by the Collateral. In addition, the Intercreditor Agreement
provides that holders of the Floating Rate Senior Secured Notes
and the Fixed Rate Senior Secured Notes will vote in respect of
the enforcement of the Collateral as a single class and that only
the Security Trustee can enforce security. See ‘‘Description of
Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement.’’

**Optional Redemption . . . . . . . . . .** Prior to August 1, 2017, we will be entitled at our option to
redeem all or a portion of the Floating Rate Senior Secured
Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal
amount thereof, plus the applicable ‘‘make-whole’’ premium
described in this Offering Memorandum and accrued and unpaid
interest to, but not including, the redemption date. See
‘‘Description of the Notes—Optional Redemption—Floating Rate
Notes.’’ The Issuer may redeem the Floating Rate Senior
Secured Notes in whole or in part at any time on or after
August 1, 2017, at the redemption prices specified herein.

Prior to August 1, 2019, we will be entitled at our option to
redeem all or a portion of the Fixed Rate Senior Secured Notes
at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount
thereof, plus the applicable ‘‘make-whole’’ premium described in
this Offering Memorandum and accrued and unpaid interest to,
but not including, the redemption date. See ‘‘Description of the
Notes—Optional Redemption—Fixed Rate Notes.’’

In addition, prior to August 1, 2019, we will be entitled at our
option on one or more occasions to redeem the Fixed Rate
Senior Secured Notes in an aggregate principal amount not to
exceed 35% of the aggregate principal amount outstanding of
Fixed Rate Senior Secured Notes with the net cash proceeds
from certain equity offerings at a redemption price equal to
106.500% of the aggregate principal amount of the Fixed Rate
Senior Secured Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the
redemption date. The Issuer may also redeem the Fixed Rate

15


-----

Senior Secured Notes in whole or in part at any time on or after
August 1, 2019 at the redemption prices specified herein.

See ‘‘Description of the Notes—Optional Redemption.’’

**Additional Amounts; Tax**
**Redemption . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** All payments in respect of the Notes or the Guarantees will be
made without withholding or deduction for any taxes or other
governmental charges, except to the extent required by law. If
withholding or deduction is required by law of a relevant
jurisdiction, subject to certain exceptions, we or the relevant
Guarantor will pay additional amounts so that the net amount
you receive is no less than the amount you would have received
in the absence of such withholding or deduction. See
‘‘Description of the Notes—Additional Amounts.’’

If certain changes in the law of any relevant taxing jurisdiction
become effective that would impose withholding taxes or other
deductions on the payments on the Notes or the Guarantees, we
may redeem the Notes in whole, but not in part, at any time at a
redemption price equal to their principal amount, plus accrued
and unpaid interest, if any, and additional amounts, if any, to the
date of redemption.

**Change of Control . . . . . . . . . . . .** If we experience certain change of control events, as described in
the Floating Rate Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Fixed
Rate Senior Secured Notes Indenture, we will be required to
make an offer to purchase all outstanding Notes at a redemption
price of 101% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued
interest to the date of repurchase. However, a change of control
will be deemed not to have occurred if our ratio of net debt as
of the most recent balance sheet date to EBITDA over the most
recently completed four fiscal quarters remains above a certain
level pro forma for the transaction.

**Certain Covenants . . . . . . . . . . . .** We will issue the Floating Rate Senior Secured Notes and the
Fixed Rate Senior Secured Notes under the Floating Rate Senior
Secured Notes Indenture and the Fixed Rate Senior Secured
Notes Indenture, respectively, among others, the Issuer, the
Guarantors, the Floating Rate Senior Secured Notes Trustee and
the Fixed Rate Senior Secured Notes Trustee, as the case may be
under such Indenture, and the Security Trustee. The Floating
Rate Senior Secured Notes Indenture and Fixed Rate Senior
Secured Notes Indenture will, among other things, limit our
ability to:

              - incur or guarantee additional indebtedness;

              - pay dividends or make other distributions or repurchase or
redeem our stock;

              - make investments or other restricted payments;

              - create liens;

              - sell assets;

              - enter into transactions with affiliates;

              - impose restrictions on the ability of our restricted
subsidiaries to pay dividends;

              - designate restricted and unrestricted subsidiaries; and

              - consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our
assets.

All of these limitations will be subject to a number of important
qualifications and exceptions. See ‘‘Description of the Notes—
Certain Covenants.’’

**Transfer Restrictions . . . . . . . . . .** The offering of the Notes has not been registered under the U.S.
Securities Act or any other applicable securities laws. The Notes
are subject to restrictions on transferability and resale. See
‘‘Notice to Investors.’’

**Absence of a Public Market for the**
**Notes . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The Notes are new securities for which there is currently no
established trading market. Accordingly, there can be no
assurance as to the development or liquidity of any market for
them. The Initial Purchasers have advised us that they intend to
make a market in the Notes. However, they are not obligated to
do so and may discontinue any market making at any time at
their sole discretion and without notice.

**Additional Notes . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The Issuer may issue Additional Notes as described under
‘‘Description of the Notes.’’ These Additional Notes, even if they
are treated for non-tax purposes as part of the same series as the
applicable series of original Notes, in some cases may be treated
as a separate series for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In such
case, the Additional Notes may be considered to have original
issue discount which may adversely affect the market value of the
applicable series of original Notes if the Additional Notes are not
otherwise distinguishable from the applicable series of original
Notes. See ‘‘Tax Considerations—Certain U.S. Federal Income
Tax Consequences.’’

**Concurrent Exchange Offer . . . . . .** On July 18, 2016, the Issuer announced an offer to exchange (the
‘‘Exchange Offer’’), any and all of its outstanding Floating Rate
Senior Secured Notes due 2018 (the ‘‘Existing Floating Rate
Notes’’) for an aggregate principal amount of Floating Rate
Senior Secured Notes due 2022 (the ‘‘Exchange Notes’’) to be
determined in accordance with the Exchange Ratio. The
Exchange Ratio is required to be calculated by dividing the
exchange price, which has been set at 100%, by the issue price of
the Floating Rate Senior Secured Notes being offered for cash
consideration hereby. The Exchange Offer expired at 12 pm
London (UK) time on July 22, 2016 and the Issuer announced
on the same day that it had accepted A99,018,000 in aggregate
principal amount of its Existing Floating Rate Notes and, after
application of the Exchange Ratio, would be issuing an aggregate
principal amount of A100,001,000 of its Floating Rate Senior
Secured Notes pursuant to the Exchange Offer. The Exchange
Offer and the Offerings are expected to settle on the same day.
The Floating Rate Senior Secured Notes offered hereby for cash
consideration and the Exchange Notes will comprise one series
of notes. Unless the context requires otherwise, references to the
‘‘Floating Rate Senior Secured Notes’’ in this ‘‘The Offerings’’
section and in the ‘‘Description of the Notes’’ refer to such notes
to be issued for cash consideration in the Offerings and
Exchange Notes issued in the Exchange Offer. Completion of the
Offerings is not contingent upon the completion of the Exchange
Offer.

**Listing and Trading . . . . . . . . . . .** Application has been made to list the Notes on the Official List
of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and to admit the Notes to
trading on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange’s Euro MTF market.

(1) Revenue consists of sales of paper (including paper produced by third parties and sold through our distribution business)
and energy.

(2) We define EBITDA as earnings before depreciation, amortization, non-recurring items, finance costs, net income from
associates and income tax. EBITDA includes non-cash expenses and income, consisting of variations in inventories and
operating provisions. EBITDA does not necessarily indicate whether cash flow will be sufficient or available for cash
requirements and may not be indicative of our results of operations. In addition, EBITDA as we define it may not be
comparable to other similar titled measures used by other companies. Moreover, EBITDA as presented herein and in our
financial statements is not calculated in the same way as EBITDA is calculated under the Indentures and the New
Revolving Credit Facility.

(3) Non-recurring items include profits and losses on disposals or impairments of investments in associates, available-for-sale
financial assets, and certain long-lived assets, of which goodwill, costs of restructuring and material reorganization,
acquisition costs relating to business combinations and profit following immediate recognition of negative goodwill.

(4) Non-recurring items for the year ended December 31, 2013 include, among others, (i) a charge of A30.0 million on
property, land and equipment (resulting mostly from (a) an impairment charge of A24.7 million on tangible assets used at
our mill and co-generation plant in Sarri`a de Ter, and (b) an impairment charge of A4.2 million on tangible assets used at
our co-generation plant in Motril, partially offset by a A4.6 million reduction of the impairment charge on Condat tangible
assets used at production line No. 6, closed in July 2013), and (ii) a charge of A16.9 million relating to organization
efficiency program costs (incurred mainly in connection with the restructuring of the activities of Torraspapel S.A.,
Condat S.A.S. and Polyedra S.p.A.).

(5) Non-recurring items for the year ended December 31, 2014 include, among others, a charge of A14.1 million relating to
organization efficiency program costs (incurred mainly in connection with the restructuring of the activities of
Torraspapel S.A., Condat Holding S.A.S. and Condat S.A.S.), partially offset by a gain of A3.9 million on property, land and
equipment (resulting mostly from a gain of A4.2 million on the reversal of the impairment of tangible assets used at our
co-generation plant in Motril, partially offset by an impairment charge of A0.6 million on tangible assets at our Sarri`a de
Ter plant).

**RISK FACTORS**

_You should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision. The risks_
_described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks not presently known or currently deemed_
_immaterial may also impair our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our business, results_
_of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. The_
_trading price of the Notes could decline due to any of these risks, and you may lose all or part of your_
_investment. This Offering Memorandum also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and_
_uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in such forward-looking_
_statements as a result of certain factors, including the risks we face that are described below and elsewhere_
_in this Offering Memorandum._

**Risks Related to Our Business**

**_Customer demand is difficult to forecast accurately and, as a result, we may be unable to match production of_**
**_our specialty products with customer demand._**

We make planning and spending decisions, including determining the levels of business that we will
seek and accept, production schedules, component procurement commitments, personnel needs and
other resource requirements, based on our estimates of product demand and customer requirements.
Our specialty products are typically purchased pursuant to individual purchase orders. While our
customers may provide us with their demand forecasts, they are typically not contractually committed to
buy any quantity of products beyond firm purchase orders. Furthermore, many of our customers may
increase, decrease, cancel or delay purchase orders already in place without significant penalty. The
short-term nature of commitments by our customers and the possibility of unexpected changes in
demand for their products reduce our ability to accurately estimate future customer requirements. On
occasion, customers may require rapid increases in production, which can strain our resources, cause
our manufacturing to be negatively impacted by materials shortages, necessitate more onerous
procurement commitments and reduce our gross margin. We may not have sufficient capacity at any
given time to meet the volume demands of our customers, or one or more of our suppliers may not
have sufficient capacity at any given time to meet our volume demands. If any of our major customers
decrease, stop or delay purchasing our products for any reason, we will likely have excess
manufacturing capacity or inventory and it could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

**_We operate in a cyclical industry, in which product prices and raw material costs are volatile, and periods of_**
**_low product prices or high raw material costs negatively affect our profitability and cash flows._**

The markets for our products and raw materials are commodity markets to a significant extent and
prices for our products are affected by industry-wide production and capacity levels and by demand for
our products, which are influenced by global economic trends, demographic trends, technological
developments, trends in end-user preferences and inventory levels maintained by our customers.
Changes in these factors have resulted in significant fluctuations in the prices for our products. The
timing and the magnitude of changes in our product prices have varied significantly over time and have
been unpredictable.

Changes in prices differ between products and geographic regions. While we are a significant
participant in most of the markets in which we compete, neither our actions nor those of any one
industry participant have more than a small influence on changes in product prices.

Our main raw material costs are for pulp and energy. A significant increase in prices we pay for
these raw materials would significantly increase our production costs and could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows if we were unable to
increase our product prices sufficiently to maintain margins. Compared to many of our competitors, we
are particularly susceptible to volatility in pulp prices because we have a lower degree of pulp
integration, do not hedge against fluctuations in the price of pulp and have limited ability to pass
through pulp price increases to our customers. World pulp prices have been considerably volatile in
recent years as a result of periodic supply/demand imbalances in the pulp and paper industries and are
subject to significant fluctuations over short periods of time depending on a number of factors,
including global demand for pulp products, global pulp production capacity and inventories, strategies
adopted by major pulp producers, and the availability of substitutes for various pulp products. All of
these factors are beyond our control. Price fluctuations occur not only from year to year but also within

23


-----

a given year as a result of global and regional economic conditions, capacity constraints, facility
openings and closures, and the supply of and demand for both raw materials and finished products,
among other factors. For example, between 2011 and 2013, the price of pulp remained generally stable,
which was attributable in large part to an increased demand for pulp combined with limited increases
in production capacity during this period due to delays in greenfield projects in the pulp industry and
closures and/or conversions of existing pulp mills. However, the price of pulp decreased in early 2014
due to weakness in demand before stabilizing during the third quarter of 2014. During the last quarter
of 2014 and 2015, prices began increasing again as a result of low customer inventories and increased
demand for pulp. In late 2015 prices began to decrease due to ongoing pulp capacity increases,
particularly in Latin America, and lower demand. Pulp prices have continued decreasing in the first and
second quarters of 2016. As a result of unpredictable and substantial changes in our product prices and
raw material costs, our financial results have varied significantly over time. In a period of sustained low
product prices or high raw material costs, we may be unable to operate our production facilities in a
cost-effective manner, pursue our strategic initiatives and meet all of our financial obligations.

Paper manufacturing is a highly capital-intensive industry and a large portion of our operating
costs, as well as those of our competitors, are fixed. Additionally, paper machines are large and
complex and are more efficient when operated continuously. Consequently, certain manufacturers
choose to continue to run their machines whenever marginal sales exceed the marginal costs. Our
ability to achieve acceptable margins is principally dependent on managing our cost structure and
managing changes in raw material prices, which represent a large component of our operating costs and
fluctuate based upon factors beyond our control. If the prices of our products decline, or if our raw
material costs increase, or both, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition, results of operations and cash flows.

**_Global economic conditions and political events could adversely affect our business, results of operations and_**
**_financial condition._**

We have historically faced, and continue to face, significant exposure to global economic trends,
fluctuating levels of investment in advertising and other activities which foster demand for our products
and general liquidity and credit conditions. We cannot predict with any certainty what impact such
events could have on our major customers, including a disruption in the ability of our significant
customers to access sources of liquidity, or on our ability to implement our strategic plans and we may
face difficulties in successfully marketing our products, collecting on our accounts receivable and/or
obtaining financing for our business on terms acceptable to us.

Uncertainty caused by the prevailing adverse economic conditions contributed to a reduction in
business and consumer spending in, among others, the advertising industry, from which we derive a
significant amount of the demand for our products. From 2012 to 2014, the demand for specialty
papers in Europe displayed overall slight growth, with relatively strong growth rates in labelling and
flexible packaging, pressure-sensitive label, metallized, release base and self-adhesive paper products. In
2015, however, there were modest reductions in overall demand in Europe, partly because of the weak
performance of woodfree paper products due to the structural decline in demand for these products.
The slow recovery of the global economy has been and continues to be uneven and significant risks
remain as a result of turmoil in the sovereign debt markets, in Europe generally and in Southern
Europe in particular. Financial markets and the supply of credit may continue to be negatively
impacted by ongoing fears surrounding the sovereign debts and/or fiscal deficits of several countries in
Europe, the possibility of further downgrading of, or defaults on, sovereign debt, concerns about a
slowdown in growth in certain economies and uncertainties regarding the overall stability of the euro
and the sustainability of the euro as a single currency given the diverse economic and political
circumstances in individual Member States. We cannot predict the severity, timing or duration of any
future downturn in our key markets, including if economic conditions deteriorate as a result of
sovereign debt concerns or any other economic factor.

In addition, past or future political events in Europe could cause further economic uncertainty in
Europe and globally. Our main market, Spain, is experiencing a period of political uncertainty.
Following the 2015 general elections, no party secured an absolute majority, resulting in a fragmented
parliament. A second general election was held on June 26, 2016 and no party has been able to secure
an absolute majority and to install a government. In September 2015, a coalition of political parties
called Junts per Si won the most seats in the Catalan regional parliament. This development may lead
to greater calls for the secession of Catalonia. Although the constitutionality of the secession movement

24


-----

is not clear, political uncertainty could result, which could adversely affect the Spanish economy and
our business. In the three months ended March 31, 2016 and the year ended December 31, 2015, our
paper sales in Spain represented 16% and 15%, respectively, of our paper sales by volume. The
occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition, results of operations and cash flows.

**_The United Kingdom’s recent referendum on membership in the European Union and the results of_**
**_implementing that referendum may adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations_**
**_and cash flows._**

In a non-binding referendum on the United Kingdom’s membership in the European Union on
June 23, 2016, a majority of the United Kingdom’s electorate voted for the United Kingdom’s
withdrawal from the European Union. If the outcome of the referendum eventually results in the exit
of the United Kingdom from the European Union (‘‘Brexit’’), a process of negotiation would determine
the future terms of the United Kingdom’s relationship with the European Union. The UK government
has not, as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, indicated a timeline for taking any legal acts
necessary to effectuate Brexit. We cannot assure you when, if ever, the UK government will begin the
withdrawal process and, if and when it does, how long such process would take. Relevant European
Union law suggests that any negotiation could last up to two years before withdrawal takes effect.

The result of the referendum has caused and is likely in the future to cause volatility in the
financial markets. Such volatility may affect prevailing interest rates, which in turn may affect our
business operations by increasing our cost of servicing our borrowings subject to variable interest rates
(including the New Revolving Credit Facility and the Floating Rate Senior Secured Notes) and
increasing the cost of refinancing of our existing borrowings. See ‘‘—We are exposed to interest rate
risks as certain of our borrowings bear interest at floating rates that could rise significantly, increasing
our interest cost and reducing cash flow.’’ Such volatility may also adversely affect our ability to
refinance our existing indebtedness when due on commercially acceptable terms or at all. See ‘‘—Risks
Related to the Notes and Our Structure—We require a significant amount of cash to service our debt
and for other general corporate purposes. Our ability to generate sufficient cash depends on many
factors beyond our control.’’ The result of the referendum may in the future cause certain adverse
effects on European economic conditions and may have adverse effects on levels of economic activity in
the states in which we operate, including, but not limited to, adverse effects on investment in
advertising and other activities which foster demand for our products. See ‘‘—Global economic
conditions and political events could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial
condition.’’

Depending on the terms of Brexit, if any, the United Kingdom could also lose access to the single
EU market and to the global trade deals negotiated by the European Union on behalf of its members.
A decline in trade could also affect the attractiveness of the United Kingdom as a global investment
center and, as a result, could have a detrimental impact on the level of investment in the United
Kingdom and ultimately on UK economic growth. The uncertainty concerning the timing and terms of
Brexit could also have a negative impact on the growth of the UK economy and cause greater volatility
in the pound sterling. New or modified trading arrangements between the United Kingdom and other
countries may have a material adverse effect on our export volumes to the United Kingdom. Any of
the foregoing factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of
operations and cash flows.

**_Changes in economic conditions, consumer preferences or new technologies will continue to affect our business_**
**_and our ability to compete successfully._**

Much of the demand for our products is generated directly or indirectly by the advertising
industry, whether by printers, direct mail campaigns, magazine publishers or other ultimate end-users of
paper. As a result, when the economy is growing, our customers’ demand for our products generally
increases, but when the economy slows, advertising and promotional expenditures are generally cut
back and our customers’ demand for our products declines. Historically, when the global economy is
growing, spending on advertising increases sooner and at a faster rate than the overall economic growth
rate, and conversely, when the global economy slows, spending on advertising decreases sooner and to
a greater extent than the overall economic slowdown. We are therefore vulnerable to a weakening
economy, and any slowing or perceived slowing of the economy in general or the advertising market in

25


-----

particular could be expected to have an adverse impact on our customers’ demand for our products
and, therefore, to adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Changes in consumer preferences affect both the demand for paper in general and the demand for
specific grades of paper. Our ability to continue to meet the shifting demands of paper consumers
depends upon a variety of factors, including our ability to foresee or identify changes in consumer
preferences. Some of the most significant changes in consumer preferences include interest in
environmentally friendly products and the use of e-mail and electronic media instead of paper. The
widespread availability of electronic media and the Internet and the trend towards ever greater use of
computers may reduce the demand for paper and generally have a significant adverse impact on future
paper consumption patterns.

In addition, we believe that new technologies or novel processes may emerge and that existing
technologies may be further developed in the fields in which we operate, both of which could impact
production methods or product quality. Unexpected rapid changes in employed technologies or the
development of novel processes that affect our operations and product range could render the
technologies we utilize or the products we produce obsolete or less competitive in the future. If we are
unable to successfully anticipate technological developments, we may be forced to implement these new
technologies at a substantial cost. Any such development could materially and adversely impact our
business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

We have made significant investments in order to shift our product mix towards higher margin
products, such as value-added specialty papers and are focusing our marketing and distribution efforts
on customers who require these products based on industry analysis and company information that
indicates that demand for these products, unlike demand in the broader CWF industry, will increase
over the medium term due to the diversified range of day-to-day commercial applications of these
papers. We cannot assure you that such demand increases will occur or will occur to the extent
necessary for our strategy to succeed. To the extent that demand does not increase to the extent we
forecast, this could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of
operations and cash flows.

**_Substitution towards digital media and changes in consumer preferences has adversely affected, and will_**
**_continue to adversely affect, demand for our graphic paper products._**

Graphic paper demand in Europe and North America has been in decline since 2009. While some
of the decline can be attributed to weak economic conditions, increased substitution for digital media
has been, and will continue to be, a significant driver of this trend. Over the last ten to fifteen years,
the pulp and paper industry has encountered a growing transformation in consumer preferences.
During this time, readership and circulation of newspapers and magazines has been declining,
accessibility to, and use of, the Internet has increased and mobile devices, including digital tablets, have
become commonplace. As a result, digital alternatives to many traditional paper applications, including
print publishing and advertising, and the storage, duplication, transmission and consumption of written
information more generally, are now readily available. We expect competition from digital media to
continue to adversely affect demand for graphic paper products across the industry, leading to
oversupply, declining revenues from paper businesses and reductions in high cost paper manufacturing
capacity to balance declining demand. Our magazine and catalogue publishing customers may
increasingly use, and compete with businesses that use, other forms of media advertising, and electronic
data transmission and storage, particularly the Internet, and including personal data devices such as
smartphones, e-readers and tablets, instead of paper made by us. In addition, electronic formats for
textbooks could cause the demand to decline for paper textbooks. As the use of these alternatives
grows, demand for our paper products could decline. We are responding by cutting costs and
maintaining operating rates to maximize the significant cash generation potential of these businesses,
while simultaneously shifting our product mix towards expanding our offering of specialty papers.

**_We face intense competition in our industry._**

Our business is highly competitive, and competition is mainly based on price. We frequently
experience pricing pressure from competitors in many of our product lines and geographic markets.
Our ability to compete effectively depends on our cost competitiveness. Some of our competitors may
be lower cost producers than we are in certain markets and may offer our customers competing

26


-----

products at more attractive prices. This competitive environment has been a principal factor behind the
large fluctuations in profitability we have experienced in recent years.

We compete principally with a number of large international paper companies, as well as with
numerous regional and more specialized competitors. Many of our competitors have advantages that
can adversely impact our ability to compete with them. These advantages include lower raw material
and labor costs, as well as, compared to our non-European competitors, fewer environmental and
governmental regulations to comply with than we do. In particular, our competitors who operate fully
integrated production processes are not as vulnerable to increases in the cost of pulp and so are able to
sustain lower prices without suffering deteriorating margins at times of high raw material prices.
Furthermore, some of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we have or may
be better positioned than we are to compete in certain geographic areas. Foreign overcapacity could
result in an increase in the supply of paper products available in our markets. Certain Asian producers,
in particular, have significantly increased exports until 2013 as producers in China were selling in our
markets at less than fair value and have been subsidized by their governments, which is beyond our
control. In May 2011, however, the European Union imposed anti-subsidy duties as high as 12% and
anti-dumping duties of up to 35.1% on Chinese CWF imports, which has led to a substantial decline in
such imports. As a result of the duties, which are expected to remain in place until May 2016, Chinese
exports to Western Europe have declined significantly since 2013. Such duties were to expire in May
2016. On February 12, 2016, however, five EU CWF producers, including Lecta, filed a request with
the European Commission for review of these duties. On May 13, 2016, the European Commission
issued a notice of initiation of an expiry review. The anti-subsidy duties and the anti-dumping duites
will continue to apply pending the outcome of the review, which is expected to be completed within 15
months of the publication of the notice. Should the European Commission decide not to extend the
application of these duties, it is not possible to predict whether affected producers will increase their
sales volume in our markets. The anti-dumping duties for imports into North America were due to
expire in October 2015 but have remained in place while under review by the U.S. International Trade
Commission. A determination by the U.S. International Trade Commission that injury is unlikely to
occur to U.S. producers and workers as a result of coated paper imports into the United States from
China and Indonesia could lead to the existing duties being revoked by the U.S. Department of
Commerce with retroactive effect to October 2015. In January 2016, the U.S. International Trade
Commission voted to conduct a full review in light of the interest shown by local U.S. industry. A
determination is not expected until late 2016. In the absence of such duties, it is likely that Chinese
exporters will again increase their CWF exports into our core markets, which could reduce our market
share. Further, increased competition, including a decrease in import duties in accordance with the
terms of free trade agreements, could cause us to lose market share, increase expenditures or reduce
pricing, any of which have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations
and cash flows.

In addition, competitive pressures will continue to require us to make significant investments in
our manufacturing facilities and in product development. There can be no assurance that we will have
sufficient resources to maintain appropriate levels of capital investment in the future in response to
competitive pressures. In addition, the following factors will affect our ability to compete:

  - the quality of our products;

  - the breadth of our product offerings, including our ability to develop specialty papers in line
with demand;

  - our ability to maintain plant efficiencies and high operating rates and thus lower our average
manufacturing costs per ton;

  - customer service and our ability to distribute our products on time; and

  - the availability and/or cost of pulp, energy and other raw materials and labor.

Increased competition could cause us to lose market share, increase expenditures or reduce
pricing, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of
operations and cash flows.

27


-----

**_A limited number of customers account for a significant portion of our revenue and adverse changes to_**
**_economic or market conditions could have a negative impact on our significant customers._**

We sell a significant portion of our products to a limited number of major customers that
represent a substantial portion of our revenue. In the year ended December 31, 2015, our 10 largest
customers accounted for approximately 20% of our total net sales. See ‘‘Business—Customers.’’ In
addition, some of our largest paper distributors and printer customers have been negatively affected by
the ongoing economic turmoil and their credit profiles have deteriorated over time. Such changes
cannot be predicted and their impacts may be severe. For example, a disruption in the ability of our
significant customers to access liquidity could cause serious disruptions or an overall deterioration of
their businesses, which could lead to a significant reduction in their future orders of our products and
the inability or failure on their part to meet their payment obligations to us, any of which could have a
material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. For example, EBITDA in
the year ended December 31, 2015 was affected by the bankruptcy of three subsidiaries of one of our
major customers, which, despite the protective measures put in place, amounted to approximately
A6.5 million and included a write off of receivables and logistics costs. Similarly, sustained adverse
changes in market conditions for our significant customers’ products, such as lower demand or prices or
increased competition, could also reduce future orders of our products and have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

This may result in the exit of certain customers from the market and/or in further consolidation
among our client base; resulting in higher purchasing power for the remaining customers. The loss of,
or reduction in orders from, any of these significant customers or other customers could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, as
could significant customer disputes regarding shipments, price, quality or other matters.

**_Our business requires significant ongoing capital expenditures._**

We incur significant capital expenditures on an ongoing basis to maintain our equipment and to
comply with environmental and safety laws, as well as to enhance the efficiency of our operations.

Our total capital expenditures were A45.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 and A38.5
million for the twelve months ended March 31, 2016. Going forward, we expect our average annual
maintenance capital expenditure (i.e., capital expenditure required to maintain the operating
performance of our mills and co-generation plants) to be between A25 million and A35 million. We will
undertake any additional, non-maintenance capital expenditure only where we believe such capital
expenditure would be accretive to our EBITDA. For example, we are initiating an upgrade of our IT
systems, which we expect to complete over the next three years. We expect to incur capital expenditures
of approximately A16 million in respect of this project over such period.

We anticipate that our available cash resources, including drawings that we may make under the
New Revolving Credit Facility and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to fund our
operating needs and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future. However, if we require additional
funds for capital expenditures, we may not be able to obtain them on favorable terms, or at all.
Furthermore, if we cannot maintain or upgrade our facilities and equipment as we require or as
necessary to ensure environmental compliance with current or future regulations, it could have an
adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

**_We are exposed to the transaction and translation effect of currency risk, particularly with respect to the_**
**_purchases of pulp denominated in U.S. dollars._**

We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, in particular to fluctuations in
the value of the U.S. dollar and the euro. While the majority of our sales are made in the European
market, the cost of our pulp purchases is affected by the U.S. dollar/euro exchange rate since the
benchmark pulp sale price on the international market is in U.S. dollars per ton. See ‘‘Operating and
Financial Review and Prospects—Factors Affecting Our Results of Operation—Effect of Currency
Fluctuations.’’ Insofar as our cost structure is mainly in euros, changes in the U.S. dollar/euro exchange
rate can have a significant adverse effect on our earnings. The reference currency of our consolidated
financial statements is the euro and we are therefore exposed to both transactional- and translationalrelated exchange risks. For example, our U.S. dollar-denominated purchases of pulp may fluctuate due
to the appreciation or depreciation of the euro against the U.S. dollar, which could impact our revenue,
whereas our cost structure, which is principally denominated in euro, would not change proportionally.

28


-----

In addition, the value of our pulp inventory and cash balances in U.S. dollars when translated into euro
for purposes of the preparation of our consolidated financial statements may affect our balance sheet
and the reporting of our working capital, including our reported net debt. See ‘‘Operating and
Financial Review and Prospects—Factors Affecting Our Results of Operation—Effect of Currency
Fluctuations.’’

**_We are exposed to interest rate risks as certain of our borrowings bear interest at floating rates that could rise_**
**_significantly, increasing our interest cost and reducing cash flow._**

Our borrowings under the New Revolving Credit Facility and interest payable on the Floating Rate
Senior Secured Notes will bear interest at periodic rates equal to in respect of the New Revolving
Credit Facility, LIBOR or, in relation to any borrowing in Euro, EURIBOR and in respect of the
Floating Rate Senior Secured Notes, EURIBOR, both adjusted periodically, plus a certain spread. We
will also be subject to paying periodic commitment fees in connection with the New Revolving Credit
Facility. In addition, we may procure additional indebtedness at floating rates in the future. The
applicable interest rates could rise significantly in the future, thereby increasing our interest expenses
associated with these obligations, reducing cash flow available for capital expenditures and hindering
our ability to make payments on the Notes. Although we may hedge the interest rates with respect to
the New Revolving Credit Facility, we are under no obligation to do so under the Floating Rate Senior
Secured Notes Indenture and we may not be able to obtain such hedges, or replace such hedges on
terms that are acceptable to us, and any such hedge may not be fully effective, which would expose us
to interest rate risk.

**_We may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of current or future acquisitions._**

We intend to continue participating in the consolidation of the European paper and paper
distribution market and to expand our existing business on a selective basis. Growth can place
significant strain on our management resources and financial and accounting control systems. Our
management needs to identify appropriate investments and subsequently integrate, train and manage
increased numbers of employees as we acquire new companies or assets. Unprofitable investments or
an ability to integrate or manage new investments could adversely affect our results of operations. Any
future acquisitions or investments will also involve financial, managerial and operational challenges,
including:

  - the diversion of management attention from other business concerns;

  - difficulty with integrating businesses, operations, personnel and financial and other systems;

  - difficulty in obtaining regulatory approvals;

  - increased levels of debt potentially leading to an associated reduction in the ratings of our
debt securities;

  - an adverse impact on our various financial ratios;

  - the potential loss of key employees and customers;

  - the assumption of and exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of acquired businesses;
and

  - potential disputes with sellers.

In addition, we could experience financial or other setbacks if any of the businesses that we have
acquired or may acquire in the future have problems of which we are not aware or liabilities that
exceed expectations. We may not overcome problems encountered in connection with potential
acquisitions, completed acquisitions or other expansion, and such problems could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

**_We may experience unforeseen difficulties, delays or costs in successfully implementing our business strategy,_**
**_including cost cutting initiatives, reductions in capital expenditures, the raising of capital from asset disposals_**
**_and achieving previously announced targets, and any such actions may not yield the anticipated benefits and_**
**_could also result in Lecta incurring greater costs than anticipated._**

The successful implementation of our business strategy depends upon a variety of factors, including
a number of factors that are outside of our control. We have announced a number of initiatives

29


-----

intended to, among other things, reduce recurring costs through labor force reductions, as well as
undertaken certain efficiency measures intended to reduce waste and raw material use and improve
plant productivity. In 2014 and 2015, we spent A35 million and A10.8 million, respectively, for cost
reduction and productivity improvement. These initiatives are not yet complete and the implementation
of cost cutting measures and disposals are inherently subject to various risks, including unforeseen
additional costs, technical complications, labor unrest, an inability to find willing buyers for planned
disposals and/or our ability to sell such assets at book value. We can provide no assurance that we will
reach these goals, and our strategy may evolve to suit changed circumstances, actual savings achieved
and our ability to make capital expenditures in support of such initiatives. In addition, even if
implemented, such measures may turn out to be less effective than anticipated, become effective later
than anticipated or not be effective at all and could result in Lecta incurring greater costs than
anticipated. Any of these outcomes, individually or in combination, could have a material adverse effect
on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

**_We may face high costs for compliance with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, which_**
**_would reduce profit margins and earnings._**

Our business is subject to extensive environmental, health and safety laws and regulations relating
to controlling discharges and emissions of pollutants to land, water and air, the use and preservation of
natural resources, the noise impact of our operations and the use, disposal and remediation of
hazardous materials. Compliance with these laws and regulations is a significant aspect of our industry,
and substantial legal and financial resources are required to ensure compliance and to manage
environmental risks. Moreover, environmental laws and regulations applicable to us are likely to
become more stringent in the future.

For example, the EU Emissions Trading Scheme, which is effective in the countries in which our
mills operate, requires progressively greater reductions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse-gas
emissions during its third phase of regulation from 2013 to 2020 by requiring regulated installations to
surrender allowances to competent authorities to account for their emissions, which allowances they
must purchase in auctions. Our mills and co-generation facilities generate such gases, and any further
limitations applicable to us may require material expenditures and may have other adverse
consequences. In addition, our facilities have been licensed under the EU the Industrial Emissions
Directive, and conditions imposed by authorities as part of this licensing scheme, or the licensing
scheme under its successor, are likely to become more stringent over time and require material capital
and other expenditures.

Our industry also faces increasing public and community pressure to consume energy more
efficiently, including through the use of renewable fuels, and to reduce waste. In addition, the
European paper industry is required to procure wood and pulp from sustainably managed forests
through a number of certification schemes such as the EU Timber Regulation. While 100% of the
wood used to manufacture our products currently comes from such forests, we may be required to
implement additional measures in an effort to address these concerns in the future, which may require
us to invest substantial resources in adjusting and modifying our production processes.

The risk of substantial environmental costs and liabilities is inherent in our industry, and there can
be no assurance that any incurrence by us of such costs and liabilities, or the adoption of increasingly
strict environmental laws, regulations and enforcement policies and practices, will not have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Although we strive to ensure that our facilities comply with all applicable environmental laws and
permits required for our operations, we have in the past been, and may in the future be, subject to
governmental enforcement actions for failure to comply with environmental regulations. Impacts from
historical operations, including the land or water disposal of waste materials, or our own activities may
require costly investigation and clean-up. In addition, we could become subject to environmental
liabilities resulting from personal injury (including from exposure to hazardous materials in the
workplace), property damage or natural resources damage. Expenditures to comply with future
environmental requirements and the costs related to any potential environmental liabilities and claims
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash
flows.

**_Regulatory changes have affected our business historically and any future changes may have an adverse effect_**
**_on our energy activities._**

Each of the Spanish, French and Italian energy sectors is subject to extensive regulation. This
applies to both conventional and renewable energy sources. We are especially vulnerable to changes to
existing regulations affecting our electricity generating activities, which may have a material adverse
effect on our business.

For example, in June 2014, the Spanish government approved a regulatory framework for the
electricity generating activities from renewable energy sources, cogeneration and waste (the ‘‘Regulatory
Framework’’). This framework sets out a remuneration scheme for existing renewable, co-generation
and waste generation facilities, which applies to our operations. The Regulatory Framework provides
for regulated levels of remuneration that the government has fixed for our electricity production over
three- to six-year periods. The first three-year period and the six-year period end on December 31,
2016 and December 31, 2019, respectively. While the government may alter the rate of investment
return applicable to the most proximate future period, it may not alter the initial investment value or
the regulatory useful life of the investment.

As a result of the implementation of the Regulatory Framework through Royal Decree Law 9/2013
to ensure financial stability of the electricity sector, Law 24/2013 on the Electricity Sector, Royal
Decree 413/2014, Ministerial Order IET/1045/2014 and Ministerial Order IET 1344/2015, we may be
vulnerable to several operational risks, including the following:

  - the Regulatory Framework creates uncertainty over whether the government may introduce a
less favorable remuneration structure applicable to the most proximate future period, which
may affect our ability to make adequate provisions for future operations;

  - our operating costs may exceed those assumed by the government in its calculation of the
amount of remuneration payable under the Regulatory Framework, in which case the
Regulatory Framework would not provide for a reimbursement of the additional costs incurred
by us;

  - we could fail to meet the requisite minimum number of hours of operation per year that the
Regulatory Framework sets out, which may reduce or eliminate our revenue for the relevant
year; and/or

  - we could be forced to participate in financing any temporary imbalance or deficit that is not
offset through tolls and charges in an amount of up to 2% of the estimated regulated income
for the year and proportionally to the remuneration obtained. While we could claim a credit
for the financed amount within a five-year period, the obligation to finance any temporary
imbalance could adversely affect our financial position.

In addition to the Regulatory Framework, electricity producers are required to pay a transmission
and distribution system access fee. In 2011, the government fixed this fee at A0.50 per MWh delivered
to the network. While the fee has remained unchanged to date, any decision by the government to
raise the fee could adversely affect our revenue. Such annual output caps, as well as other regulatory
provisions, have thus had an adverse effect on the revenue of our business historically, and may prevent
us from fully realizing the benefits of increases in our generation capacity and/or increases in the
market price for electricity in the future.

Unexpected cogeneration regulatory changes in Spain adversely impacted our results of operations.
For example, excluding the impact of the Spanish regulatory changes and applying 2012 conditions, our
EBITDA would have been A24 million and A33 million higher in 2013 and 2014, respectively.

Current regulatory requirements in the energy sector could continue to have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Furthermore,
unexpected regulatory changes may occur in the future resulting in similar detrimental effects.

**_We may incur liability and costs in connection with hazardous substances present at certain of our facilities._**

Some of our properties are located on land with a long history of industrial use by us and other
companies before us, which has resulted in spills and other release of hazardous materials over time.
The limited testing for contamination that has taken place at certain of our properties may not be
sufficient to ascertain the extent of our obligations with respect to any contamination relating to any of

31


-----

our facilities. Asbestos-containing materials (‘‘ACM’’) were formerly commonly used as building
materials such as insulation or tiling in industrial buildings. The use of ACM was standard practice
throughout the world until the late 1970s. Given the varying ages of our Spanish and French facilities,
we have identified ACM as being present at certain facilities. The laws of such jurisdictions can impose
liability on an owner or occupier of property for contamination at or emanating from the property,
regardless of who caused the contamination, when it was caused or whether the activity that caused the
contamination was legal at the time. We have incurred costs to investigate and remediate contamination
in the past and may in the future be subject to substantial costs and liabilities relating to
contamination.

Should we face claims relating to hazardous substances, we could incur significant costs defending
such claims or damages awards arising from them. Such expenses could have a material adverse effect
on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

**_Concerns about the effects of climate change may have an impact on our business._**

Concerns about global warming and carbon footprints, as well as legal and financial incentives
favoring alternative fuels, are causing the increased use of sustainable, non-fossil fuel sources for
electricity generation. Electricity generation companies are competing in the same markets as us for the
same raw materials we use in our paper production process, namely wood and wood chips, driving
prices for such materials upwards, especially during the winter in the Northern hemisphere.

Climate change could also cause the spread of disease and pestilence into our plantations and fiber
sources, far beyond their traditional geographic spreads, increasing the risk that the wood supply
necessary to our operations may be negatively impacted. If either of these phenomena intensifies,
additional costs or supply shortages could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition, results of operations and cash flows.

**_Substantially all of our employees are members of labor unions and we may face labor disruptions that could_**
**_interfere with our operations and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results_**
**_of operations._**

The majority of our employees are represented by labor unions under various collective bargaining
agreements in the different countries in which we operate. Upon the expiration of any existing
collective bargaining agreements, we may not be able to reach new agreements on terms satisfactory to
us without labor disruption. We could be affected by additional work stoppages or other labor actions.

Although management believes its relationship with employees is generally good, there can be no
assurance that there will not be labor disputes and/or adverse employee relations in the future.
Disruptions of business operations due to strikes or similar measures by our employees or the
employees of any of our significant suppliers could have a material adverse impact on our business,
financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

**_Changes in local regulations in relation to defined benefit post-employment plans and other employment_**
**_obligations may adversely affect our labor costs._**

We operate defined contribution pension plans and defined benefit pension plans for our
employees. Our long-term employee benefit provisions include, among others, obligations under
statutory pension plans and voluntary plans. Our long-term employee benefit provisions amounted to
A25.8 million as of March 31, 2016.

The cost of defined benefit pension plans and other post-employment benefits is determined using
actuarial valuations. Actuarial valuations involve making assumptions about discount rates, expected
rates of return on plan assets, future salary increases, mortality rates and future pension increases. Due
to the long-term nature of these plans, such estimates are subject to significant uncertainty. If actual
results, especially discount rates, expected rates of return on assets or mortality rates were to differ
from our assumptions, our pension obligations could be higher than expected and we could incur
actuarial gains and losses. Changes in all assumptions or under-performance of plan assets could also
adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

For defined benefit retirement plans, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the
projected unit credit method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date. We
recognize all actuarial gains and losses in equity and deferred taxes in the period in which they occur.

32


-----

Other costs are recognized in the income statement. Past services cost is recognized immediately to the
extent that the benefits are already vested, and otherwise is amortized on a straight-line basis over the
average period until the amended benefits become vested. Differences between estimated and actual
returns on plan assets can require us to record additional expenses. If invested pension plan assets
perform negatively or below assumptions, we would incur actuarial losses and we could have to revise
our assumptions. Future declines in the value of plan assets or lower-than expected returns may require
us to make additional current cash payments to pension plans or non-cash charges to our income
statement. Moreover, local funding rules might require us to provide for additional contributions to
avoid underfunding. Significantly increased contribution obligations could adversely affect our business,
financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

**_Our business is conducted under various administrative controls._**

Our operations are subject to the general supervision of various public administrative authorities,
including labor, tax and environmental authorities, as well as to extensive regulation of our business
and its impact on the environment, including with respect to carbon dioxide emissions. Such laws and
regulations require licenses, permits and other approvals to be obtained in connection with the
operation of our business. We are also required to purchase carbon dioxide emission credits
commensurate with our emissions, the price of which may significantly increase. We started making
payments for carbon dioxide emissions in the summer of 2015. In 2015, we paid approximately
A1 million for carbon dioxide emission credits. The regulatory framework to which we are subject
imposes significant actual, day-to-day compliance burdens, costs and risks on us. Non-compliance with
such regulations could result in the revocation of permits, sanctions, fines or even criminal penalties.
Compliance with regulatory requirements may result in substantial costs to our operations that may not
be recovered. In addition, we cannot predict the timing or form of any future regulatory or law
enforcement initiatives. Changes in existing energy, environmental and administrative laws and
regulations may materially and adversely affect our business, products, services, margins and
investments. Further, such changes in laws and regulations could increase the size and number of
claims and damages asserted against us or subject us to enforcement actions, fines and even criminal
penalties.

We believe that we manage our business in a manner that conforms to general practice in our
industry and that complies with applicable administrative rules, regulations and procedures. However,
we cannot assure you that our interpretation and application of such rules, regulations and procedures
will not differ from the views of the relevant public authorities as to their appropriate interpretation
and application. These public authorities may audit, review or inspect our activity.

To the extent any such audit, review or inspection reveals discrepancies between the interpretations
and applications made by us and those made by the relevant public authority, we may experience a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

**_Our insurance is limited and subject to exclusions._**

We operate a significant number of facilities. We currently have in place a number of different
insurance policies that cover property damage and losses due to the interruption of our business,
subject to customary conditions. We believe that this coverage is adequate to cover the risk of loss
resulting from any damage to our property or the interruption of any of our business operations.
However, the insurance policies are subject to limits and exclusions. There can be no assurance that
our insurance program would be sufficient to cover all potential losses and we may not be able to
obtain sufficient levels of property insurance coverage in the future or that such coverage will be
available on terms acceptable to us.

In addition, our insurance policies are subject to review by our insurers. If the level of premiums
were to increase in the future, we might not be able to maintain insurance coverage comparable to
those that are currently in effect at comparable cost, or at all. If we were unable to pass any increase in
insurance premiums on to our customers, such additional costs could have a material adverse effect on
our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Furthermore, we generally obtain trade credit insurance with respect to a large part of our trade
receivables. Although we generally extend trade credit only where such insurance is available, we in
certain cases will extend such trade credit where insurance cannot be obtained or cannot be obtained in
sufficient amounts. We cannot assure you that our efforts to insure our trade credit receivables will be

33


-----

effective to prevent losses in the event of our counterparties’ financial distress and that any such
financial distress will not result in reductions or cancellations or our existing policies. Any such trade
credit losses may be substantial and would negatively affect our results of operation and financial
position.

**_A fire, accident or other calamity at our facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business,_**
**_financial condition or results of operations._**

A fire, accident or other calamity resulting in significant damage to our facilities could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our operations
would be interrupted if any of our facilities were to experience a major accident or were forced to shut
down or curtail operations due to unforeseen events. Such incidents could result in delayed delivery
timetables and additional costs to us and there can be no assurance that our insurance coverage would
adequately cover all such costs, if at all, or that other funding would be available in such circumstances
to repair any unforeseen damage at our facilities. This could have a material adverse effect on the
quality of our products, the efficiency of our facilities and our business in general.

**_We rely on certifications by industry standard-setting bodies._**

We obtain and seek to adhere to certain certifications because we seek to conduct our activities
with respect to the environment and because certain of our customers have required us to obtain such
internationally recognized certifications for our products, or we comply on a voluntary basis because we
believe that it confers advantages on sellers who are so certified. We incur significant costs and
expenses to comply with and maintain our certifications, including assessments on a regular basis,
annual monitoring and implementation of record-keeping requirements. If we fail to maintain any of
our certifications, our business may be harmed because our customers that require or encourage such
certifications may cease buying products from us, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on
our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

**_Our operations could be adversely affected if we are unable to retain key employees._**

We depend on our senior management. Our performance and our ability to implement our
strategy depend on the efforts and abilities of our executive officers and key employees. Our operations
could be adversely affected if, for any reason, a number of these officers or key employees do not
remain with us. There may be a limited number of persons with the requisite skills to serve in these
positions and we may be unable to replace key employees with qualified personnel on acceptable terms.
In addition, our future success requires us to continue to attract and retain competent personnel.

**Risks Related to the Notes and Our Structure**

**_The Notes are secured only to the extent of the value of the Collateral that has been granted as security for the_**
**_Notes and the Guarantees. Such Collateral also secures the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and_**
**_certain hedging obligations and may in the future secure certain additional indebtedness permitted to be_**
**_incurred under the Indentures, including Pari Passu Debt. The value of the Collateral may not be sufficient_**
**_to satisfy the obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees._**

The holders of the Notes will be secured only by the Collateral. See ‘‘Description of the Notes—
Credit enhancement—Security.’’ The Collateral may also secure additional debt to the extent permitted
by the terms of the Indentures and the Revolving Credit Facility. Your rights to the Collateral may be
diluted by any increase in the first-priority debt secured by the Collateral or a reduction of the
Collateral securing the Notes. If there is an event of default on the Notes, there is no guarantee that
the value of the Collateral will be sufficient to enable the Issuer to perform its obligations under the
Notes. There is no requirement to provide funds to enhance the value of the Collateral if it is
insufficient. The proceeds of any sale of the Collateral following an event of default with respect to the
Notes may not be sufficient to satisfy, and may be substantially less than, amounts due on the Notes as
well as other indebtedness secured by the Collateral, including indebtedness under the New Revolving
Credit Facility and certain hedging obligations as well as Pari Passu Debt (as defined below).

The amount of proceeds realized upon the enforcement of the security interests over the Collateral
or in the event of liquidation will depend upon many factors, including, among others, whether or not
our business is sold as a going concern, the jurisdiction in which the enforcement action or sale is
completed, the ability to readily liquidate the Collateral, the availability of buyers and the condition of

34


-----

the Collateral, and exchange rates. Furthermore, there may not be any buyer willing and able to
purchase our business as a going concern, or willing to buy a significant portion of its assets in the
event of an enforcement action. The book value of the Collateral should not be relied on as a measure
of realizable value for such assets. Portions of the Collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily
ascertainable market value. In addition, the Collateral excludes leases that have a term of less than
30 years as well as intellectual property rights, licenses, contracts or agreements that by their express
terms limit the assignment thereof or the grant of a security interest thereunder, unless such consent
from the relevant third party can be obtained within the period and on the terms specified in the
relevant debenture. Some of these contracts may be material to the Issuer or the Guarantor or may be
necessary to operate essential facilities, or conduct its business operations and such exclusion or
termination could have a material adverse effect on the value of the Collateral or the ability to enforce
or realize it.

By its nature, some or all of the Collateral may not have a readily ascertainable market value or
may not be saleable or, if saleable, there may be substantial delays in its disposal. To the extent that
liens, security interests and other rights granted to other parties encumber assets owned by the Issuer
or the Guarantors, those parties have or may exercise rights and remedies with respect to the property
subject to their liens, security interests or other rights that could adversely affect the value of that
Collateral and the ability of the Trustee or investors as holders of the Notes to realize or enforce that
Collateral. If the proceeds of any sale of Collateral are not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the
Notes and the Guarantees, investors (to the extent not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the
Collateral) would have only an unsecured claim against the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ remaining
assets. Each of these factors or any challenge to the validity of the Collateral or the intercreditor
arrangement governing our creditors’ rights could reduce the proceeds realized upon enforcement of
the Collateral. In addition, there can be no assurance that the Collateral could be sold in a timely
manner, if at all. Proceeds from enforcement sales of capital stock and assets that are part of the
Collateral must first be applied in satisfaction of obligations under the New Revolving Credit Facility
and to counterparties under certain hedging obligations and thereafter towards repayment on a pari
_passu basis the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantor under the Notes. In addition, the_
Indentures will allow incurrence of certain additional permitted debt in the future that is secured by
the Collateral on a priority or pari passu basis. Such additional secured debt may be substantial. The
rights of a holder of Notes to the Collateral may be diluted by any increase in the debt secured by the
Collateral or a reduction of the Collateral securing the Notes.

To the extent that other first priority security interests, preexisting liens, liens permitted under the
Indentures and other rights encumber the Collateral securing the Notes, those parties may have or may
exercise rights and remedies with respect to the Collateral that could adversely affect the value of the
Collateral and the ability of the Security Trustee to realize or foreclose on the Collateral.

**_Our substantial indebtedness may make it difficult for us to service our debt, including the Notes, and to_**
**_operate our businesses._**

We have, and after the Offerings will continue to have, a significant amount of indebtedness. As of
March 31, 2016 and as adjusted to give effect to the Refinancing, Lecta S.A. and its subsidiaries would
have had A640.1 million of indebtedness, of which A600.0 million would have been represented by the
Notes. We anticipate that our substantial indebtedness will continue for the foreseeable future. Our
substantial indebtedness may have important negative consequences for you, including:

  - making it more difficult for us and our subsidiaries to satisfy our obligations with respect to
our debt, including the Notes and other liabilities;

  - requiring that a substantial portion of the cash flow from operations of our operating
subsidiaries be dedicated to debt service obligations, reducing the availability of cash flow to
fund internal growth through working capital and capital expenditures and for other general
corporate purposes;

  - increasing our vulnerability to economic downturns in our industry;

  - exposing us to interest rate increases;

  - placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt in
relation to cash flow;

35


-----

  - limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and our industry;

  - restricting us from pursuing strategic acquisitions or exploiting certain business opportunities;
and

  - limiting, among other things, our and our subsidiaries’ ability to borrow additional funds or
raise equity capital in the future and increasing the costs of such additional financings.

In the worst case, an actual or impending inability by us or our subsidiaries to pay debts as they
become due and payable could result in our insolvency.

In addition, the Indentures and the New Revolving Credit Facility contain restrictions that
substantially limit our financial and operational flexibility and that of our subsidiaries. In particular,
these agreements place limits on our ability to incur additional indebtedness, grant security interests to
third persons, dispose of material assets, undertake organizational measures such as mergers, changes
of corporate form, joint ventures or similar transactions, and enter into transactions with related
parties.

**_We require a significant amount of cash to service our debt and for other general corporate purposes. Our_**
**_ability to generate sufficient cash depends on many factors beyond our control._**

Our ability to make payments on our debt, and to fund working capital and capital expenditures,
will depend on our future operating performance and ability to generate sufficient cash. This depends,
to some extent, on general economic, financial, competitive, market, regulatory and other factors, many
of which are beyond our control, as well as the other factors discussed in these ‘‘Risk Factors’’ and
elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

Our business may not generate sufficient cash flows from operations, and additional debt and
equity financing may not be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debts when
due, including the Notes, or to fund our other liquidity needs. Our operational subsidiaries in Spain,
France and Italy are party to confirming agreements pursuant to which banks pay our suppliers on
delivery of products and we in turn pay banks at the agreed date. In addition, certain subsidiaries are
party to financing arrangements that will become due and need to be refinanced or repaid prior to
maturity of the Notes, including Alto Garda Power S.r.L. (A18.7 million outstanding as of March 31,
2016; matures December 31, 2020) and IDAE Sant Joan AIE (A10.0 million outstanding as of
March 31, 2016; matures September 30, 2018). The termination of any of these agreements could
adversely affect our ability to satisfy our working capital and other liquidity needs, and in turn could
have a material effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. For a
discussion of our cash flows and liquidity, see ‘‘Operating and Financial Review and Prospects—
Liquidity and Capital Resources.’’

If our future cash flows from operations and other capital resources are insufficient to pay our
obligations as they mature or to fund our liquidity needs, we may be forced to:

  - reduce or delay our business activities and capital expenditures;

  - sell assets;

  - obtain additional debt or equity financing; or

  - restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the Notes, on or before
maturity.

We may not be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely basis or on satisfactory
terms, if at all. In addition, the terms of our debt, including the New Revolving Credit Facility and the
Notes, and any future debt that we may incur, may limit our ability to pursue any of these alternatives.

**_Lecta S.A. is a holding company and is dependent on payments from its subsidiaries in order to be able to_**
**_make payments on the Notes, and Lecta S.A.’s subsidiaries may not be permitted or otherwise able to make_**
**_payments to Lecta S.A._**

Lecta S.A. is a holding company that conducts all of its operations through holding companies and
their operating subsidiaries. Other than the equity of Sub Lecta S.A. and its rights under the
Intercompany Loans, Lecta S.A. does not have any significant assets and does not, and will not,
conduct any revenue-generating operations. Lecta S.A. will therefore be dependent upon the cash flow

36


-----

from its subsidiaries and the receipt of funds from them in the form of dividends, other distributions or
intercompany loans in order to make cash payments on the Notes or other obligations.

In addition, even if our subsidiaries generate sufficient cash from their operations, their ability to
provide funds to Lecta S.A. is subject to, among other things, local tax restrictions and local corporate
law restrictions related to earnings, level of legal or statutory reserves, losses from previous years and
capitalization requirements for our subsidiaries. As a result, although we may have sufficient resources,
on a consolidated basis, to meet our obligations, our subsidiaries may not be able to make the
necessary transfers to us to permit us to satisfy our obligations under the Notes or otherwise. For
example, local law restricts our subsidiaries’ ability to provide funds to Lecta S.A. in the following ways:

  - restrictions under Luxembourg company law which require dividends to be distributed out of
distributable reserves. Interim dividends distribution by a public limited liability company is
subject to strict conditions. A board of directors’ resolution approving an interim dividend
distribution must be passed. Interim accounts dated no more than 2 months before the board
of directors’ resolution must be drawn up by the board of directors, showing available
distributable reserves and results for the current interim period. The amount to be distributed
may not exceed total profit made since the end of the last financial year (for which the annual
accounts have been approved), plus any profit carried forward and sums drawn from reserves
available for this purpose, less losses carried forward and any sums to be placed in reserve
pursuant to the requirements of Luxembourg company law or of the articles of incorporation
and by-laws of the company. A report of the statutory auditor must be issued, confirming that
the legal conditions for an interim dividends distribution have been satisfied;

  - capital redemption or capital reduction is also subject to strict conditions under Luxembourg
company law which may restrict or delay Sub Lecta S.A. or the Issuer in making certain
payments or delay Sub Lecta S.A. in providing funds to the Issuer;

  - restrictions under the Italian Civil Code which require, among other things, each of our Italian
subsidiaries to retain at least 5% of its annual net profits in a legal reserve (riserva legale) until
the reserve reaches at least 20% of such company’s share capital;

  - restrictions under French company law which require to distribute only the profits legally
available, which consist of (i) the profits for the financial period less the losses brought
forward, less (ii) the sums to be placed in reserve pursuant to French law or the articles of
association of the French company, plus (iii) any retained earnings. Regarding the reserve,
each of our French subsidiaries has, pursuant to French law, to retain at least 5% of its
benefits in a legal reserve (r´eserve l´egale) until the reserve reaches at least one-tenth of such
company’s share capital; and

  - restrictions under Spanish corporate law which require, among other things, each of our
Spanish subsidiaries to retain at least 10% of its annual net income in a legal reserve until the
reserve reaches at least 20% of such company’s share capital and that, after payment of any
dividend, shareholders’ equity (after subtracting goodwill and start-up expenses) must exceed
the company’s share capital.

**_Not all of our subsidiaries will guarantee the Notes, and any claim by us or any of our creditors, including_**
**_the holders of the Notes, against such non-Guarantor subsidiaries will be structurally subordinated to all of_**
**_the claims of creditors of those non-Guarantor subsidiaries._**

Not all of our existing and future subsidiaries will guarantee the Notes. On a consolidated basis as
of March 31, 2016, we had total assets of A1,247.5 million and total debt of A643.9 million. In the
twelve months ended March 31, 2016, Lecta S.A. and the Guarantors had aggregate unconsolidated
EBITDA of A90.6 million. This represented 80% of the Issuer’s consolidated EBITDA for the same
period. The Indentures do not limit the transfer of assets to, or the making of investments in, any of
our restricted group members, including our non-guarantor subsidiaries. See ‘‘Description of the
Notes—Certain Covenants.’’ Accordingly, non-guarantor subsidiaries could account for a higher portion
of our assets, liabilities, revenue and net income in the future. As of March 31, 2016, our
non-Guarantor subsidiaries had A33.4 million of indebtedness. In addition, any non-guarantor
subsidiaries may incur debt under the Indentures, in certain circumstances, and any such debt would be
structurally senior relative to claims of the holders of the Notes.

37


-----

As of March 31, 2016, indebtedness of non-Guarantor subsidiaries included the financing
arrangements of Alto Garda Power S.r.L. (i) an interest-bearing cash advance in the form of declared
but unpaid dividends owed to its shareholders in an amount of A4.0 million as of March 31, 2016
(principal and accrued interest as of March 31, 2016: A4.5 million) and certain facilities in an aggregate
committed amount of up to A66 million (principal and accrued interest as of March 31, 2016:
A18.7 million); and (ii) IDAE Sant Joan with respect to a A11 million revolving credit facility (with a
cap declining until maturity of the facility on September 30, 2018) (principal and accrued interest as of
March 31, 2016: A10.0 million).

In the event that any of our non-guarantor subsidiaries becomes insolvent, liquidates, reorganizes,
dissolves or otherwise winds up, the assets of such non-guarantor subsidiary will not be subject to
claims from the holders of the Notes to satisfy their respective credits against us and will be used first
to satisfy the claims of the non-guarantor subsidiary’s creditors, including trade creditors, banks and
other lenders. Consequently, any claim by us or our creditors, including holders of the Notes, against a
non-guarantor subsidiary will be structurally subordinated to all of the claims of the creditors of such
non-guarantor subsidiary.

**_We may under certain circumstances secure our debt with security interests in assets other than the Collateral_**
**_and the claims of holders of the Notes will be effectively subordinated to the rights of any such future secured_**
**_creditors to the extent of the value of the non-Collateral assets securing such debt._**

The Notes and the Guarantees will be secured by the Collateral but the Indentures will allow the
Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries to incur ‘‘Permitted Liens’’ securing certain debt without providing
a similar security interest with respect to the Notes and the Guarantees. Permitted Liens include those
securing, among other things, hedging obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business, debt of a
newly-acquired subsidiary existing at the time of the acquisition, capital leases, recourse factoring, and
debt incurred under the ‘‘Credit Facility’’ Permitted Debt provision. See ‘‘Description of the Notes—
Certain covenants—Limitation on Debt.’’ Such secured debt will be effectively senior to the Notes and
the Guarantees to the extent of the value of the assets that secure such debt. Specifically, the financing
arrangements with respect to the Alto Garda Power S.r.L. co-generation plant are secured with liens
over the shares and assets of Alto Garda Power S.r.L., which assets do not form part of the Collateral.
In the event of any distribution or payment of our assets in any foreclosure, dissolution, winding-up,
liquidation, administration, reorganization or other insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding, the proceeds
from the sale of assets securing any such secured debt will be available to pay obligations on the Notes
only after all such secured indebtedness has been paid in full. As a result, holders of the Notes may
receive less, ratably, than holders of such secured indebtedness.

**_Creditors under the New Revolving Credit Facility and certain hedging debt are entitled to be repaid with the_**
**_proceeds of collateral sold in any enforcement sale in priority to the holders of Notes._**

The obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees are secured on a first-ranking basis with
security interests over Collateral which also secures our obligations under the New Revolving Credit
Facility and certain hedging obligations (the ‘‘Super Senior Liabilities’’). The Indentures also permit the
Collateral to be pledged to secure additional indebtedness permitted to be incurred and secured,
including on an equal and ratable basis or subordinate or junior to the Notes and the Guarantees, in
accordance with the terms thereof and the Intercreditor Agreement.

Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, the Super Senior Liabilities will have priority over any
amounts received from the sale of the Collateral pursuant to an enforcement action taken with respect
to the Collateral. As such, in the event of a foreclosure of the Collateral, you may not be able to
recover on the Collateral if the then outstanding claims under the Super Senior Liabilities are greater
than the proceeds realized. Any proceeds from an enforcement sale of the Collateral by any creditor
will, after all Super Senior Liabilities have been discharged from such recoveries, be applied pro rata in
repayment of the Notes and any other obligations secured by the Collateral on a pro rata basis. The
Intercreditor Agreement provides that a common Security Trustee, who will also serve as the security
agent for the lenders under the New Revolving Credit Facility, our hedging obligations and any
additional secured debt permitted to be incurred by the Indentures whose representative accedes as a
party to the Intercreditor Agreement, will act only as provided for in the Intercreditor Agreement.

In general, there are limitations on the ability of holders of the Notes to take enforcement action
with respect to the Collateral, including a specified consultation period that is required to be observed

38


-----

before enforcement action can commence. If any of the lenders under the New Revolving Credit
Facility, the holders of the Notes or the creditors of future debt (‘‘Pari Passu Debt’’) equal in ranking to
the Notes and with equal-ranking security interests in the same Collateral and whose representative
accedes as a party to the Intercreditor Agreement (the ‘‘Pari Passu Holders’’) wishes to instruct the
Security Trustee to take enforcement action with respect to the Collateral, the party or parties wishing
to provide such instructions must consult among one another and the Security Trustee for 30 days (or
such period as agreed among them) with a view to coordinating the enforcement instructions. In the
event of conflicting instructions, the parties providing or entitled to provide instructions must consult
for a further 15 days (or such period as agreed among them) with a view to resolving the conflict. The
Security Trustee will take enforcement action with respect to the Collateral only if so instructed by the
holders of the Notes/Pari Passu Holders, unless either no such liabilities remain outstanding or six
months have elapsed since any of the lenders under the New Revolving Credit Facility, the holders of
the Notes or Pari Passu Holders took enforcement action with respect to an event of default under the
applicable agreement, in which case the instructions of the lenders under the New Revolving Credit
Facility shall prevail. No such consultation periods shall be required if the Collateral has become
enforceable due to insolvency proceedings or if the delay entailed by the consultation period would
impair the ability of the Security Trustee to enforce the Collateral or impair the realization of proceeds
from such enforcement.

In the event of conflicting instructions from the holders of the Notes and the Pari Passu Holders,
then either the instructions of the holders of the Notes will prevail if the outstanding amount of the
Notes is equal to or greater than the outstanding amount of the Pari Passu Debt, or the instructions of
the Pari Passu Holders will prevail if the outstanding amount of the Pari Passu Debt is equal to or
greater than the outstanding amount of the Notes. The instructions of the holders of the Notes will in
any event prevail if the outstanding amount of the Pari Passu Debt is less than A50 million.

For additional details regarding the ability of holders of the Notes to enforce, see ‘‘Description of
Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement.’’

**_The value of the Collateral may decrease because of obsolescence, impairment or certain casualty events._**

The value of the properties that the Issuer and the other Guarantors own or lease and the real
estate serving as Collateral may be adversely affected by depreciation and normal wear and tear or
because of certain events that may cause damage to these properties. Although the Security Documents
contain certain covenants in relation to the maintenance and preservation of assets, the Issuer and the
Guarantors are not required to improve the Collateral. The Issuer is obligated under the Security
Documents to maintain insurance with respect to the Collateral, but the proceeds of such insurance
may not be sufficient to rebuild or restore such properties to their original condition prior to the
occurrence of the events that caused the insured damages. Those insurance policies will most certainly
not cover all the events that may conceivably result in damage to the Collateral.

**_The Issuer and the Guarantors have control over the Collateral securing the Notes, and the sale of particular_**
**_assets could reduce the pool of assets securing the Notes._**

The Security Documents allow the Issuer and the Guarantors to remain in possession of, retain
exclusive control over, freely operate, and collect, invest and dispose of any income from the Collateral
securing the Notes. So long as no default or event of default under the Indentures would result
therefrom, the Issuer and the Guarantors may, among other things, without any release or consent by
the Security Trustee, conduct ordinary course activities with respect to the Collateral, such as selling,
factoring, abandoning or otherwise disposing of Collateral and making ordinary course cash payments,
including repayments of indebtedness.

**_It may be difficult to realize the value of the Collateral securing the Notes._**

The Collateral securing the Notes and the Guarantees is subject to any and all exceptions, defects,
encumbrances, liens and other imperfections permitted under the Indentures and/or the Intercreditor
Agreement and accepted by other creditors that have the benefit of first-priority security interests in
the Collateral securing the Notes from time to time, whether on or after the date the Notes are first
issued. The existence of any such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections
could adversely affect the value of the Collateral securing the Notes, as well as the ability of the
Security Trustee to realize or foreclose on such Collateral. Furthermore, the first-priority ranking of

39


-----

security interests can be affected by a variety of factors, including, among others, the timely satisfaction
of perfection requirements, statutory liens or recharacterization under the laws of certain jurisdictions.

The security interests of the Security Trustee will be subject to practical problems generally
associated with the realization of security interests over real or personal property such as the Collateral.
For example the Security Trustee may need to obtain the consent of a third party to enforce a security
interest. We cannot assure you that the Security Trustee will be able to obtain any such consents. We
also cannot assure you that the consents of any third parties will be given when required to facilitate a
foreclosure on such assets. Accordingly, the Security Trustee may not have the ability to foreclose upon
those assets, and the value of the Collateral may significantly decrease.

In addition, we are required to register our various operations with national regulators. Such
requirements may prohibit foreclosure on our share capital or may require us to incur significant cost
and expense due to such requirements. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that any applicable
governmental authorities will consent to such action. If any regulatory approvals that are required are
not obtained or are delayed, the foreclosure may be delayed, a temporary shutdown of operations may
result and the value of the Collateral may be significantly decreased.

**_The security interests in the Collateral are granted to the Security Trustee rather than directly to the holders of_**
**_the Notes._**

The security interests in the Collateral that secure the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes
and the obligations of the Guarantors under the Guarantees are not granted directly to the holders of
the Notes but are granted only in favor of the Security Trustee. The Indentures provide (along with the
Intercreditor Agreement) that only the Security Trustee has the right to enforce the Security
Documents. As a consequence, holders of the Notes will not have direct security interests and will not
be entitled to take enforcement action in respect of the Collateral securing the Notes, except through
the Trustee, who will (subject to the provisions of the Indentures) provide instructions to the Security
Trustee in respect of the Collateral.

**_The ability of the Security Trustee to enforce the Collateral may be restricted by local law._**

Under Luxembourg law, the validity, legality, performance and enforceability of the Collateral is
subject to, and may be affected or limited by, the provisions of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
liquidation, moratorium or reprieve from payment (sursis de paiement), controlled management (gestion
_contrˆol´ee), general settlement or composition with creditors (concordat pr´eventif de faillite), fraudulent_
conveyance, reorganization or similar Luxembourg or foreign laws affecting the rights of creditors
generally and thus the ability of the Security Trustee to enforce the Collateral may be restricted.

Under Italian law there is some uncertainty (a) if the beneficial owners of the Notes that are not
identified as registered holders in the pledge agreement will be deemed to have a valid and perfected
security interest under such pledge and (b) with respect to the validity of any security interest created
in favor of the Security Trustee under the Notes on behalf of the holders of the Notes. In addition, the
enforceability of Italian law-governed security interest granted in favor of the creditor of a parallel debt
is uncertain and has not been tested before the Italian courts and, accordingly, the Italian law governed
security interest does not secure the ‘‘parallel debt obligations’’. If any challenge to the validity,
perfection or enforceability of the security interests created by the pledges or the validity of the parallel
debt structure were successful, the holders of the Notes may be unable to recover any amounts under
the pledges.

Also, under Italian law, in the event that the relevant obligor enters into insolvency, liquidation or
other analogous proceedings, the pledges could be subject to potential challenges by an insolvency
administrator or by other creditors of such obligor under the rules of avoidance or clawback of Italian
insolvency laws and the relevant law on the non-insolvency avoidance or clawback of transactions by the
debtor.

Under French law, a pledge over shares may be enforced at the option of the Security Trustee
either (i) by means of a sale of the pledged shares in a public auction (the proceeds of the sale being
paid to the secured creditors and any excess over the amount of the secured debt being paid to the
legal owner of the collateral) or (ii) by attribution judiciaire or conventionnelle of the shares in favor of
the secured creditor, following which the secured creditor becomes the legal owner of the pledged
shares. In foreclosure proceedings under option (ii), an expert values the collateral (in this case, the

40


-----

shares) and, if the expert determines that the value of the collateral exceeds the amount of secured
debt, the secured creditor may be required to pay the obligor an amount (soulte) equal to the
difference between the value of the shares as determined by the expert and the amount of the secured
debt. This is true regardless of the actual amount of proceeds ultimately received by the secured
creditor from a subsequent sale of the pledged shares.

As a result, if the Security Trustee enforces the Collateral pursuant to option (i), the proceeds of
the sale of the Collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy the claims of all secured creditors. If the
Security Trustee enforces the Collateral pursuant to option (ii), there is a risk that the secured creditors
may not be able to sell the Collateral for its full value as determined by the court-appointed expert, yet
still be required to pay the pledgor, at the time the Security Trustee becomes the legal owner of the
Collateral, the difference between the value of the Collateral and the amount of the secured debt if the
Collateral is determined by the court-appointed expert to have a greater value than the amount of the
secured debt.

In addition, as there is currently no established concept of ‘‘trust’’ or ‘‘trustee’’ under French law,
the precise nature, effect and enforceability of the duties, rights and powers of a security agent as
trustee for holders of the Notes in respect of security interests such as pledges are uncertain under
French law. A concept of fiduciary agent (fiduciaire) was recently incorporated in French law, but the
effects of such incorporation on the recognition of foreign law-governed ‘‘trusts’’ are not yet clear.

For more information, see ‘‘Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the
Security Interests.’’

**_There are circumstances other than repayment of the Notes under which the Guarantees of a Guarantor will_**
**_terminate and release automatically without your consent or the consent of the Trustee._**

Under various circumstances, the Guarantees of a Guarantor will terminate and release, including,
without limitation, upon:

  - a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of capital stock of
the relevant Guarantor or of a parent thereof (other than the Issuer), such that such
Guarantor ceases to be a ‘‘Restricted Subsidiary’’ (as defined in the Indentures), or the sale or
disposition of all or substantially all the assets of the relevant Guarantor, in each case in a
transaction otherwise permitted by the Indentures;

  - the designation in accordance with the Indentures of the relevant Guarantor as an
‘‘Unrestricted Subsidiary’’ (as defined in the Indentures);

  - defeasance or discharge of the Notes, as provided in the Indentures;

  - as described under the caption ‘‘Description of the Notes—Amendments and Waivers’’; or

  - in connection with certain enforcement actions taken by the creditors under the Intercreditor
Agreement.

**_The Collateral may be released without the consent of the holders of the Notes._**

The Collateral may be released in certain circumstances, including in the event the collateral is
sold pursuant to an enforcement sale in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement. If such
Collateral consists of all of the shares of a Guarantor, than such Guarantor’s Guarantee will also be
released under such circumstances. See ‘‘Description of the Notes—Credit enhancement—Release of
Guarantees’’ and ‘‘Description of the Notes—Credit enhancement—Release of Collateral.’’

Additionally, the Indentures permit us to release and retake the security interest granted over the
Collateral in certain circumstances, including in order to issue additional Notes pursuant to the
Indentures. In such circumstances, there may be a time period imposed by applicable laws between the
release and retaking of the security interest during which there is no security interest over the
Collateral. In some circumstances, such as if we filed for bankruptcy after the issuance of additional
Notes, a hardening period may apply and retroactively void the retaking of the security interest in favor
of the holders of the Notes. Accordingly, there is a risk that, should we issue additional Notes pursuant
to the Indentures, the Collateral could be released and its subsequent retaking voided. See
‘‘Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Impairment of security interest.’’

41


-----

**_Despite our current substantial indebtedness, we may be able to incur more debt in the future, including on a_**
**_secured basis over the Collateral or otherwise, which could further exacerbate the risks of our indebtedness._**

We may incur more debt in the future. The New Revolving Credit Facility provides for total
commitments of up to A65.0 million and includes an uncommitted accordion feature that would enable
the facility to be increased by up to A15.0 million. We do not currently expect to draw any amount
under the New Revolving Credit Facility as of the Issue Date. The Indentures will limit our ability to
incur additional debt but will not prohibit us from doing so. We may incur additional debt in the
future, secured by the Collateral or otherwise, that could mature prior to the Notes, and such debt
could be secured on an equal, ratable and pari passu basis with the Notes and the Guarantees.

**_The Guarantees are significantly limited by applicable laws and are subject to certain limitations or defenses._**

The Guarantors will guarantee the payment of the Notes as described in ‘‘Description of the
Notes—Credit enhancement—Guarantees.’’ The Guarantees provide the holders of the Notes with a
direct claim against the relevant Guarantor. However, the obligations of each Guarantor under its
Guarantee will be limited under the Indentures to an amount which has been determined so as to
ensure that amounts payable will not result in violations of laws relating to corporate benefit,
capitalization, capital preservation, financial assistance or transactions under value, or otherwise cause
the Guarantor to be deemed insolvent under applicable law or such Guarantee to be deemed void,
unenforceable or ultra vires, or cause the directors of such Guarantor to be held in breach of applicable
corporate or commercial law for providing such Guarantee.

As a result, a Guarantor’s liability under its Guarantees could be materially reduced or eliminated
depending upon the amounts of its other obligations and upon applicable laws. In particular, in certain
jurisdictions, a guarantee issued by a company that is not in that company’s corporate interests or the
burden of which exceeds the benefit to the company may not be valid and enforceable. It is possible
that a Guarantor, a creditor of a Guarantor or the insolvency administrator, in the case of an
insolvency of a Guarantor, may contest the validity and enforceability of the respective Guarantee and
that the applicable court may determine that the Guarantee should be limited or voided. In the event
that any Guarantee is deemed invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, or to the extent that
agreed limitations on the Guarantee apply, the Notes would be effectively subordinated to all liabilities
of the applicable Guarantor, including trade payables of such Guarantor.

We expect that the maximum principal amount of Guarantees to be provided by certain of the
Guarantors on the Issue Date will be determined based on the valuation of the Guarantor, and will be
no less than the following amounts: Garda: A32.0 million; Condat Holding S.A.S.: A23.8 million;
Condat S.A.S.: A23.8 million; Torraspapel S.A.: A588.2 million; and Polyedra S.p.A.: A3.0 million.

For more information on the specific limitations under applicable law of the respective jurisdictions
of incorporation of the Guarantors and certain contractual limitations to be confirmed in the
Indentures, see ‘‘Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security
Interests’’ and Annex A hereto.

**_Fraudulent conveyance laws may limit your rights as a holder of Notes._**

Although laws differ among various jurisdictions, in general, under fraudulent conveyance laws, a
court could subordinate or void a Guarantee if it found that:

  - the Guarantee was incurred with actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud creditors or
shareholders of the Guarantor; or

  - the Guarantor did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value for the
Guarantee and the Guarantor:

  - was insolvent or was rendered insolvent because of the Guarantee;

  - was undercapitalized or became undercapitalized because of the Guarantee; or

  - intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, debts beyond its ability to pay at maturity.

The measure of insolvency for purposes of fraudulent conveyance laws varies depending on the law
applied. Generally, however, a Guarantor would be considered insolvent if it could not pay its debts as
they become due. If a court decided that any Guarantee was a fraudulent conveyance and voided such
Guarantee, or held it unenforceable for any other reason, you would cease to have any claim in respect

42


-----

of the Guarantor of such Guarantee and would be a creditor solely of Lecta S.A. and the remaining
Guarantors. See ‘‘Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security
Interests.’’

**_Local insolvency laws may not be as favorable to you as U.S. bankruptcy laws or those insolvency laws of_**
**_another jurisdiction with which you may be more familiar._**

Lecta S.A. is incorporated in Luxembourg, and the Guarantors are organized under the laws of
Luxembourg, Italy, France and Spain. The insolvency laws of some or all of these other jurisdictions
may not be as favorable to holders of the Notes as the laws of the United States or some other
jurisdictions. Moreover, there may be a risk that an Intercompany Loan may be equitably subordinated
to the claims of the trade creditors of the obligor under such Intercompany Loan upon the bankruptcy
of such obligor. Payments made under an equitably subordinated loan preceding the bankruptcy of an
obligor may in certain circumstances be clawed back.

**_Enforcing your rights as a holder of Notes or under the Guarantees across multiple jurisdictions may prove_**
**_difficult._**

The Notes will be issued by Lecta S.A., which is organized under the laws of Luxembourg, and
guaranteed by the Guarantors, which are organized under the laws of Luxembourg, France, Italy or
Spain, as the case may be. In the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency or similar event, proceedings could
be initiated in any or all of these jurisdictions. Such multijurisdictional proceedings are likely to be
complex and costly for creditors and may result in greater uncertainty and delay regarding the
enforcement of your rights. Your rights under the Notes and the Guarantees will potentially be subject
to the insolvency and administrative laws of several jurisdictions, and there can be no assurance that
you will be able to effectively enforce your rights in such circumstances.

In addition, the bankruptcy, insolvency, administrative and other laws of the various Guarantors’
jurisdictions of organization may be materially different from, or in conflict with, each other, including
in the areas of rights of creditors, priority of government and other creditors, ability to obtain
post-petition interest and duration of the proceedings. The application of these laws, or any conflict
among them, could call into question whether any particular jurisdiction’s law should apply, could
adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights under the Notes and the Guarantees in these
jurisdictions, and could limit any amounts that you may receive.

**_You may face foreign exchange risks by investing in the Notes, which risk may be increased if the euro no_**
**_longer exists or if the Notes are otherwise redenominated as a result of member states leaving the Eurozone._**

The Notes will be denominated and payable in euro. If investors measure their investment returns
by reference to a currency other than euro an investment in the Notes will entail foreign exchange
related risks due to, among other factors, possible significant changes in the value of the euro relative
to the currency by reference to which the investor measures the return on his or her investments
because of economic, political and other factors over which we have no control. Depreciation of the
euro against the currency by reference to which an investor measures the return on his or her
investments could cause a decrease in the effective yield of the Notes below their stated coupon rates
and could result in a loss to the investor when the return on the Notes are translated into the currency
by reference to which such investor measures the return on their investments. Investments in the Notes
denominated in a currency other that U.S. dollars by United States investors may also have important
tax consequences as a result of foreign exchange gains or losses. See ‘‘Tax Considerations—Certain U.S.
Federal Income Tax Consequences’’.

Despite the measures taken by countries in the Eurozone to alleviate credit risk, concerns persist
regarding the debt burden of certain Eurozone countries and their ability to meet future financial
obligations, the overall stability of the euro and the suitability of the euro as a single currency given the
diverse economic and political circumstances in individual Eurozone member states. These and other
concerns could lead to the reintroduction of individual currencies in one or more Eurozone member
states, or, in more extreme circumstances, the possible dissolution of the euro entirely. Should the euro
dissolve entirely, the legal and contractual consequences for holders of euro-denominated obligations
would be determined by laws in effect at such time. The official exchange rate at which the Notes may
be redenominated may not accurately reflect their value in euro. These potential developments, or

43


-----

market perceptions concerning these developments and related issues, could adversely affect the value
of the Notes.

**_We may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance a change of control offer and certain_**
**_events which might otherwise constitute a change of control may not trigger a requirement for us to_**
**_repurchase the Notes if our Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio is above a certain threshold._**

Upon the occurrence of certain change of control events as described in the Indentures we will be
required to offer to repurchase all of the Notes in cash in an amount equal to 101% of the principal
amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of repurchase. See ‘‘Description of
the Notes—Change of Control.’’ We may not have sufficient funds at the time of any such event to
make the required repurchases. Additionally, certain change of control events would be prepayment
events under the New Revolving Credit Facility. In the event this results in an event of default
thereunder, the lenders under the New Revolving Credit Facility may accelerate such debt, which could
also cause an event of default under the Indentures.

The change of control provision contained in the Indentures may not necessarily afford you
protection in the event of certain important corporate events, including a reorganization, restructuring,
merger or other similar transaction involving us that may adversely affect you, because such corporate
events may not involve a shift in voting power or beneficial ownership, or may involve affiliates of or
investors in funds managed by our principal shareholder. In addition, the occurrence of certain events
that might otherwise constitute a change of control under the Indentures will be deemed not to be a
change of control if our ratio of net debt as of the most recent balance sheet date to EBITDA over the
most recently completed four fiscal quarters is above a certain threshold pro forma for the change of
control transaction. See ‘‘Description of the Notes—Change of Control’’; ‘‘Description of the Notes—
Certain Definitions—Change of Control’’ and ‘‘Description of the Notes—Certain Definitions—
Permitted Holders.’’

The source of funds for any repurchase required as a result of any such event will be available
cash or cash generated from operating activities or other sources, including borrowings, sales of assets
and sales of equity or funds provided by subsidiaries. Sufficient funds may not be available at the time
of any such events to make any required repurchases of the Notes tendered.

**_You may be unable to enforce judgments against us, the Guarantors, or our respective directors and officers._**

Neither Lecta S.A. nor any of the Guarantors are incorporated within the United States. In
addition, substantially all of the Group’s assets are outside the United States and all of the Group’s
directors and officers live outside the United States. Lecta S.A.’s and the Guarantors’ auditors are also
organized outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult or impossible to serve process
against any of these persons in the United States. Furthermore, as all or substantially all of the assets
of these persons are located outside of the United States, it may not be possible to enforce judgments
obtained in courts in the United States predicated upon civil liability provisions of the federal securities
laws of the United States against these persons. Additionally, there is doubt as to the enforceability in
Luxembourg, Italy or Spain of civil liabilities based on the civil liability provisions of the securities laws
of the United States. See ‘‘Service of Process and Enforcement of Civil Liabilities.’’

**_Our controlling shareholder may have interests that conflict with those of holders of Notes._**

Circumstances may occur in which the interests of our controlling shareholder could be in conflict
with your interests. For example, the interests of our controlling shareholder could conflict with your
interests if we faced financial difficulties and were unable to comply with our obligations to you under
the Notes. In addition, our equity investors may have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures
and other transactions which, in their judgment, could enhance their equity investment, even though
such transactions might involve risks to you. Conversely, our controlling shareholders or our minority
shareholders may have an interest in not pursuing acquisitions, divestitures and other transactions that
could enhance our cash flow and be beneficial to you. Moreover, our controlling shareholder is in the
business of making investments in companies and may, from time to time, acquire and hold interests in
businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us.

**_If Spanish tax authorities determine that interest payments that any Spanish Guarantor makes should be_**
**_treated as Spanish source income, withholding rules could apply and we could be required to gross-up any_**
**_such payments for the amount of any required withholding._**

We have been advised that under applicable Spanish tax rules, all payments of principal and
interest made under the Guarantees should be made free and clear of any withholding or deduction of
any taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges of any nature whatsoever which may be
imposed, levied, collected, withheld or assessed by the Kingdom of Spain or any political subdivision or
authority thereof or therein. There is no clear precedent, statement of law or regulation to support this
position, however, and the Spanish tax authorities may determine that, under certain circumstances,
payments by a Spanish Guarantor to holders of Notes should be treated as Spanish source income
subject to a 19% withholding tax on such payments. See ‘‘Tax Considerations—Spanish Taxation’’ for a
more detailed explanation.

If such withholding tax were imposed on any payments by any Spanish Guarantor, we may be
required under the Indentures to gross-up any such payments to cover the full amount of the taxes
required to be withheld, subject to certain exceptions described in ‘‘Description of the Notes—
Additional Amounts.’’ If we are required to gross-up payments under the Guarantee, the amounts we
would be required to gross-up could be substantial and could materially adversely affect our financial
condition and results of operations.

**_There is no existing public trading market for the Notes and the ability to transfer them is limited, which may_**
**_adversely affect the value of the Notes._**

The Notes are a new issue. There is no existing trading market for the Notes and there can be no
assurance that a trading market for the Notes will develop. We cannot predict the extent to which
investor interest in our company will lead to the development of an active trading market or how liquid
that trading market might become. Although the Initial Purchasers have advised us that they intend to
make a market in the Notes, they are not obligated to do so and may stop at any time. The market
price of our Notes may be influenced by many factors, some of which are beyond our control,
including:

  - changes in demand, the supply or pricing of our products;

  - general economic conditions, including raw material prices;

  - the activities of competitors;

  - our quarterly or annual earnings or those of our competitors;

  - investor perceptions of us and the CWF industry;

  - the failure of securities analysts to cover our Notes after this Offering or changes in financial
estimates by analysts;

  - the public’s reaction to our press releases or our other public announcements;

  - future sales of Notes; and

  - other factors described under these ‘‘Risk Factors.’’

As a result of these factors, you may not be able to resell your Notes at or above the initial
offering price. In addition, securities trading markets experience extreme price and volume fluctuations
that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of a particular
company. These broad market fluctuations and industry factors may materially reduce the market price
of our Notes, regardless of our operating performance. If an active trading market does not develop,
you may have difficulty selling any Notes that you buy.

The Notes have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act or any U.S.
securities laws and we have not undertaken to effect any exchange offer for the Notes in the future.
You may not offer the Notes for sale in the United States except pursuant to an exemption from, or a
transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and applicable state
securities laws, or pursuant to an effective registration statement. The Notes and the Indentures will
contain provisions that will restrict the Notes from being offered, sold or otherwise transferred except
pursuant to the exemptions available pursuant to Rule 144A and Regulation S, or other exceptions
under the U.S. Securities Act. Furthermore, we have not registered the Notes under any other country’s

securities laws. It is your obligation to ensure that your offers and sales of the Notes within the United
States and other countries comply with applicable securities laws. See ‘‘Notice to Investors.’’ In
addition, by its acceptance of delivery of any Notes, the holder thereof agrees on its own behalf and on
behalf of any investor accounts for which it has purchased notes that it shall not transfer the Notes in
an amount less than A100,000.

**_We may incur additional tax liabilities as a result of our operations in the various countries in which we_**
**_conduct business._**

We may be exposed to unforeseen additional taxes that are identified through future tax audits or
other review actions of the relevant tax authorities, which could lead to an increase in our tax
obligations. This may result from either a tax payment being levied directly on us or indirectly where
we become liable as a secondary obligor for a primary obligor’s failure to pay (for example, an
employee’s failure to pay). Tax authorities in Luxembourg, France, Italy, Spain and other European
jurisdictions are routinely challenging corporate transactions, including financings such as the issue of
the Notes. Any future tax audit may require us to pay additional taxes (including any accrued interest
and penalties).

**_The Notes will initially be held in book-entry form, and therefore you must rely on the procedures of the_**
**_relevant clearing systems to exercise any rights and remedies._**

Unless and until Notes in definitive registered form (‘‘Definitive Registered Notes’’) are issued in
exchange for book-entry interests (which may occur only in very limited circumstances), owners of
book-entry interests will not be considered owners or holders of Notes. The common depositary (or its
nominee) for Euroclear and Clearstream will be the sole registered holder of the Global Notes.
Payments of principal, interest and other amounts owing on or in respect of the relevant Global Notes
representing the Notes will be made to Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, as paying agent, which
will make payments to the common depositary, who will then make payments to Euroclear and
Clearstream. Thereafter, these payments will be credited to participants’ accounts that hold book-entry
interests in the Global Notes representing the Notes and credited by such participants to indirect
participants. After payment to the common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, none of the
Issuer, the Guarantors, the Trustee or the Paying Agent will have any responsibility or liability for the
payment of interest, principal or other amounts to the owners of book-entry interests. Accordingly, if
you own a book-entry interest in the Notes, you must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and
Clearstream and, if you are not a participant in Euroclear and/or Clearstream, on the procedures of the
participant through which you own your interest, to exercise any rights and obligations of a Holder of
the Notes under the Indentures.

Unlike the holders of the Notes themselves, owners of book-entry interests will not have any direct
rights to act upon any solicitations for consents, requests for waivers or other actions from holders of
the Notes. Instead, if you own a book-entry interest, you will be permitted to act only to the extent you
have received appropriate proxies to do so from Euroclear and Clearstream or, if applicable, from a
participant. There can be no assurance that procedures implemented for the granting of such proxies
will be sufficient to enable you to vote on any matters or on a timely basis.

Similarly, upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Indentures, unless and until the
relevant Definitive Registered Notes are issued in respect of all book-entry interests, if you own a
book-entry interest, you will be restricted to acting through Euroclear and Clearstream. We cannot
assure you that the procedures to be implemented through Euroclear and Clearstream will be adequate
to ensure the timely exercise of rights under the Notes.

**USE OF PROCEEDS**

The gross proceeds from the Offerings will be A600.0 million. This includes proceeds from the
issuance of (i) the Floating Rate Senior Secured Notes (without giving effect to the issue price of 99%)
of A225.0 million and (ii) the Fixed Rate Senior Secured Notes of A375.0 million.

We intend to use the net proceeds of the Offerings, together with cash on our balance sheet as of
the Issue Date, to satisfy and discharge the Existing Notes and to pay certain fees and expenses in
connection with the Refinancing. See ‘‘Summary—The Transactions and Use of Proceeds—The
Refinancing.’’

The expected estimated sources and uses of the funds necessary to consummate the Refinancing
are shown in the table below. Actual amounts may vary from estimated amounts depending on several
factors, including the difference between actual and estimated existing cash in the business, the actual
and estimated cost of satisfying and discharging the Existing Notes and actual and estimated fees and
expenses.

You should read ‘‘Capitalization’’ and ‘‘Description of Other Indebtedness’’ for a more detailed
description of the expected use of proceeds and our capitalization and financing arrangements.

**OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW AND PROSPECTS**

_The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and the_
_notes thereto included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. We have prepared our financial statements_
_for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015 and for the three months ended March 31, 2015_
_and 2016 in accordance with IFRS-EU. The discussion contained herein is based on the Audited_
_Consolidated Financial Information and the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Information._

**Overview**

We are one of the leading European manufacturers and distributors of specialty papers for labels
and flexible packaging, premium coated paper for wide format advertising, high quality publishing and
commercial printing, along with other high value-added paper products. We have an annual production
capacity of 258,000 metric tons of labels and flexible packaging and 231,000 metric tons of UWF and
base paper. We are also the largest CWF manufacturer in Southern Europe, with an annual production
capacity of 1,135,000 metric tons in 2015. We own and operate a 234,000 metric ton pulp mill in Spain,
which provides approximately 30% of our overall pulp requirements. We have ten paper machines in
seven mills located at various sites in Italy, France and Spain. In the twelve months ended March 31,
2016, our mills produced an aggregate of 298,000 metric tons of specialty papers and UWF and
1,142,000 metric tons of CWF.

In addition, we operate a substantial paper distribution business that we have built organically and
through the acquisitions of Malmenayde in France in 2008 and Polyedra in Italy in 2012. In the twelve
months ended March 31, 2016, we distributed 535,000 metric tons of paper, of which 134,000 metric
tons were produced by third parties. We plan to expand our distribution business with selected and
opportunistic bolt-on acquisitions to expand our presence in other countries.

For CWF, we rank first in terms of market share in France and Spain, and second in Italy, the
principal markets for our products, which accounted for 17%, 13% and 16%, respectively, of our paper
deliveries by volume in 2015. We also market our CWF elsewhere in Europe, including
Germany (13%), the United Kingdom (8%) and other Western European countries (9%), Eastern
Europe (4%), and, to a lesser extent, outside of Europe. Our mills are located in close proximity to the
key commercial markets in Western Europe. These markets account for approximately 70% of demand
for CWF in Europe and approximately 75% of our total sales in 2015.

During the twelve months ended March 31, 2016, our revenue (consisting of sales of paper and
energy) were A1,474.3 million. During the same period we had Adjusted EBITDA of A119.6 million and
an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 8.1%.

We were formed by CVC Capital Partners (‘‘CVC’’) in 1997 through the acquisition of Cartiere
del Garda of Italy in October of that year, and we subsequently acquired Condat of France in
November 1998 and Torraspapel of Spain in December 1999, all three of which are long-established
paper manufacturing companies.

We have a high-quality asset base, which achieves superior operating performance. Between 1999
and 2015, we invested approximately A1.0 billion in rebuilding our papermaking, coating and converting
machines, increasing our co-generation capabilities, reducing costs, improving productivity, enhancing
our information technology, implementing environmental and safety improvements and maintenance.
We have reduced both our variable and fixed costs through machine modernization and various cost
reduction initiatives, including the coordination of sales and marketing, and raw material purchases,
and extensive internal and external benchmarking of our production processes. Additionally, we have
invested in efficient energy production activities and reduction in greenhouse-gas emissions, and
currently benefit from six co-generation plants with total installed capacity of 271 MW.

**Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations**

**_Cyclicality in the Paper Industry_**

Our results of operations have been affected significantly by cyclicality in the paper industry.
Long-term demand for paper is driven by global economic trends, demographic trends, technological
developments and trends in end-user preferences. Although historically consumption of paper by
end-users has increased steadily, customer demand for paper has fluctuated significantly, suggesting that
customer demand is driven by a combination of end-user consumption and changes in the inventory
levels that customers maintain. Profitability in the paper industry is highly sensitive to changes in prices,
and industry profit cycles reflect the constantly shifting balance between supply and demand for
individual products, as well as changes in inventory levels. Periods of industry-wide investment in new
production capacity or significant contractions in demand due to weak economic conditions have in
previous industry cycles led to decreases in product prices, often as a result of excess capacity. This
cyclicality in the industry is exacerbated by the customer practice of leveraging inventory capacity,
pursuant to which customers aim to build inventories in anticipation of increases in paper prices and
then satisfy end-user demand from their inventories when paper prices are high. As a result, the
financial performance of the industry has historically deteriorated during periods of oversupply only to
improve when either demand has increased or supply has been reduced to a level that supports the
implementation of price increases.

In 2015, the European deliveries declined by 2.0% to 5.3 million metric tons compared to
5.4 million metric tons in 2014 and were stable compared to 2013 with European deliveries amounting
5.3 million metric tons in 2013, according to Euro-Graph. Demand for CWF fell by 2.3% in 2015,
according to Euro-Graph. Germany, the UK, France, Italy and Spain are the main markets, accounting
for 70% of deliveries in Europe. We estimate that the global demand for CWF industry was
approximately 24 million metric tons in 2015.

As a result of these challenging market conditions in the past decade, significant capacity has been
closed in Europe. Between 2006 and 2015, capacity for 4.1 million metric tons has been closed, with
Lecta alone accounting for approximately 350,000 metric tons of the reduced capacity.

In 2014 and 2015, plant closures and restructurings were announced by European paper producers.
Scheufelen, one of our competitors, announced the closure of one of its two production lines at its
Oberlenningen mill in Germany in December 2014, reducing CWF production capacity by 160,000
metric tons per year. Sappi, another one of our competitors, announced the closure of its Nijmegen
mill in the Netherlands in January 2015, reducing CWF production capacity by 240,000 metric tons per
year. Arjowiggins, another of our competitors, announced the closure of its Wizernes mill in France in
June 2015, reducing CWF production capacity by 140,000 metric tons per year. These closures, totaling
approximately 540,000 metric tons per year of capacity, represent approximately 7% of the total
Western European CWF production capacity in 2014. In addition, there have been a number of
announcements of progressive capacity reductions, such as those in Metsa Husum (Sweden).

We estimate that five producers of CWF (Sappi (24%), UPM (18%), Lecta (17%), Stora Enso
(16%) and Burgo (12%)) currently account for approximately 87% of the European CWF production
capacity. We believe that paper producers will continue to pursue a strategy of capacity rationalization,
closing down less-efficient, high-cost mills, if required.

**_Raw Materials and Energy Costs_**

Pulp and energy represent our primary input costs. Wood pulp is the principal raw material
required to manufacture paper. We purchase approximately 70% of our pulp requirements, producing

the remainder of our needs at our pulp mill in Spain. The price of pulp is highly volatile and sensitive
to changes in wood prices, industry capacity, producer inventories, demand for paper, and cyclical
changes in the world economy and fluctuations in the U.S. dollar, the reference currency for trading in
wood pulp. Fluctuations in pulp prices may impact, in turn, prices of final paper products.

Energy is also an important input cost for manufacturing paper and related transport costs. The
price of crude oil impacts oil-based raw materials and transportation costs. During the period under
review, the price of crude oil has been highly volatile. Moreover, we have a limited ability to pass
through pulp price increases to our customers. In addition, changes in Spanish energy legislation in
2013 and 2014 had a significant impact on our results of operations. For more information, see ‘‘Risk
Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Regulatory changes have affected our business historically
and any future changes may have an adverse effect on our electricity generating activities.’’

For internal reporting purposes we account for revenue derived from the sale of excess electricity
and from the sale of hot water as a reduction of our total energy bill.

**_Cost-Savings Measures and Efficiency of Operations_**

Paper producers have a high proportion of fixed costs, and as a result, fluctuations in prices and
volumes for paper products cause corresponding fluctuations in the profitability of paper
manufacturers. As the paper industry is highly competitive, paper producers must focus on achieving
greater efficiency and cost control to improve their competitive positions. To that end, we have
undertaken a number of cost-savings measures in recent years, such as investing in the modernization
of our paper machines and sharing best practices among our mills to enhance the efficiency of our
production by reducing our fixed costs.

We reduced overall labor costs by 7% between 2013 and 2015, primarily as a result of an overall
reduction in headcount by approximately 14%. These actions were achieved through the following
measures:

  - _Operational integration of Garda, Condat and Torraspapel: The integration helped to reduce the_
Group’s subsidiaries’ production, logistics and distribution costs while allowing the Group to
achieve market growth by adapting to market evolution and strengthening its relationships
with customers.

  - _Significant production reorganization: Production was significantly reorganized through targeted_
headcount reductions, mill restructuring and closures, CWF production homogenization, the
interchangeability of production among different mills and investment in co-generation with
the aim of reducing energy dependency on third parties. In 2013, we closed Condat’s
production line n�6 in France (which had a CWF production capacity of 130,000 metric tons)
and in January 2014, we closed the Berrobi-Uranga mill (which had a paper production
capacity of 27,000 metric tons) and the Sarri`a de Ter mill and its co-generation plant (which
had a paper production capacity of 65,000 metric tons and 25 MW of power, respectively).
Moreover, Lecta converted 60,000 metric tons of CWF capacity in Motril and Zaragoza
toward the production of 1-side coated and base paper.

  - _Optimization of our activities: In 2013, we outsourced the transportation activity of our_
distributor in France in order to turn fixed costs into variable costs and closed three
distribution warehouses in Italy. In 2014, we further restructured our distribution business with
the closure of one warehouse in France. In 2015, we outsourced the non-core activities of the
Sant Joan mill.

  - _Optimization of sales organization: This included the full integration of Garda, Condat and_
Torraspapel and the centralization and merger of sales offices.

  - _Resource efficiency at operational sites: We reuse the paper waste generated during the_
production process in our mills.

  - _Implementation of performance based compensation: To reduce labor costs, we introduced_
partial variable salaries indexed to performance of the company at Cartiere del Garda.
Further group-wide alignment of employee incentives and reduction in fixed labor costs was
achieved by linking bonuses to EBITDA.

**_Effect of Currency Fluctuations_**

Our sales are denominated principally in euro and are also denominated in pounds sterling, U.S.
dollars and other currencies. Our principal raw material, pulp, is a commodity priced in U.S. dollars.
Our other costs are predominantly denominated in euro. As a consequence, we are structurally net
buyers of U.S. dollars. As such, all other things being equal, a weakening of the U.S. dollar by 1%
should have a positive impact on our EBITDA of A1.6 million. However, the U.S. dollar price of pulp
and the euro price of paper are correlated to the U.S. dollar such that in the long run, a weakening of
the U.S. dollar exerts downward pressure on euro paper prices and upward pressure on pulp prices.

We have a policy of hedging our foreign exchange exposure on non-euro-denominated sales and
purchases once they are committed. We only hedge a low portion of our projected foreign exchange
flows.

**_Impact of Changes in Energy Legislation_**

Changes in energy regulation affects the prices at which we can buy and sell energy, and thereby
reducing our revenue or increasing our costs derived from such sales or purchases. In 2013 and 2014,
the change in Spanish energy legislation significantly impacted our results of operations. Excluding the
impact of the Spanish regulatory changes and applying 2012 conditions, our EBITDA would have been
A24 million and A33 million higher in 2013 and 2014, respectively.

For the three months ended March 31, 2015, we had revenue of A376.1 million, versus
A359.2 million in the three months ended March 31, 2016, a decrease of A16.9 million. Such decrease
resulted from lower sales volumes of CWF, specialty papers and trading goods of A9.9 million, or 3%,
from A353.5 million in the three months ended March 31, 2015 to A343.7 million in the three months
ended March 31, 2016. This was partially offset by an increase in average net sales price of A8/t, or 1%,
from A895/t in the three months ended March 31, 2015 to A903/t in the three months ended March 31,
2016.

Energy sales decreased by A7 million, or 31%, from A22.5 million in the three months ended
March 31, 2015 to A15.5 million in the three months ended March 31, 2016. Such decrease resulted
from a decrease in average net sales price of A28/MWh, or 34%, from A83/MWh in the three months
ended March 31, 2015 to A55A/MWh in the three months ended March 31, 2016 but was partially offset
by higher sales volumes of 11,800 MWh, or 4%, from 270,489 MWh in the three months ended
March 31, 2015 to 282,309 MWh in the three months ended March 31, 2016. Energy sales are allocated
between CWF and specialty papers depending on whether the energy was produced at a co-generation
facility connected to a mill principally producing CWF or specialty papers.

The following table presents revenue by geographical location from external customers of our
products and services for the three months ended March 31, 2015 and March 31, 2016:

_Raw Materials and Consumables Used_

The costs of raw materials and consumables used increased by A4.7 million, or 3%, from
A184.1 million in the three months ended March 31, 2015 to A188.7 million in the three months ended
March 31, 2016. As a percentage of revenue, such costs increased from 48.9% in the three months
ended March 31, 2015 to 52.5% in the three months ended March 31, 2016. The absolute increase was
mainly attributable to higher purchased volumes and an increase in the average purchase price of pulp
of A21/t from the three months ended March 31, 2015 to the three months ended March 31, 2016.

_Labor Costs_

Labor costs decreased by A0.4 million, or 1%, from A48.2 million in the three months ended
March 31, 2015 to A47.8 million in the three months ended March 31, 2016, and, as a percentage of
revenue, they increased from 12.8% in the three months ended March 31, 2015 to 13.3% in the three

months ended March 31, 2016. The headcount decreased by 80 employees from 3,395 employees in the
three months ended March 31, 2015 to 3,315 employees in the three months ended March 31, 2016.

_Other Operating Costs Except Non-Recurring Items_

Other operating costs except non-recurring items decreased by A11.5 million, or 10%, from
A110.6 million in the three months ended March 31, 2015 to A99.2 million in the three months ended
March 31, 2016, and, as a percentage of revenue, they decreased from 29.4% in the three months
ended March 31, 2015 to 27.6% in the three months ended March 31, 2016. The absolute decrease was
mainly due to lower energy, distribution and overhead costs, partially offset by an increase in packaging
materials, outsourcing, selling variable, maintenance and production consumables costs.

_EBITDA_

EBITDA increased by A3.4 million, or 12%, from A28.5 million in the three months ended
March 31, 2015 to A31.9 million in the three months ended March 31, 2016. This increase was
attributable to lower net energy, distribution, labor and overhead costs, as a result of higher unit gross
margin but was partially offset by lower sales volumes of paper and higher costs of packaging materials,
outsourcing, selling variable, maintenance and production consumables costs.

_Depreciation and Amortization_

Depreciation and amortization decreased by A0.5 million, or 4%, from A14.1 million in the three
months ended March 31, 2015 to A13.6 million in the three months ended March 31, 2016.

_Non-Recurring Items_

In the three months ended March 31, 2015 and March 31, 2016 we recorded non-recurring charges
of A1.2 million and A2.1 million, respectively. These charges were due to the organization efficiency
program.

_Finance Costs_

Finance costs increased by A0.1 million, or 1%, from A16.7 million in the three months ended
March 31, 2015 to A16.8 million in the three months ended March 31, 2016.

_Income Tax_

In the three months ended March 31, 2016, we recorded an income tax charge of A1.0 million,
compared to an income tax charge of A1.1 million in the three months ended March 31, 2015.

**_Year Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014_**

**_Breakdown of Revenue_**

The chart below shows the breakdown by product type of consolidated volumes of 1,565.2 and
1,601.7 metric tons of paper sold to third parties for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014,
respectively, and the breakdown by product type of our revenue of A1,491.1 million and A1,490.8 million
for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The chart does not take into account
the revenue from our sales of excess energy produced by the co-generation facilities we operate, which
is sold to third parties and is reflected in our total revenue.

_Raw Materials and Consumables Used_

The costs of raw materials and consumables used increased by A18.1 million, or 2.5%, from
A735.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2014 to A753.1 million in the year ended December 31,
2015. As a percentage of revenue, such costs increased from 49.3% in the year ended December 31,
2014 to 50.5% in the year ended December 31, 2015. Although lower volumes raw materials and
consumables were purchased, the absolute increase was attributable to an increase in the average
purchase price of pulp of A84/t from the year ended December 31, 2014 to in the year ended
December 31, 2015.

_Labor Costs_

Labor costs decreased by A10.0 million, or 4.9%, from A203.4 million in the year ended
December 31, 2014 to A193.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2015, and, as a percentage of
revenue, they decreased from 13.6% in the year ended December 31, 2014 to 13.0% in the year ended
December 31, 2015. The absolute decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in the average
headcount of 287 employees from 3,650 employees in the year ended December 31, 2014 to 3,363
employees in the year ended December 31, 2015.

_Other Operating Costs Except Non-Recurring Items_

Other operating costs except non-recurring items decreased by A8.9 million, or 2.0%, from
A443.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2014 to A434.7 million in the year ended December 31,
2015, and, as a percentage of revenue, they decreased from 29.8% in the year ended December 31,
2014 to 29.2% in the year ended December 31, 2015. The absolute decrease was mainly due to lower
energy, packaging materials, variable selling and production consumables costs, partially offset by higher
outsourcing, distribution, maintenance and overhead costs.

_EBITDA_

EBITDA increased by A9.3 million, or 9.3%, from A100.3 million in the year ended December 31,
2014 to A109.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2015. This increase was attributable to lower
net energy costs, costs of packaging materials, sales, variable, labor and production consumables, offset
by lower sales of paper in volume, higher outsourcing, distribution, maintenance and overheads costs,
leading to a lower unit gross margin. EBITDA in the year ended December 31, 2015 was adversely
affected by the bankruptcy of three subsidiaries of one of our major customers during 2015, the impact
of which management, taking into account the protective measures put in place, estimated at
A6.5 million.

_Depreciation and Amortization_

Depreciation and amortization decreased by A3.1 million, or 5.2%, from A59.4 million in the year
ended December 31, 2014 to A56.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2015.

_Non-Recurring Items_

In the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded a non-recurring charge of A3.1 million. This
was due to a A9.0 million organization efficiency program charge, partially offset by a capital gain of
A5.9 million on the sale of tangible assets.

In the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded a non-recurring charge of A11.5 million
attributable to restructuring cash costs of A14.1 million, partially offset by a reversal of tangible assets
impairment of A3.9 million.

_Finance Costs_

Finance costs decreased by A0.5 million, or 0.6%, from A68.3 million in the year ended
December 31, 2014 to A67.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2015.

_Income Tax_

In the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded an income tax charge of A3.6 million,
compared to A27.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2014.

For the year ended December 31, 2014, we had revenue of A1,490.8 million, versus A1,585.0 million
in the year ended December 31, 2013, a decrease of A94.2 million, or 6%. This decrease was primarily
attributable to a decrease of A69.9 million, or 5%, in sales of CWF, Specialties and Trading goods, from
A1,465.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2013 to A1,395.9 million in the year ended
December 31, 2014. Such decrease resulted from lower sales volumes of 53,149 metric tons, or 3%,
from 1,654,886 metric tons in the year ended December 31, 2013 to 1,601,737 metric tons in the year
ended December 31, 2014, and a decrease in average net sales price of 14A/t, or 2%, from 886A/t in the
year ended December 31, 2013 to 872A/t in the year ended December 31, 2014.

The decrease in product sales described above was also attributable to a decrease in sales of
energy of A24.3 million, or 20%, from A119.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2013 to
A94.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2014. Such decrease resulted from lower sales volumes of
96,093 MWh, or 8%, from 1,255,445 MWh in the year ended December 31, 2013 to 1,159,352 MWh in

the year ended December 31, 2014, combined with lower average net sales price of 13A/MWh, or 14%,
from 95A/MWh in the year ended December 31, 2013 to 82A/MWh in the year ended December 31,
2014. Energy sales are allocated between CWF and specialty papers depending on whether the energy
was produced at a co-generation facility connected to a mill principally producing CWF or specialty
papers.

_Raw Materials and Consumables Used_

The costs of raw materials and consumables used decreased by A45.5 million, or 6%, from
A780.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2013 to A735.0 million in the year ended December 31,
2014. As a percentage of revenue, such costs remained largely stable at 49.2% in the year ended
December 31, 2013 and 49.3% in the year ended December 31, 2014. The absolute decrease was
attributable to lower purchased volumes, and a decrease in the average consumption price of pulp of
31A/t from the year ended December 31, 2013 to the year ended December 31, 2014.

_Labor Costs_

Labor costs decreased by A3.9 million, or 2%, from A207.3 million in the year ended December 31,
2013 to A203.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2014, but, as a percentage of revenue, they
increased from 13.1% in the year ended December 31, 2013 to 13.6% in the year ended December 31,
2014. The absolute decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in the average headcount of 281
employees from 3,931 employees in the year December 31, 2013 to 3,650 employees in the year
December 31, 2014, partially offset by a one-off reduction for the provision for defined benefit
post-employment plans of A9.5 million booked in September 2013, following the termination of the
Progil pension regime to active employees and the reduction of the provision for Retirement plan IFC,
both in Condat S.A.S.

_Other Operating Costs Excluding Non-Recurring Items_

Other operating costs except non-recurring items decreased by A49.1 million, or 10%, from
A492.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2013 to A443.6 million in the year ended December 31,
2014, and, as a percentage of revenue, they decreased from 31.1% in the year ended December 31,
2013 to 29.8% in the year ended December 31, 2014. The absolute decrease was mainly due to lower
costs of energy, packaging materials, outsourcing, distribution, variable selling, maintenance, production
consumables and overhead costs in 2014 compared to 2013.

_EBITDA_

EBITDA increased by A10.1 million, or 11.2%, from A90.2 million in the year ended December 31,
2013 to A100.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2014. This increase was attributable to lower
costs of packaging materials, outsourcing, distribution, variable selling, labor, maintenance, production
consumables and administration overheads, offset by lower sales of paper in volume and higher net
energy costs, in a context of lower unit gross margin. During 2013, we benefitted from a one-off
reduction of A9.5 million in labor costs (resulting from the termination of the Progil pension regime to
active employees and the reduction of the provision for Retirement plan IFC, both in Condat S.A.S.) in
the year ended December 31, 2013.

_Depreciation and Amortization_

Depreciation and amortization decreased by A10.1 million, or 15%, from A69.5 million in the year
ended December 31, 2013 compared to A59.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2014. This
decrease was mainly attributable to the closure of Condat S.A.S.’s production line 6 in July 2013 and of
the Berrobi / Uranga and Sarri`a de Ter plants in 2014.

_Non-Recurring Items_

In the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded a non-recurring charge of A11.5 million
attributable to restructuring cash costs of A14.1 million, partially offset by a reversal of tangible assets
impairment of A3.9 million.

In the year ended December 31, 2013, we recorded non-recurring charge of A50.4 million, related
to a tangible assets impairment of A30.0 million, restructuring cash costs of A16.9 million and a
A2.5 million capital loss resulting from the sale of Torraspapel Argentina SA.

_Finance Costs_

Finance costs were relatively stable at A68.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2013 and
A68.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2014 but, as a percentage of revenue, they increased
from 4.3% in the year ended December 31, 2013 to 4.6% in the year ended December 31, 2014.

_Income Tax_

In the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded an income tax charge of A27.8 million,

  - payments related to non-recurring items of A1.4 million in relation to organization efficiency
program costs; and

  - income tax paid of A0.4 million, of which A0.2 million was related to the CICE tax credit in
France (a corporate income tax credit for certain labor costs in France) in order to offset the
deduction of that same amount from our labor costs for the three months ended March 31,
2016 as the CICE tax credit had not been collected as at 31 March 2016.

During the three months ended March 31, 2016, our cash flows used in investing activities were
A12.7 million, A7.0 million less than our cash flows used in investing activities during the three months

  - proceeds from disposal of property, plant and equipment of A0.8 million; and

  - receipt of grant of A2.2 million in relation to white and green certificates in order to
neutralize the profit booked in ‘‘Other operating costs except non-recurring items’’ above
EBITDA, as the cash was not collected as at March 31, 2016.

During the three months ended March 31, 2016, our cash flows used in financing activities were
A11.3 million, A2.9 million more than our cash flows used in financing activities during the three

and uses of cash in operating activities were:

  - EBITDA of A100.3 million;

69


-----

  - a decrease in working capital of A15.4 million mainly due to a decrease in inventories of
A15.8 million, in trade receivables of A3.7 million and in prepayments of A0.4 million, partially
offset by a reduction in trade payables of A4.6 million;

  - payments related to non-recurring items of A18.3 million, primarily relating to organization
efficiency program costs; and

  - income tax paid of A8.0 million.

During the year ended December 31, 2014, our cash flows used in investing activities were
A47.4 million, A7.5 million less than our cash flows used in investing activities during the year ended
December 31, 2013. Our principal use of cash in investing was purchases of property, plant and
equipment of A55.1 million. It was partly offset by the receipt of grants in an amount of A7.0 million.

During the year ended December 31, 2014, our cash flows used in financing activities were
A73.9 million, A0.8 million more than our cash flows used in financing activities during the year ended
December 31, 2013. Our principal uses of cash in financing were:

  - dividends paid to non-controlling interests of A0.9 million;

  - interest paid of A64.0 million;

  - the repayment of borrowings net of proceeds from borrowings of A7.8 million; and

  - payment of finance leases liabilities of A0.8 million.

**_Capital Resources_**

Our total capital resources consist of total equity and non-current interest-bearing borrowings. As
of March 31, 2016, total equity amounted to A132.0 million and non-current interest-bearing borrowings
as of March 31, 2016 to A608.0 million, compared to A147.7 million and A613.8 million, respectively, as
of March 31, 2015. In addition, current interest-bearing borrowings amounted to A20.0 million as of
March 31, 2016, compared to A16.8 million as of March 31, 2015.

**_Capital Expenditures and Investments_**

In the three months ended March 31, 2016, capital expenditures were A11.5 million, primarily
related to major paper machine repairs, cost reduction and productivity improvement, maintenance,
information technology, environment and safety, and a decrease in capital payables.

In 2015, capital expenditures were A45.3 million, and included A8.3 million for major paper
machine repairs, A10.8 million for cost reduction and productivity improvement, A19.3 million for
maintenance, A4.3 million for information technology, A2.9 million for environment and safety, and an
increase in capital payables of A0.3 million.

In 2014, capital expenditures were A55.7 million, and included A6.7 million for major paper
machine repairs, A34.9 million for cost reduction and productivity improvement, A13.8 million for
maintenance, A1.6 million for information technology, A4.2 million for environment and safety, and a
decrease in capital payables of A5.6 million.

In 2013, capital expenditures were A44.1 million, and included A16.0 million for cost reduction and
productivity improvement, A15.4 million for maintenance, A1.5 million for information technology,
A10.0 million for environment and safety, and a decrease in capital payables of A1.3 million.

Going forward, we expect our average annual maintenance capital expenditure (i.e., capital
expenditure required to maintain the operating performance of our mills and co-generation plants) to
be between A25 million and A35 million. We will undertake any additional, non-maintenance capital
expenditure only where we believe such capital expenditure would be accretive to our EBITDA. For
example, we are initiating an upgrade of our IT systems, which we expect to complete over the next
three years. We expect to incur capital expenditures of approximately A16 million in respect of this
project over such period.

(1) Our operating leases consist of commercial leases of office buildings, warehouses and small fittings (such as copy machines).
We enter into operating leases where we conclude that it is not in our best interests to purchase these assets.

(2) The contractual obligations included in the above table include accrued interest or outstanding purchase obligations. The
outstanding purchase obligations are entered into in the normal course of business.

**_Employee Benefits_**

We currently operate defined contribution pension plans and defined benefit pension plans for our
employees.

Our long-term employee benefit provisions primarily comprise obligations under our pension plans,
death and disability plans, staff-leaving indemnities and long-term service awards. Our long-term
employee benefit provisions amounted to A25.8 million as of March 31, 2016, compared to A26.9 million
as of March 31, 2015.

**_Capital Commitments_**

As of March 31, 2016, we had firm commitments due to purchase orders of property, plant and
equipment net of advances to suppliers of A12.8 million. These commitments consisted of A3.5 million
in Italy for the renewal of the press section in paper machine No. 2; A0.4 million in France; and
A8.9 million in Spain, mainly in relation to the increase in our specialty papers production capacity and
the renewal of the central server.

**_Contingent Liabilities_**

We are involved from time to time in legal proceedings and other claims that arise in the normal
course of business. In the judgment of management, no losses in excess of provisions made or covered
by insurance programs which would be material in relation to our financial position are likely to arise
in respect of these matters, although their occurrence may have a significant effect on periodic results.
See ‘‘Business—Legal Proceedings.’’

**Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements**

We do not believe that off-balance sheet arrangements are likely to have a current or future effect
on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenue or expenses, results of operations,
liquidity, capital expenditure or capital resources that would be material.

**Financial Risk Management**

**_Foreign Exchange Risk_**

Our operations are impacted by the fluctuations of non-euro currencies, primarily pounds sterling
and U.S. dollars. This foreign currency exposure includes foreign currency-denominated sales and
purchases. Sales and purchases are hedged through forward agreements and options.

The following table sets forth the main types of foreign exchange derivative agreements that we
use, and their values as of March 31, 2016:

**Value as of**
**March 31, 2016**
**(in millions of euro)**
Forward agreements on realized sales in foreign currencies . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 26.4
Forward agreements on realized purchases in foreign currencies . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 7.9
Options on future sales in foreign currencies . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . —
Options on future purchases in foreign currencies . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . —

**_Interest Rate Risk_**

Our profit before tax is exposed to fluctuations of interest rates, as a vast proportion of our
borrowings is indexed to the three-month EURIBOR. An increase of 1% (100 basis points) of the
three-month EURIBOR (e.g., from �0.02% to 0.98%), based on actual figures in 2015, would have
resulted in an unfavorable impact on profit before tax of approximately A3.2 million.

The interest rates for a portion of our senior debt are typically hedged according to EURIBOR
three-month collars, caps, floors or similar instruments. As of March 31, 2016, we have hedged
A300.0 million of our Floating Rate Senior Secured Notes due 2018 using interest rate caps. See
Note 16 to our interim condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Offering
Memorandum.

**_Commodity Risk_**

We currently do not hedge against the fluctuations of raw material and energy prices. See ‘‘Risk
Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Product prices and raw material costs in our industry are
volatile, and periods of low product prices or high raw material costs negatively affect our profitability
and cash flows.’’

**_CO2 Emission Rights Risk_**

Our CO2 emissions exceed the amount of CO2 emission rights granted for free. We cover this
deficit with the stock of emission rights available at the end of the prior period and with the purchase
of emission rights from third parties. The price of CO2 emission rights is subject to market fluctuations,
and we currently do not hold any derivatives to hedge against fluctuations in the purchase price of
emission rights. As of December 31, 2015, we estimate that a price increase of A1 per ton of CO2
emission rights would unfavorably affect our EBITDA by A0.4 million.

**INDUSTRY AND MARKET OVERVIEW**

The paper industry is generally divided into three sectors: Graphic Papers, Packaging and
Sanitary & Household. The segment of the paper industry in which we compete is Graphic Papers, and
more specifically CWF and specialty papers (on which we have a growing focus). The papermaking
process is relatively similar for all kinds of paper, with variations for different paper products based
primarily on the type of pulp used and the existence or absence of coatings.

**Specialty Papers**

Specialty paper markets are typically characterized by value added products and high margins.
These markets are served by a relatively small number of competitors, who compete on the basis of
brand, quality and service.

The specialty papers business encompasses a wide range of products aimed at more diverse
markets and smaller volume applications than CWF. The following is an overview of the principal types
of specialty papers that we produce:

_Self-Adhesive._ Self-adhesive paper has a self-adhesive coating on one side and a surface suitable
for printing on the other. Self-adhesive paper is used primarily for printing labels for a broad range of
resilient, consumer facing end-uses, including food, beverage, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics.

Increased use of labels is being driven by new consumption habits and regulatory changes such as
food safety and legislation requiring larger labels and relabeling of existing products, the rise of
pre-cooked and pre-labelled meals at supermarkets, and the increase of variable information labels
driven by Internet purchases. According to FINAT, demand for self-adhesive paper in Europe grew at a
CAGR of 3.3% from 2010 to 2015. According to Alexander Watson Associates (AWA), the CAGR
2014-2019 in Europe of the pressure-sensitive label market is estimated to be around 2.6%.

The European self-adhesive paper market is relatively consolidated, with a small number of
competitors representing a significant portion of production capacity. We estimate that, in 2015, the top
five European producers of self-adhesive paper accounted for approximately 79% of European
self-adhesive paper production capacity, with Lecta having the sixth largest capacity.

_Metalized._ Metalized paper has a thick deposit of metalized particles that resemble a layer of foil.
Metalized paper offers reduced stiffness and increased flexibility and is used for labels, cigarette
packets, luxury packaging, gift wrapping and self-adhesive labels.

Demand for metalized paper is strongly linked to beer and tobacco demand. While tobacco
consumption is decreasing in developed countries, opportunities exist in developing countries as well as
in the substitution of aluminum foil. Expectations are positive for continued growth in beer demand,
with metalized paper being used to differentiate premium and super premium brands from mainstream
brands. In addition, the share of metalized papers in flexible and FMCG packaging is currently limited
and is an opportunity for growth.

We estimate that, in 2015, the top five European producers of metalized paper accounted for
approximately 76% of European metalized paper production, with Lecta having the third largest
capacity.

_1-side coated._ 1-side coated is a wood free or recycled content paper with a pigmented coating on
one side, designed primarily for conventional printing or digital printing where the paper typically takes
no role in image formation.

The largest end-use application for 1-side coated in Europe is flexible packaging (in the form of
bags, pouches, sachets and specialty envelopes) accounting for approximately 34% of demand in 2014,
according to AWA. Flexible packaging demand is expected to continue to grow, driven by changing life
styles with a focus on speed and convenience which means more ready-made and pre-prepared food.

Relative to other specialty paper products, the production of 1-side coated in Europe is a more
fragmented market. We estimate that the top five European producers of 1-side coated account for
approximately 51% of European 1-side coated production capacity, with Lecta having the fourth largest
capacity.

_Thermal._ Thermal paper is a copy paper which uses heat to produce its image. Thermal
technology is cost-efficient, very versatile and used in a wide range of end-use segments (e.g., logistics,
medical, tickets, point-of-sale machines, etc.).

The evolution of thermal paper demand has historically been positive, driven both by (i) economic
growth, which affects the level of use and activity in existing printing applications, and (ii) identification
of new applications for the unique benefits of thermal technology. According to the European Thermal
Paper Association statistics, the deliveries of thermal paper grew in Europe at a CAGR of
approximately 3% from 2010 through 2015.

We estimate that, in 2015, the top five European producers of thermal paper accounted for
approximately 89% of European thermal paper production capacity, with Lecta having the fifth largest
capacity.

_Carbonless._ Carbonless paper is an alternative to carbon paper and is typically used to make
multiple copies of an original document without the use of any electronic devices. For example,
carbonless paper is used for car rental contracts.

Demand for carbonless paper continues to be challenged by the ongoing shift from paper to digital
forms. Laves Chemie estimate that European demand for carbonless paper declined by a CAGR of
approximately 9% between 2012 and 2014, while global demand fell by a CAGR of approximately 2%
over the same period.

We estimate that, in 2015, the top five European producers of carbonless paper accounted for
approximately 93% of European carbonless paper production capacity, with Lecta having the second
largest capacity.

_Cast-coated._ Cast-coated paper is high gloss paper typically used for prestige wet-glue labels,
self-adhesive labels and wet-strength self-adhesive labels or prestige packaging.

We estimate that, in 2015, the top five European producers of cast-coated paper accounted for
over 95% of European cast-coated paper production capacity, with Lecta having the fourth largest
capacity.

_UWF._ UWF paper is a wood free fine paper manufactured with chemical pulp, with good
strength, high brightness and is not coated. It provides a non-glare surface suitable for reading and
writing, and therefore used for digital printing such as with high speed ink jet. The largest end-use
applications are printing books, teaching materials, magazines, notebooks and color pictures. According
to EMGE, due to the digital trend and the fact that the UWF paper market is relatively mature,
demand is expected to decrease progressively. The European industry is atomized and experienced
overcapacity. In recent years, there has been a considerable reduction in production capacity and
therefore we believe the market is better balanced. According to Euro-Graph, European deliveries have
been relatively stable in recent years: in 2015, European deliveries amounted to A6.2 million metric
tons, compared to 6.3 million metric tons in 2014 and 6.1 million metric tons in 2014.

**CWF**

CWF is made from chemical pulp and is coated on both sides with minerals and chemicals to
increase the brightness and smoothness of the paper, allowing for higher-quality printing. It can be
produced either on reels or in sheets with the majority of the demand in Western Europe being for
higher-value-added sheeted paper. The finer printing qualities of CWF are a function of its weight and
surface properties. Wood fiber comprises about 60% of each sheet of CWF and provides its structure
and strength. A coating of minerals, primarily calcium carbonate, or marble held together with binders,
is layered on top. This mineral coating gives the sheet a very smooth surface, which allows for very high
printing resolution and the reproduction of small nuances of color and texture.

CWF is generally used for commercial printing, magazines, brochures, annual reports, advertising
materials, direct mail, inserts, flyers, supplements and art books because of its strength, printability and
brightness. Because CWF is used where high reprographic quality is required, it typically serves
higher-end uses and therefore commands a higher price compared to other types of non-specialty
paper. In addition, since the manufacture of CWF requires a complex and demanding production
process, its pricing has been less volatile relative to lower-quality paper grades.

75


-----

CWF is the highest value-added, mass-produced product in the paper industry. In 2015,
approximately 7.2 million metric tons of CWF was manufactured in Western Europe, and
approximately 23.9 million metric tons were produced worldwide. Traditionally European producers
have exported significant volumes of CWF, primarily to North America. In 2015, CWF exports from
Western Europe amounted to approximately 1.4 million metric tons.

In 2015, Western European CWF demand declined by 3% to 4.8 million metric tons according to
EMGE, while Western European CWF deliveries (demand plus net exports) fell by 2% to 6.6 million
metric tons. Germany, the UK, France, Italy and Spain are the main markets, accounting for 70% of
demand in Europe. We estimate that the global demand for CWF was approximately 23.9 million
metric tons in 2015.

The majority of demand for CWF in Europe is for more value added products, specifically paper
that has been converted to sheets. As a result, most paper produced by paper mills needs to be
converted to sheets, and in general this conversion takes place following specific customer orders.
EMGE estimate that demand for sheets in 2015 represents 70% of Western European CWF demand.
In 2015, sheets represented approximately 75% of our CWF production.

In common with other grades of graphic papers, European CWF producers have reduced
production capacity via plant shutdowns or conversions over the past decade. In 2014 and 2015, further
plant closures and restructurings were announced by European paper producers. Scheufelen, one of our
competitors, announced the closure of one of its two production lines at its Oberlenningen mill in
Germany in December 2014, reducing CWF production capacity by 160,000 metric tons per year. Sappi,
another one of our competitors, announced the closure of its Nijmegen mill in the Netherlands in
January 2015, reducing CWF production capacity by 240,000 metric tons per year. Arjowiggins, another
of our competitors, announced the closure of its Wizernes mill in France in June 2015, reducing CWF
production capacity by 140,000 metric tons per year. These closures, totaling approximately 540,000
metric tons per year of capacity in aggregate, represent approximately 7% of the total Western
European CWF production capacity in 2014. In addition, there have been a number of announcements
of progressive capacity reductions, such as those in Metsa Husum (Sweden).

Capacity reductions have improved the supply/demand balance within the European CWF market,
with operating rates in European CWF mills of 94% in 2015 according to EMGE. The market is
expected to remain tightly balanced in the short term as a consequence of the recent closures outlined
above, with operating rates expected to remain above 90% according to EMGE.

We estimate that five producers of CWF (Sappi (24%), UPM (18%), Lecta (17%), Stora Enso
(16%) and Burgo (12%)) currently account for approximately 87% of the European CWF production
capacity. We believe that paper producers will continue to pursue a strategy of capacity rationalization,
closing down less-efficient, high-cost mills, if required, or converting capacity towards specialty
production to better reflect market demand dynamics.

Prior to 2011, rapid economic growth and government incentives spurred investment in the pulp
and paper industry in China, driving a considerable increase in Chinese paper and board as well as
CWF production capacity. This allowed China to change from a net importer to a net exporter of

76


-----

CWF, exporting mainly to Asian markets and to the United States, but also to some extent Europe. In
2011, both the United States and the European Union imposed import duties and tariffs on certain
coated paper products. As a result of these duties and tariffs, imports of CWF into North America and
Europe from Asia, particularly China, declined. In the case of Europe, anti-subsidy duties as high as
12% and anti-dumping duties of up to 35.1% were imposed on Chinese CWF imports such duties were
to expire in May 2016. On February 12, 2016, however, five EU CWF producers, including Lecta, filed
a request with the European Commission for review of these duties. On May 13, 2016, the European
Commission issued a notice of initiation of an expiry review. The anti-subsidy duties and the
anti-dumping duties will continue to apply pending the outcome of the review, which is expected to be
completed within 15 months of the publication of the notice. The anti-dumping duties for imports into
North America were due to expire in October 2015 but have remained in place while under review by
the U.S. International Trade Commission. A determination by the U.S. International Trade Commission
that injury is unlikely to occur to U.S. producers and workers as a result of coated paper imports into
the United States from China and Indonesia could lead to the existing duties being revoked by the U.S.
Department of Commerce with retroactive effect to October 2015. In January 2016, the U.S.
International Trade Commission voted to conduct a full review in light of the interest shown by local
U.S. industry. A determination is not expected until late 2016.

**Pulp**

Wood pulp is the principal raw material required to manufacture paper. Pulp is converted from
wood by means of mechanical or chemical processes. Chemical pulp, used to manufacture CWF, is
produced by cooking wood chips in solutions of caustic chemicals to separate the cellulose fibers used
for pulping. There are two main types of chemical pulp: long-fiber chemical pulp, made of spruce or
pine wood and used to manufacture paper requiring superior strength, such as magazine paper, and
short fiber chemical pulp, made of birch, beech or eucalyptus wood and used to manufacture fine
papers and boards. The price of pulp is highly volatile and sensitive to changes in industry capacity,
producer inventories, the demand for paper, cyclical changes in the world economy and fluctuations in
the U.S. dollar, the reference currency for trading. Fluctuations in pulp prices may, in turn, impact
prices of final paper products. The major chemical pulp producing regions of the world are North
America, Latin America and the Nordic countries.

We currently produce approximately 30% of our pulp needs internally, with the balance purchased
from the market. We believe we have access to adequate market sources for the remainder of our pulp
and base paper needs. Through our partial pulp integration, we seek to maximize earnings stability by
increasing production cost stability but at the same time allowing paper prices to more closely track
pulp prices.

**Paper and Pulp Prices**

Paper prices continue to be influenced by developments in raw material pricing, including the cost
of pulp. Paper manufacturers seek to maintain a spread between the price of pulp and the price of
CWF.

In the past few years, CWF prices in Western Europe have remained relatively stable, while pulp
prices, as measured by the price of bleached kraft pulp, were also largely stable during 2012 to 2014,
contributing to a steady spread over this period. In 2015, pulp prices increased, causing a tightening of
the spread between the two.

Late 2015 and early 2016 were characterized by falling oil prices which resulted in a decrease in
costs for oil-based raw materials, as well as energy. These lower energy prices, combined with ongoing
pulp capacity increases, particularly in Latin America, are expected to exert downward pressure on pulp
prices in the near to mid-term.

China is expected to face several years of transitional challenges and the outlook for 2016 and
2017 is a gentle decline in demand for paper in general. China’s imports of raw materials are also on a
downward trend, contributing to the fall in oil and commodity prices as well.

**Distribution**

CWF products are generally sold to distributors and directly to printers and major publishers.
Because smaller paper users cannot efficiently be covered by the dedicated sales personnel of a paper

77


-----

company, paper distributors sell to small printers, offices, paper and office products supply stores and
other small businesses that place orders that are too small and may contain too many different product
specifications for a paper producer to serve directly. Paper distributors purchase paper in larger
quantities from paper producers and then generally warehouse the paper and sell it in smaller lots to
these buyers. Paper distributors generally also conduct marketing and promotion activities and assume
credit risks associated with sales. As CWF is extensively used by small businesses, commercial printers
and offices, paper distributors are a particularly important sales channel for CWF.

In 2015, we made 61% of our sales (by value) direct to end users.

**Competition**

Competition in the paper industry is relatively intense. Paper products are largely commodities and
are subject to price competition. Due to the weight of paper, it is relatively expensive to transport.
Therefore, paper producers, like Lecta, who sell their products in markets geographically close to their
mills benefit from cost savings and have a competitive advantage over producers who must transport
their paper long distances or through maritime or river transport. In addition, although most large
industrial paper machines produce paper onto reels, most demand for CWF in Europe is for sheeted
paper. As a result, most paper produced by paper mills needs to be converted to sheets, and in general
this conversion takes place following specific customer orders. To reduce the delivery time of customer
orders, paper manufacturers must operate converting facilities close to their principal markets. Many of
our Nordic competitors incur higher transportation costs and thus are at a competitive disadvantage
from having to ship reeled paper to remote converting facilities located near to customers and then
ship the sheeted paper on to customers. Moreover, manufacturers who maintain converting facilities at
or near their mills experience cost savings due to their ability to reuse the paper waste created from
the cutting process. Brand value is also an important factor in the paper industry, which is
characterized by significant loyalty among printers and end-users. Several other factors also influence a
paper producer’s competitive position, including the cost of raw materials, the efficiency of mills,
product quality and customer service. Our primary competitors are other large paper producers in
Europe, including Burgo Group, Sappi, Stora Enso and UPM-Kymmene.

commercial printing, along with other high value-added paper products. We have an annual production
capacity of 258,000 metric tons of labels and flexible packaging and 231,000 metric tons of UWF and
base paper. We are also the largest CWF manufacturer in Southern Europe, with an annual production
capacity of 1,135,000 metric tons in 2015. We own and operate a 234,000 metric ton pulp mill in Spain,
which provides approximately 30% of our overall pulp requirements. We have ten paper machines in
seven mills located at various sites in Italy, France and Spain. In the twelve months ended March 31,
2016, our mills produced an aggregate of 298,000 metric tons of specialty papers and UWF and
1,142,000 metric tons of CWF.

In addition, we operate a substantial paper distribution business that we have built organically and
through the acquisitions of Malmenayde in France in 2008 and Polyedra in Italy in 2012. In the twelve
months ended March 31, 2016, we distributed 535,000 metric tons of paper, of which 134,000 metric
tons were produced by third parties. We plan to expand our distribution business with selected and
opportunistic bolt-on acquisitions to expand our presence in other countries.

For CWF, we rank first in terms of market share in France and Spain, and second in Italy, the
principal markets for our products, which accounted for 17%, 13% and 16%, respectively, of our paper
deliveries by volume in 2015. We also market our CWF elsewhere in Europe, including
Germany (13%), the United Kingdom (8%) and other Western European countries (9%), Eastern
Europe (4%), and, to a lesser extent, outside of Europe. Our mills are located in close proximity to the
key commercial markets in Western Europe. These markets account for approximately 70% of demand
for CWF in Europe and approximately 75% of our total sales in 2015.

We were formed by CVC Capital Partners (‘‘CVC’’) in 1997 through the acquisition of Cartiere
del Garda of Italy in October of that year, and we subsequently acquired Condat of France in
November 1998 and Torraspapel of Spain in December 1999, all three of which are long-established
paper manufacturing companies.

We have a high-quality asset base, which achieves superior operating performance. Between 1999
and 2015, we invested approximately A1.0 billion in rebuilding our papermaking, coating and converting
machines, increasing our co-generation capabilities, reducing costs, improving productivity, enhancing
our information technology, implementing environmental and safety improvements and maintenance.
We have reduced both our variable and fixed costs through machine modernization and various cost
reduction initiatives, including the coordination of sales and marketing, and raw material purchases,
and extensive internal and external benchmarking of our production processes. Additionally, we have

79

invested in efficient energy production activities and reduction in greenhouse-gas emissions, and
currently benefit from six co-generation plants with total installed capacity of 271 MW.

**Our Strengths**

We believe we have a number of competitive advantages, including:

**_Focus on Specialties and Other Higher Margin Products with Growing Demand._** We are successfully
shifting our product mix, thanks to the significant investments we have made towards increasing
capacity in higher margin products, such as value added specialty papers as well as sheeted CWF and
CWF in premium grades and heavier weights, and are focusing our marketing and distribution efforts
on customers who require these products.

In specialty papers, the focus of our investments has been on shifting our product mix toward
self-adhesive (e.g., labels and flexible packaging), metalized (e.g., labels for beer and spirit bottles),
1-side coated (e.g., premium shopping bags) and thermal (e.g., point-of-sale receipts) papers, all of
which have been experiencing, and which we expect will continue to experience, growing demand due
to the diversified range of day-to-day commercial applications of these papers. We have been successful
in growing our sales in these key focus products at above market rates in 2015. We are particularly
focused on wet-strength labels, top-coated thermal labels, betting applications and travel and admissions
tickets. In addition, we have significant experience in homologation of new self-adhesive, metalized and
1-side coated products. Our know-how of coating technologies and base papers production position us
well to develop new products for labelling and flexible packaging and provide a strong platform for
expanding our product offerings into new industries. Our close proximity to European commercial
printing markets, labels and flexible packaging customers and dedication to customer service enable us
to shift our product mix in response to growth trends.

From 2013 through 2015, we increased our deliveries of self-adhesive, metalized, 1-side coated and
thermal papers by 27%.

We believe that our CWF product mix is more heavily weighted towards higher margin sheets as
compared to our competitors. The charts below show our focus on sheeted paper versus reels and the
breakdown of our specialty paper production.

The majority of our products are sold under the Lecta trademark and their own local product
brand names (Creator, Garda Cartiere and Condat), which we believe have strong recognition among
our target customers in Spain, France, Italy and Portugal. We engage in a variety of targeted
promotional activities and advertising to enhance the recognition of our brands, as we believe that this
helps to differentiate our products.

**_Customer Connectivity via Our Owned Distribution Platform._** In addition to our production activities,
we operate a paper distribution business serving over 20,000 customers, distributing both our own CWF
and specialty papers and those produced by third parties. Our integrated distribution business,
combined with our Internet-based ordering platform, has allowed us to simplify ordering, tracking and
invoicing, and is part of our strategy to continually reduce the logistics costs in our value chain. In
addition, we operate an information system designed for collaborative production planning,
procurement and inventory management processes throughout the supply chain.

Our distribution group is a leader in Southern Europe, with the leading distribution market
position in Spain and the second highest positions in France, Italy and Portugal. Overall, we believe we
are the sixth largest European paper distribution group with sales volume of 535,000 metric tons for
the twelve months ended March 31, 2016, including 134,000 metric tons of third party products. We
currently sell our products through our distribution business in France, Italy Spain and Portugal. Our
distribution business enhances our ability to provide a high level of customer service by improving our
understanding of our customers’ product, final application and service needs, which allows us to more
effectively develop and market new products to meet such requirements. In addition, our distribution
business decreases concentration risk, with our top 10 customers in 2015 representing approximately
20% of our revenue. Our distribution business also enables us to reduce delivery time and increase our
flexibility in adapting to customer needs. Our distribution market position also provides for sales
stability and consistent order inflow to our mills, allowing for production system optimization,
streamlined working capital management and optimization of logistic costs.

**_Optimal Location of Mills, Proximity to Customers and Flexibility and Variety in Production._** Our
CWF and specialty paper mills are located in close proximity to our key commercial markets in Europe
(France, Italy, Spain, Germany, the UK and Portugal) as well as our key customers. These CWF
markets accounted for approximately 71% of demand in Europe and accounted for approximately 68%
of our total deliveries in volume in 2015. We delivered approximately 67% of our specialty papers in
Europe in 2015. The strategic location of our mills allows us to keep logistics costs down, which
generally account for a substantial portion of delivered costs in our industry. Our main CWF
competitors in Europe with mills in Nordic countries are located much further away from our
customers and therefore incur higher logistics costs. Proximity to customers also allows us to better
manage inventories and to provide improved customer service by being able to more quickly respond to
our customers’ needs. Although most large paper machines produce reels of paper, most demand for
CWF and specialty papers in Europe is for sheeted paper, which generates higher margins. As a result,
most paper produced by paper mills needs to be converted to sheets, and in general this conversion
takes place following specific customer orders. To reduce the delivery time of customers’ orders, paper
manufacturers must operate converting facilities close to their principal markets. As our converting
facilities are situated at or near our paper mills, our ability to efficiently satisfy orders while minimizing
waste provides us with a cost advantage over most of our competitors.

We manufacture our CWF on seven medium-width machines, which we believe are best suited for
the production of most CWF products. Since the CWF market generally demands a greater variety of
basis weights and surface finishes than other types of graphic paper, these machines allow us to
produce our paper in a broad range of basis weights and coated surface finishes while maintaining
optimal production runs with minimal waste and downtime between runs.

**_Owned Energy Assets Providing Supply Security._** We own and operate five co-generation plants and
benefit from a sixth plant at Condat, with a total installed capacity of 271MW. We generate more
electricity than we consume through our co-generation plants that produce electrical and thermal
energy fueled by natural gas or biomass, thereby helping to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions and
raising energy efficiency.

**_Supply Chain Integration._** Our integration in each stage of production provides us with full
visibility of the entirety of our supply chain. Our ability to source approximately 30% of our own pulp
and source approximately 76% of our base paper from our mills reduces earnings volatility and
increases our manufacturing flexibility with respect to CWF and specialty papers. We are able to
leverage our increasing base paper integration to generate higher profit margins.

As a result of such supply chain integration, we optimize inventory costs and, with the visibility
provided by our sales and marketing knowledge, are able to adapt the production process to the
changing market environment with full control of the production chain and thereby add value to each
stage. We are integrated upstream in energy and pulp production (partially), as well as downstream via
our distribution business. We believe this provides us with a marked competitive advantage over other
industry participants.

**_Well-Invested Asset Base and Efficient, Low-Cost Production._** All of our mills and paper machines
were modernized through a series of investment projects between 1999 and 2015, totaling
approximately A1.0 billion focused on increasing added value, continuing cost reduction and increasing
environmental performance and co-generation capabilities. We have reorganized production
significantly through targeted headcount reductions, mill restructuring and closures, CWF production
homogenization, the interchangeability of production among different mills and investment in
co-generation. We intend to continue increasing our capacity production in specialty papers. We
reduced overall labor costs by 7% between 2013 and 2015, primarily as a result of an overall reduction
in headcount by approximately 14%. Our CWF machines are, we believe, among the most efficient in
Europe and such efficiency, combined with low logistics and converting costs, provides us with a cost
advantage in our key markets.

Our concerted effort to produce at low-cost is underpinned by the many cost-reduction initiatives
we have successfully implemented since 2013. We harmonized the bonus scheme across the Group. At
our Italian mill, we converted part of the fixed labor costs into a variable cost linked to the
performance of the company. Our Italian and French distribution businesses have been restructured to
outsource the transportation activity and centralize management and administrative activities. Similarly,
in Spain, we have centralized the Group’s financial activities and outsourced non-core activities at one

of our mills. We have also embarked on a continuing plan to renegotiate labor agreements with unions
to align incentives towards improved company performance.

**_Skilled Personnel and Incentivized Management._** Our management team has significant operating
experience and is highly regarded by participants in the paper industry. The management team has
successfully reorganized our operations, which are now fully integrated, with centrally managed
purchasing, sales, marketing, risk, management, finance and administration functions. Each of our
senior managers has been granted an incentive package with a strong focus on increasing EBITDA and
cash generation.

**Our Strategy**

Our objectives are to continue to grow in specialty papers, increase our offering of higher margin
products, build on our position as the leading CWF producer in Southern Europe, improve EBITDA
and cash flow and increase the company value. The key elements of our strategy are as follows:

**_Continue to Increase Production of Specialties and Other Higher Margin Products with Growing_**
**_Demand._** We intend to continue focusing on increasing the production of specialty paper products and
distribution of higher grade, heavier weight and sheeted CWF products, which generate higher margins.
In addition, we intend to continue focusing on increasing the share of certain specialty paper products
in our product mix, notably self-adhesive, metalized, 1-side coated and thermal papers, which have all
experienced, and we expect will continue to experience, growing demand, and which we have been
successful in growing our sales at above market rates in 2015. Our know-how of coating technologies
and base papers production positions us well to develop new products for labelling and flexible
packaging, in order to best exploit new market opportunities.

**_Maintain Low-Cost Production and Achieve Further Operating Efficiencies._** We believe we are a
low-cost producer of CWF largely due to our past capital investment projects and capacity
rationalization, which have improved the efficiency of our machines. From 2013 through 2015, we and
the other European CWF producers experienced an improvement in operating ratio (ratio of CWF
deliveries over CWF production capacity) from 86% in 2013 to 94% in 2015. We seek to further
improve the efficiency of all of our mills through the vigorous application of best practices, the use of
up-to-date technological processes and risk management techniques, and thereby increase our cost
competitiveness and margins. We continue to take steps to increase productivity as measured by metric
tons produced per employee. We also measure the performance of each of our mills against internal
and external benchmarks relating to operational key indicators and raw material consumption. We
currently benefit from six co-generation plants with a total installed capacity of 271MW, contributing to
reducing our energy costs through the sale of excess electricity.

**_Focus on Our Customers._** We continue to focus on our core target markets of France, Italy, Spain,
Germany, the UK and Portugal where we enjoy brand awareness and cost advantage over our
competitors. We may seek to further enhance our customer focus by expanding our distribution
capabilities, while maintaining and further developing our relationships with third-party distributors. We
may also seek to expand our direct sales to end-users, and we will continue to carefully evaluate
acquisitions opportunities in the distribution area that may arise from time to time.

**_Disciplined Investment in Key Focus Areas._** We intend to continue to evaluate opportunities to
optimize our asset base, with a focus on existing areas with strong potential growth, including value
added specialties as well as sheeted CWF and CWF in higher grades and heavier weights. As we have
done in the past, we will continue to seek out opportunities to make disciplined investment in organic
growth areas, such as machinery and marketing campaigns, which we expect to result in improved
margins and returns. In addition, we are initiating an upgrade of our IT systems, which we expect to
complete over the next three years.

**_Continue to Respect the Environment._** We intend to continue focusing on the sustainability of our
production and comply with the highest environmental standards. We have improved and will seek to
continue improving our environmental performance by reducing our CO2 emissions, water use, energy
consumption and sludge sent to disposal sites. We believe that our products and practices comply with
the highest social and environmental standards in the market and all our mills have met the strictest
audit standards, and carry ISO 14001 and EMAS Environmental Management certifications and
ISO 50001 energy management certification guaranteeing transparent and responsible environmental

performance. All of our wood and pulp purchases are sourced from sustainably-managed forests and
certified under the PEFC (Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification) and FSC (Forest
Stewardship Council) chain of custody standards. We also intend to continue publishing environmental
reports and providing information on the sources of raw materials used in our products.

**History and Organization of the Lecta Group**

We are controlled by funds advised by CVC, one of the largest private equity firms in Europe. We
were formed in 1997 in Luxembourg to participate in the consolidation of the CWF manufacturing
industry. We participated in this consolidation by acquiring Garda in October 1997, Condat in
November 1998 and Torraspapel in December 1999, creating a European CWF manufacturing group
and adding value by realizing synergies and growing the three businesses as a group.

In July 2012, we acquired Polyedra, the second largest paper distributor in Italy.

In September 2012, Condat Holding SAS acquired the remaining interest in Nord Papier SA to
fully own Nord Papier SA. Nord Papier SA merged with Torraspapel Malmenayde SAS in June 2015.

In December 2013, Torraspapel S.A. and Sarriopapel y Celulosa SA sold 100% of their
participation in the Argentinean paper distributor Torraspapel Argentina SA.

Within Lecta we continually share best practices to increase production efficiency, optimize
technological processes, manage risks and reduce costs. Through extensive internal benchmarking
relating to operational key indicators and raw material consumption, Garda, Condat and Torraspapel
have continued reducing their variable and fixed costs.

In February 2016, we started implementing a new organizational structure with the creation of
three business units: Specialty Papers, Distribution and Fine Paper. This new organizational approach is
part of a broader project for change across the Group that includes streamlining processes, upgrading
IT systems, optimizing functions and overall cultural transformation.

Our management team has significant operating experience and is highly regarded by participants
in the paper industry. The management team has successfully reorganized our operations, which are
now fully integrated, with centrally managed purchasing, sales, marketing, risk management, financing
and administration functions. In addition, each of our senior managers has been granted an incentive
package with a strong focus on increasing EBITDA and cash generation.

**Products and Services**

We primarily produce CWF and specialty papers (on which we have a growing focus).

Specialty papers are made from both chemical and mechanical pulp and like CWF are typically
used where high reprographic quality is required, such as for graphic design, labels, converting, forms
and digital imaging. Torraspapel produces our specialty papers, which include self-adhesive, metalized,
1-side coated, thermal, carbonless cast-coated and uncoated papers. We are successfully shifting our
product mix toward 1-side coated, thermal, metalized and self-adhesive papers, which have healthy and
stable markets.

CWF is made from chemical pulp and is coated on both sides with minerals and chemicals to
increase the brightness and smoothness of the paper, allowing for higher-quality printing. CWF is
generally used for commercial printing, magazines, brochures, annual reports, advertising materials and
art books because of its strength, printability and brightness. Because CWF is used where high
reprographic quality is required and consequently serves higher-end uses, it commands a higher price
compared to other types of paper. We produce our CWF with a variety of print characteristics, coatings
and other features in order to meet the specific needs of customers. We are shifting our product mix
towards premium-grade, heavier weight and sheeted CWF products, which generate higher margins.

In addition, we engage in other activities consisting of the resale of purchased products, which
amounted to 133,646 metric tons in the twelve months ended March 31, 2016 and the sale of energy,
which amounted to 1,100,887 MWh in the twelve months ended March 31, 2016.

84


-----

**Customers**

We have a diversified customer base. Our customers for CWF consist primarily of distributors,
printers and publishers. Our customers for specialty products consist primarily of distributors, high-end
packagers and industrial end-users.

A significant portion of specialty papers and CWF sales in Europe are conducted through
distributors. Accordingly, we believe that maintaining and further developing our relationships with
distributors is an important strategic objective. We may also seek opportunities to further develop our
own distribution, beyond our current distribution business.

We sell our products to a large number of customers, over 20,000 in 2015, and we benefit from
numerous long-standing relationships with many of our most significant customers. In the year ended
December 31, 2015, our top 10 customers represented approximately 20% of our revenue.

**Marketing and Distribution**

We sell our paper products through the sales networks of our operating subsidiaries primarily in
Italy, France, Spain and Portugal and also have an established customer base in the United Kingdom,
Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, the United States, Canada and Mexico.

We tailor our sales and marketing activities to serve different categories of customers. We sell our
products primarily through our distribution business, directly to printers and publishers and to
distributors.

We believe the locations of our paper mills and distribution centers give us certain logistical
advantages over our competitors from the Nordic countries due to the close proximity of our mills to
our major markets. Our paper distribution business maintains warehouses in Spain, Portugal, France
and Italy to service our customers in these countries. Most of our product deliveries are to customers
within Europe and we use third parties to transport our products in Europe by truck or rail. We use
third parties to ship our products by sea to customers outside of Europe.

**Facilities and Operations**

**_Production and Distribution_**

We have seven factories and ten paper machines that comprise our specialty paper and CWF
manufacturing operations. We manufacture or convert specialty papers at four factories in Spain and
we manufacture CWF at five factories located in Italy, France and Spain on seven CWF machines and
a variety of converting, coating and finishing machines. We believe that our manufacturing facilities are
in excellent operating condition and are suited for the purposes for which they are being used.

All of our factories are located in close proximity to the local printing markets in Southern
Europe, which provides us with a competitive advantage over our Nordic competitors in our home
markets by keeping our logistics costs low. Being located near our local printing markets also allows us
to perform sheet converting at our factories, which results in cost savings and improved inventory
management and customer service. In contrast to our competitors who operate far from their principal
markets and thus generally must perform sheet converting far from their operating facilities, our on-site
converting allows us to reuse the paper waste produced in the converting process.

Paper machines do not have any set lifespan but rather can be continually upgraded and
modernized to change any aspect of their function, other than width of the output. As a result, we have
purchased only one second hand machine since 1997, installed in Zaragoza in 2014 with a production
capacity of 141,000 metric tons of base paper and UWF. Furthermore, we have invested significant
amounts to upgrade our existing machines to improve quality and reduce costs. The resulting increase
in capacity has allowed us to shut down our less profitable operations. The machines used at each of
our facilities and the components used to upgrade our machines are manufactured by leading paper
machine manufacturers.

We believe that a system of medium-width machines that are modernized, specialized and of high
productivity are better suited than larger, wider machines for the production of the majority of CWF
products. All of our CWF machines are of medium-width, between three and five meters wide. Our
CWF machines are specialized to produce particular basis weights and coated surface finishes. Annual
production per machine is between 115,000 and 230,000 metric tons, depending on the type of machine.

85


-----

We have added coating steps and/or coating capacity to all of our production lines, allowing for more
and thicker coating layers on our paper. In addition to improving the quality of our paper, increasing
the coating layers allows for reduced pulp content, and because the additional coating layers cost less
than the pulp that would be required without the additional coating layers, increasing the coating layers
also reduces costs.

Our papermaking machines, like those of most other large European paper manufacturers,
produce reels of paper. As most demand for specialty papers and CWF in Europe is for sheeted paper,
we convert approximately 75% of the paper we produce into sheets.

The following table sets forth the location and use of our manufacturing facilities.

**Italy**

We acquired Garda, a paper-manufacturing business established in 1956, from Bertelsmann in
October 1997. Today, Garda operates the largest single paper production site in Italy and has an annual
CWF production capacity of 360,000 metric tons.

We replaced the co-generation facility we previously operated in Riva del Garda with a plant that
we constructed, together with Alto Garda Servizi Teleriscaldamento S.p.A., the city-owned utility
company. The facility was completed in December 2008. It produces both steam and electricity for the
mill, and sells hot water to the local municipality. In 2015 we substituted the gas turbine with a new,
upgraded model with higher energy efficiency and environmental performance. The plant is wholly
owned by Alto Garda Power, a joint venture between Garda and Alto Garda Servizi
Teleriscaldamento S.p.A., in which Garda has an 80% ownership interest, with Alto Garda Servizi
Teleriscaldamento S.p.A. owning the remaining 20%.

**France**

We acquired Condat in November 1998 from Smurfit Group (now Smurfit Kappa Group). Condat
was established in 1907 and began papermaking operations in 1931. In July 2013, we closed Condat’s
production line number 6 (which had a CWF production capacity of 130,000 metric tons). Today,
Condat has an annual CWF production capacity of 450,000 metric tons.

**Spain**

We acquired Torraspapel in December 1999 from Grupo Torras, a subsidiary of the Kuwait
Investment Office. Torraspapel’s paper manufacturing operations date from the early 1700s and in 1986
the Kuwait Investment Office gained control of Torraspapel.

In January 2014, we closed the Berrobi/Uranga paper mill in Spain (which had a base paper
production capacity of 27,000 metric tons).

In October and December 2014, we closed the Sarri`a de Ter plant (which had a base paper and
UWF production capacity of 65,000 metric tons) and the Cogeneraci´on del Ter SL plant (which had a
production capacity of 25MW) in Spain.

86


-----

In February 2015, as part of our organization efficiency program we decided to outsource the
non-core activities of the Sant Joan mill.

Torraspapel has an annual CWF production capacity of 325,000 metric tons, a specialty paper
production capacity of 258,000 metric tons, an UWF and base paper production capacity of 231,000
metric tons and a pulp production capacity of 234,000 metric tons.

**_Our Pulp Mill._** Pulp is the primary raw material used in the production of our specialty papers
and CWF. At Torraspapel’s paper mill in Zaragoza we operate a pulp mill, which began operations in
1977 and produces eucalyptus chemical pulp on two production lines for use in our CWF making
operations. The pulp mill produces 30% of the chemical pulp we need to make our CWF and specialty
papers across all of our mills. The pulp mill has an annual production capacity of 234,000 metric tons.

**Paper Distribution**

We act as a paper distributor in Spain, Portugal, France and Italy. In the twelve months ended
March 31, 2016, our paper distribution business sold 535,000 metric tons of specialty papers and CWF.
Our distribution operations allow us to maintain a close understanding of our customers’ product and
service needs and to effectively develop and market new products to meet such requirements. It also
allows us to more rapidly adjust production levels and product mix in response to market demand.

Our distribution business sells to a large number of small-to-medium-sized printers, publishers and
communication agencies. The primary functions of the paper distribution business involve buying paper
from mills in large quantities and redistributing the paper in smaller quantities with short delivery times
to printers, publishers and other customers. The business also involves marketing and promotion
activities.

We operate one distributor in each of Spain, France, Italy and Portugal. We also operate an online
platform with over 10,000 registered customers. These operations are geared toward different market
segments and maintain separate sales forces and brands in order to maximize the target market.
Despite operating different distributors, we centralize the warehouse, logistics and overhead functions
of our distribution business in order to minimize costs.

**Raw Materials**

The principal raw materials used to manufacture our products are pulp, base paper, minerals and
chemicals, energy, wood and water. We believe we have access to adequate sources of the raw materials
necessary to ensure there is no interruption to our required supply for the foreseeable future.

The prices of raw materials are subject to commodity price fluctuations. Due to competitive
pressures, the prices of our products are not always correlated with increases and decreases in the cost
of raw materials. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Product prices and raw material
costs in our industry are volatile, and periods of low product prices or high raw material costs
negatively affect our profitability and cash flows.’’

**_Pulp_**

Wood pulp is the principal raw material required to manufacture paper. Pulp is converted from
wood by means of mechanical or chemical processes. Chemical pulp, used to manufacture CWF, is
produced by cooking wood chips in solutions of caustic chemicals to separate the cellulose fibers used
for pulping. There are two main types of chemical pulp: long-fiber chemical pulp, made of spruce or
pine wood and used to manufacture paper requiring superior strength, such as magazine paper; and
short-fiber chemical pulp, made of birch, beech or eucalyptus wood and used to manufacture fine
papers and boards. We primarily use short-fiber chemical pulp.

In Spain, we operate a 234,000 metric ton (production capacity) eucalyptus pulp mill at our paper
mill in Zaragoza, which produces pulp for our mills in Spain. This pulp production represents
approximately 30% of our overall pulp requirements for our CWF and specialties papermaking
operations. The wood used in our pulp mill in Zaragoza comes from plantations in the Iberian
Peninsula.

Pulp purchased from third parties is our most significant cost, amounting to approximately 21% of
our revenue in the twelve months ended March 31, 2016. We purchase our pulp primarily from leading
pulp producers in Latin America, Iberia and the United States. We have annual volume agreements

87


-----

with our pulp suppliers, with the prices we pay for pulp being determined by prevailing market prices
at the time we place orders with our suppliers. We believe our sources of pulp are sufficiently
diversified to ensure we have sufficient pulp volumes necessary for our paper manufacturing operations.
In the past, pulp prices have undergone significant fluctuations. Pulp prices are highly volatile and
sensitive to changes in industry capacity, producer inventories, demand for paper, and cyclical changes
in the world economy and fluctuations in the U.S. dollar, the reference currency for trading. We do not
engage in hedging against fluctuations in the cost of pulp because we do not enter into long-term fixed
price contracts for the sale of paper.

In general, our level of vertical pulp integration is low relative to many of the paper manufacturers
with which we compete. A number of our competitors have full or nearly full vertical pulp integration,
where mills combine wood pulping production facilities with paper production facilities. Full vertical
pulp integration is intended to avoid sharp variations in the market price of pulp. However, while full
vertical pulp integration may help to stabilize costs, it does not necessarily stabilize earnings, as pulp
costs remain stable but finished goods prices will vary depending on what the market will bear. We
have no plans to invest in additional pulp capacity.

**_Minerals and Chemicals_**

In the twelve months ended March 31, 2016, the purchase of minerals and chemicals represented
approximately 14% of our revenue. The essential minerals and chemicals we use for our paper
manufacturing and coating processes include latex, carbonates, starch and clay. We purchase these
minerals and chemicals from leading producers in Western Europe. We use a combination of open
market purchases and short-term fixed price, short-term variable price and framework agreements to
acquire our minerals and chemicals. In recent years there has been a general increase in the prices of
most of the minerals and chemicals we purchase due to general increases in commodity prices. We are
not dependent on any single supplier for any of our mineral or chemical requirements, although latex
used in paper production is a concentrated industry, and there is generally an adequate source of
supply for these requirements.

**_Energy_**

Energy is a significant component of our production process and in the twelve months ended
March 31, 2016, energy costs were equivalent to approximately 11% of our revenue. Our energy policy
is to secure supplies of gas, steam and electricity that are reliable, cost-effective and environmentally
responsible.

All of our mills have energy management systems in place that are presently certified to the 50001
Standard of the International Organization for standardization guaranteeing efficient and responsible
energy performance.

We operate co-generation energy plants at six of our principal mills which provide, and in many
cases exceed, all of our energy needs at the mills where they are located. The co-generation plants
offer an efficient way to meet our energy needs, as the excess heat generated through the production of
electricity is used to make the steam we need to run our production processes. The Garda mill obtains
all of its energy requirements from its own co-generation plant. In 2007, we invested in a co-generation
plant in Sant Joan, Spain. The plant is 51% owned by Torraspapel and 49% owned by the Spanish
Institute for Energy Diversification and Saving (Instituto para la Diversificaci´on y Ahorro de la Energia)
(the ‘‘IDAE’’). The plant commenced operations in September 2011. Torraspapel currently operates
four co-generation plants at Leitza, Motril, Zaragoza and Sant Joan that collectively produce enough
steam to meet those mills’ annual needs. These plants sell all of the electricity they produce, which
more than compensates for the electricity purchased by the Torraspapel mills.

In France, since the end of the mandatory purchase regime in March 2013, Condat’s steam needs
are produced from traditional boilers.

In Italy, we replaced the co-generation facility we previously operated in Riva del Garda with a
plant that we constructed, together with Alto Garda Servizi, the city-owned utility company. The facility
was completed in December 2008. It produces both steam and electricity for the mill, and sells hot
water to the local municipality. In 2015 we substituted the gas turbine with a new, upgraded model with
higher energy efficiency and environmental performance. Garda has 80% ownership of the plant, with
Alto Garda Servizi Teleriscaldamento S.p.A. owning the remaining 20%.

88


-----

In Spain, we closed the Cogeneraci´on del Ter SL plant (which had a power of 25MW) in
December 2014.

We meet our gas requirements mostly through contracts with local gas suppliers. Gas prices in
Southern Europe are regulated and historically we have rarely hedged our gas costs. We may enter into
arrangements in order to hedge the margin between gas purchase prices and electricity sale prices. Our
steam requirements are met primarily through production from the co-generation plants we operate
and also through a combination of long-term, variable price contracts with local suppliers.

Paper mills require electricity and steam, making co-generation plants their ideal energy source.
The physical characteristics of a co-generation plant are such that self-sufficiency in steam comes with
an excess of electricity available for sale to the grid. A co-generation plant consists of a gas turbine that
produces electricity through an alternator connected to it and produces steam by heating water with the
turbine’s exhaust gas.

Electricity is then partly used to operate different equipment in the paper mill, and the balance of
electricity is sold to the grid. Steam is used to run a steam turbine, which in turn provides additional
electricity, and then to dry paper in the final stages of the production process.

When distance and economics permit, low enthalpy steam, otherwise dispersed into the
atmosphere, is used to heat water, which is distributed to neighboring cities where it replaces fossil
fuels normally used for residential heating.

The high yield of co-generation plants compared with the separate production of electricity and
steam, and the savings resulting from the reduction in use of fossil fuels, is the basis for various
incentive plans in various countries.

**_Wood_**

Wood purchases for our pulp mill were equivalent to approximately 4% of our revenue in the
twelve months ended March 31, 2016. We purchase the majority of our wood in Spain and Portugal at
negotiated market prices. We are not dependent on any one supplier for our wood requirements, and
we believe our sources of wood are sufficiently diversified to ensure an adequate supply at all times of
our wood requirements. Wood prices have remained relatively stable in recent years.

**_Water_**

The production of pulp and paper requires significant quantities of water. All of our facilities are
located in close proximity either to sources of surface water, such as lakes and rivers, or to wells, and
we believe we have access to sufficient supplies of water to meet our operating requirements for the
foreseeable future. Our access to water is dependent on governmental authorizations to operate our
mills. We pay taxes for the water we use in our production facilities.

We continue to reduce our use of fresh water per metric ton of paper produced and to increasingly
rely on water we recycle internally. To improve the quality of the water we discharge into the
environment, we have equipped our mills with water treatment plants to remove suspended solids from
our returned water. Our water treatment plants also reduce the amount of oxygen needed to break
down organic compounds in effluents in our returned water.

**Seasonality**

Historically, we have not experienced seasonality in any material way. However, certain of our
specialty products, such as metalized labels, exhibit a degree of seasonality. If we are successful in
increasing the contribution of our specialty products to our consolidated results, we may begin to
experience seasonality on a consolidated basis.

**Intellectual Property and Research and Development**

We seek to protect our intellectual property rights. We own the registered trademarks for our
products and brands. We also hold various patents relating to our products and the processes for their
production. In addition, we have non-registered intellectual property rights, including trade secrets,
proprietary technology, know-how and processes, many of which are related to our manufacturing
operations. Consistent with the industry in which we operate, our manufacturing operations are not
dependent to a significant extent on our protected intellectual property rights. Although our intellectual

89


-----

property portfolio as a whole is material, we do not believe that any individual intellectual property
right or group of such rights is material to our business.

We also carry out various research and development activities, with the objective of proactively and
continuously improving our processes and products. In certain instances, we pursue research and
development activities in conjunction with third parties involving industry-standard non-disclosure
agreements. Specific research and development activities include innovation and improvement of our
bleaching, bulking, chemical recovery, papermaking and coating processes and research regarding the
raw materials used in our manufacturing processes. In the year ended December 31, 2015, we spent
A2.5 million on research and development activities.

**Loss Prevention and Insurance**

We believe that we maintain insurance coverage that reflects the risks, size and requirements of
our operations and that is comparable to the insurance coverage maintained by other companies
operating in the paper manufacturing industry. We currently carry property damage, business
interruption, general liability, product liability, transportation, environmental impairment and
management liability insurance. In particular, we maintain insurance coverage for all of our properties
and facilities and all of our properties and facilities are valued at their replacement value. We carry
business interruption insurance that covers the full value of potential or realized revenue loss resulting
from major damage to our property. In addition, we participate in various governmental worker
accident and occupational health insurance programs. We believe that our employees have been insured
at least to the extent required by the respective local laws and regulations. On a consolidated basis, in
the year ended December 31, 2015, the total amount we paid for insurance premiums in relation to
Group policies was A10.3 million.

We believe that prevention, protection and employee training are key means of defending against
loss from workplace incidents. In 2015, we spent A0.5 million on various loss prevention initiatives. We
also have a project which aims to extend Highly Protected Risk standard certification to all of our main
mills, which may result in lower insurance premiums.

**Employees**

As of March 31, 2016, we had a total of 3,315 employees as computed on a full-time equivalent
basis. We reduced overall labor costs by 7% between 2013 and 2015, primarily as a result of an overall
reduction in headcount by approximately 14%. The majority of our staff is involved in production.

We believe that we have good relations with our employees and their representatives. Substantially
all of our employees are represented by labor unions pursuant to collective bargaining agreements. We
observe local practice and legislation in our labor relations matters and in negotiating collective
bargaining agreements.

Our employees participate in defined contribution post-employment plans and certain employees
also participate in defined benefit post-employment plans. Our employees do not participate in any
equity-based compensation plans or share-based payment plans.

**Environmental, Health and Safety Regulation**

**_Operation of Production Facilities_**

We operate in an industry that is subject to extensive environmental, health and safety regulation,
including those pertaining to the storage, handling, treatment, transportation and disposal of hazardous
materials, the construction and operation of our mills (including the noise impact of our operations),
the protection of natural resources and endangered species, and our emissions and discharges of
pollutants to air and water. Environmental, health and safety standards applicable to us are established
by the laws of the European Union and the Member States in which we operate, standards adopted by
regulatory agencies and our permits and licenses, each of which is subject to periodic and more
stringent modifications and requirements. Violations of these laws, regulations or permits and licenses
may result in substantial fines and penalties and orders to cease the violating operations or to conduct
or pay for corrective works. In some instances, violations may also result in the suspension or
revocation of permits and licenses.

90


-----

All of our mills have environmental management systems in place that are presently certified to
the 14001 standard of the International Organization for Standardization, and they have each obtained
registration of their environmental management systems under the European Union’s Eco-Management
and Audit Scheme, or EMAS. Nevertheless the risk of environmental, health and safety infractions is
inherent in our industry, and from time to time we have experienced non-compliance with such laws
and regulations and may do so again in the future.

We invest substantial capital resources on environmental and safety compliance. In 2015, we spent
A2.9 million on capital expenditures relating to environmental and safety compliance. The most
significant European Union laws that apply or are expected to apply to our mills are the Integrated
Pollution Prevention and Control (the ‘‘IPPC’’) Directive, now replaced by the Industrial Emissions
(Directive 2010/75/EU) (the ‘‘IED’’), the Emissions Trading Scheme and laws related to the
Environmental Liability Directive.

_IPPC and IED_

The IPPC Directive (96/61/EC, 2008/1/EC), issued in 1996, required each Member State to unify
its environmental licensing regime relating to emissions of air, soil and water. The IPPC Directive
contained several key policies, including the requirement that all emission and pollution control
measures be based on the best available techniques. The IPPC Directive was recast, along with six
other directives, in the IED, which in turn, has been implemented in the environmental permitting
legislation in France, Italy and Spain. All of our facilities have been licensed under the IPPC, now IED,
licensing regime.

The IED (Directive 2010/75/EU) regulates air emissions and water discharges and defines permit
requirements and best available techniques (‘‘BAT’’) for pollution control. A BAT reference document
for our industry was published in 2014.

_Emissions Trading_

The Emissions Trading System (Directive 2003/87/EC), which is part of the European Union’s
efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in accordance with the Kyoto Protocol of 1997, became
effective in January 2005. Pursuant to the national laws that implement this Directive, the applicable
regulator in each Member State issues a greenhouse gas permit and a limited number of allowances for
the annual emission of carbon dioxide to installations that are subject to the scheme, which include our
mills and co-generation facilities in France, Italy and Spain. Actual carbon dioxide emissions from
installations are then audited externally each year to determine whether they meet, fall below or exceed
the annual allowances. To the extent an installation’s carbon dioxide emissions exceed its annual
allowances it must make up for the shortfall by purchasing allowances. Alternatively, an installation
whose emissions fall below its annual allowances may sell its excess allowances, or ‘‘credits.’’

We are required to purchase the vast majority of allowances to account for emissions at our mills,
which allowances are sold at auctions. We have continued to improve the efficiency of our production
processes and our use of energy for those processes, including through the increased use of electricity
generated locally by co-generation. In addition, in 2005 we introduced the Lecta Energy Monitoring
System, which is a benchmarking and process improvement effort designed to reduce our energy
consumption. We expect the requirements of the Emissions Trading System to become increasingly
more stringent and therefore expect to incur additional capital expenditures or other measures (such as
purchasing allowances) to comply with existing or anticipated greenhouse gas emissions limits.

_Environmental Liability Directive_

The Directive on Environmental Liability with regard to the Prevention and Remedying of
Environmental Damage (2004/35/EC) (the ‘‘Environmental Liability Directive’’), aims to prevent and
remedy the pollution of water, damage to biodiversity and land contamination that causes serious harm
to human health. Operators of activities that cause environmental damage may be required to restore
the damage caused or to pay for the cleanup and restoration irrespective of their fault in causing the
damage.

In general, the existing legislation in France, Italy and Spain governing land or water
contamination is as or more stringent than the Environmental Liability Directive. These laws may
impose liability on an owner or occupier of property for investigation and remediation of soil or water

91


-----

contamination at or emanating from the property, regardless of when the contamination was caused
and whether the hazardous material disposal activity that caused it was legal at the time.

Some of our properties are located on land with a long history of industrial use by us and other
companies before us, which has resulted in spills and other releases of hazardous materials over time.
Consequently, we have incurred costs for the remediation of land, soil or water contamination in the
past. The limited testing for contamination that has taken place at certain of our facilities may not be
sufficient to ascertain the extent of our ongoing and future obligations with respect to contamination
relating to our facilities. For example, we previously operated three landfills in the vicinity of the
Condat mill and, based on the testing conducted to date, it is not possible to determine the nature and
extent of contamination, if any, that will require remediation at two of them. We also operate three
landfills in Spain. These landfills, along with our presently and previously operated mills and
co-generation facilities in Spain, may be the subject of additional requirements for investigation and
cleanup of contamination as part of our compliance with Royal Decree 9/2005. Consequently, we may
in the future be subject to substantial costs and liabilities for the investigation and remediation of
contamination. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—We may face high costs for
compliance with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, which would reduce profit
margins and earnings.’’

The national European laws regulate the waste disposal framework and place restrictions on
land-filling materials in order to reduce contaminated leachate and methane emissions. Prevention,
reuse and recycling (material or thermal) are the preferred waste management methods.

**_The 2014 Spanish Regulatory Framework_**

The regulatory framework passed in June 2014 through Royal Decree Law 9/2013, Law 24/2013 on
the Electricity Sector, Royal Decree 413/2014, Ministerial Order IET/1045/2014 and Ministerial Order
IET 1344/2015, sets out a remuneration scheme for existing renewable, co-generation and waste
generation facilities to ensure financial stability of the electricity sector. The Regulatory Framework
provides for regulated levels of remuneration that the government has fixed for our electricity
production over three- to six-year periods. In addition to the Regulatory Framework, electricity
producers are required to pay a transmission and distribution system access fee. In 2011, the
government fixed this fee at A0.50 per MWh delivered to the network. Due to these regulations our
ability to make adequate provisions for future operations may be compromised, and we may fail to
meet the requirements in terms of operating costs, minimum number of hours of operation and
meeting the payments for the estimated regulated income. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our
Business—Regulatory changes have affected our business historically and any future changes may have
an adverse effect on our energy generating activities.’’

**_REACH Regulation_**

The EU Chemicals Regulation REACH (1907/2006/EC), intended to harmonize existing European
and national regulations to provide a better protection of human health and our environment, is not
directly applicable to pulp and paper. It does, however, apply to a number of raw materials that we
source. We therefore require our suppliers to provide written evidence that they comply with their
REACH obligations. We also registered some intermediate substances in our pulp production processes
under REACH in November 2010. We do not use substances classified as substances of very high
concern under REACH. We require our suppliers to provide evidence that they do not use substances
of very high concern. We continually review and monitor our compliance with REACH.

**_EU Timber Regulation_**

The EU Timber Regulation (995/2010/EU), which came into force on March 3, 2013, requires that
only timber and timber products (among which pulp and paper) produced in accordance with the
legislation of the timber-producing country enter the European market.

The EU Timber Regulation prohibits trade of illegally harvested timber or products derived from
such timber in the European market. To that end, the EU Timber Regulation requires operators who
place timber products on the EU market for the first time to exercise ‘‘due diligence,’’ to provide
detailed information on the supply chain of timber products and evidence of compliance with
applicable law. Moreover, to facilitate the traceability of timber products, traders in the supply chain
have an obligation to keep records of their suppliers and customers.

92


-----

We buy wood, pulp and paper products mainly within the European Union but also a small
quantity outside the European Union. In order to comply with the EU Timber Regulation, we require
our suppliers located in the European Union to provide evidence that they have conducted due
diligence to comply with the traceability obligation. We require our suppliers located outside the
European Union to provide all necessary information for us and a certification company to conduct
due diligence. We also require our suppliers to confirm that they comply with the EU Timber
Regulation. We keep records of our suppliers and customers for at least five years in accordance with
the EU Timber Regulation.

**_Other Forestry and Wood and Pulp Procurement Measures_**

Our procurement of wood and pulp strives to balance the economic, environmental and social
aspects of sustainability. The European paper industry is required to ensure that wood and pulp
originate from sustainably managed forests that ensure a long-term supply of the best wood quality
products while maintaining and improving wildlife habitat and other components of the forest
ecosystem. The major types of endorsement programs for wood, pulp and paper originating from
sustainably managed forests are forestry certification schemes, certified products and chain of custody
certifications. All of our wood and pulp purchases are certified under the PEFC (Programme for the
Endorsement of Forest Certification) and FSC (Forest Stewardship Council) chain of custody
standards.

We continue to work to gain acceptance and recognition of our wood and pulp procurement
practices through these certification schemes. We do not purchase wood or pulp that we know to
originate from protected areas or areas in the process of designation for protection, unless purchases
are clearly in line with the relevant conservation regulations and goals. We do not purchase wood that
we know to be from old-growth forests.

**_Health and Safety Regulation and Liabilities_**

The pulp and paper industries involve inherently hazardous activities including, among other
things, the operation of heavy machinery. Italy, France and Spain each regulates health and safety in
the workplace. We have obtained OHSAS 18001 certificated occupational health and safety standards
certification in all of our mills.

**Legal Proceedings**

We are party to pending legal proceedings (including tax audits) arising in the ordinary course of
business. While the results of such proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe
any of these matters will be material to the business, financial condition, results of operations or cash
flows of Lecta S.A., taken as a whole.

**_General_**

Lecta S.A. is a public limited liability company (soci´et´e anonyme) governed by the laws of
Luxembourg, its articles of incorporation and by-laws and the Shareholders’ Agreement. See ‘‘Certain
Relationships and Related Party Transactions—Shareholders’ Agreement.’’ All matters not governed by

95


-----

its articles of incorporation and by-laws and the Shareholders’ Agreement are determined in
accordance with Luxembourg law. Lecta S.A.’s articles of incorporation and by-laws and the
Shareholders’ Agreement also determine the decisions that require collective shareholder approval, in
addition to those decisions that Luxembourg law reserves to the general shareholders’ meeting.

**_Control of CVC Investors over Lecta S.A._**

The Board of Directors has general responsibility for the management of Lecta S.A. The Board of
Directors establishes the principles of Lecta S.A.’s strategy, organization and accounting and financial
control, and appoints the executive management team. The Board of Directors meets at least four
times per year and the members are appointed at the annual general meeting of shareholders.

The articles of incorporation of Lecta S.A. provide that the Board of Directors must be composed
of at least three members. The Shareholders’ Agreement provides that the Board of Directors of
Lecta S.A. must consist of 10 directors. CVC European Equity Partners II L.P., Capital Ventures
Nominees Limited and CCIEL LLC (together, the ‘‘CVC Investors’’) have the power to designate, at a
minimum, eight out of the 10 directors. See ‘‘Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions—
Shareholders’ Agreement.’’ The Board of Directors has the power to appoint directors to the boards of
directors of any of the direct and indirect subsidiaries of Lecta S.A. following the favorable vote of the
majority of the shareholders of the relevant subsidiary in respect of such directors.

Certain corporate actions of Lecta S.A. may be exercised exclusively by the Board of Directors,
including actions related to the sale, transfer or purchase of substantial assets, the incurrence of
substantial debt and the exercise of voting rights in the capital of the direct and indirect subsidiaries of
Lecta S.A. Similar corporate actions of the direct and indirect subsidiaries of Lecta S.A. may be
exercised under the supervision of the shareholders of such subsidiaries.

**_Relationship between the CVC Investors and the Management of Lecta S.A._**

The chief executive officer of Lecta S.A. and the chief executive officer of each of its subsidiaries
are appointed by the CVC Investors. Lecta S.A.’s corporate management group is chaired by its chief
executive officer. The members of the corporate management group are appointed by the Board of
Directors. On an annual basis the chief executive officers of Lecta S.A. and its subsidiaries are required
to submit to their respective boards of directors for consideration and approval a draft business plan
and budget for the following year.

**_Ownership Interests in Lecta S.A._**

Lecta S.A. has issued 19 classes of shares, including voting ordinary shares, voting and non-voting
preferred shares. In addition to the voting rights conferred by law to both classes of shares or by the
articles of incorporation to the ordinary shares and some preferred shares, each share gives a right to a
portion of Lecta S.A.’s net assets on winding-up, with preferred shares having priority over ordinary
shares, in proportion to the number and nominal value of the shares outstanding.

Lecta S.A. has also issued certain warrants to its management and its former payment-in-kind
noteholders. In the future, these warrants may be convertible into shares of Lecta S.A., in variable
amounts, as specified by each type of warrant.

Lecta S.A.’s annual shareholders’ meetings and extraordinary shareholders’ meetings are usually
called by the Board of Directors with eight days’ notice. In specific circumstances, annual shareholders’
meetings and extraordinary shareholders’ meetings can be called by the statutory auditors of

**PRINCIPAL SHAREHOLDERS**

The following table sets forth, as of March 31, 2016, information regarding the beneficial
ownership of our share capital. The percentages of partnership interests beneficially owned by each
interest holder are reported on the basis of SEC rules governing the determination of beneficial
ownership, and the information is not necessarily indicative of beneficial ownership for any other
purpose. Under such rules, a person is deemed to be a beneficial owner of a security if that person has
or shares voting power, which includes the power to vote or direct the voting of a security, or
investment power, which includes the power to dispose of or direct the disposition of a security, and
includes securities for which a person holds the right to acquire beneficial ownership within 60 days.
We believe the beneficial owners named below have sole voting or investment power with respect to all
interests shown as beneficially owned by them.

**CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS**

**Shareholders’ Agreement**

Each shareholder in Lecta S.A. has entered into a Shareholders’ Agreement dated December 10,
1999, as amended and restated on each of June 20, 2000, December 13, 2002 and October 22, 2003 and
renewed on December 13, 2009. The Shareholders’ Agreement governs certain rights of, and voting
restrictions among, the parties. The Shareholders’ Agreement contains provisions related to the election
and removal of Lecta S.A.’s directors and the directors of its direct and indirect subsidiaries, the
issuance or transfer of ownership interests in Lecta S.A., including provisions for tag-along rights and
drag-along rights, and certain other corporate governance provisions, including the rights of the CVC
Investors, certain members of management and other shareholders in Lecta S.A. to approve various
corporate actions.

The Shareholders’ Agreement provides that the Board of Directors shall consist of 10 directors.
Pursuant to the Shareholders’ Agreement, a minimum number of eight of the directors will be
designated by the CVC Investors, one director will be designated by Midocean Capital Investors
Offshore L.P. and, for so long as Adavale Global Holdings Limited (‘‘Adavale Global Holdings’’) holds
at least 10% of Lecta S.A.’s entire capital stock, which includes any other securities of Lecta S.A.
convertible into shares of Lecta S.A., one director will be designated by Adavale Global Holdings. If, at
any time, Adavale Global Holdings holds less than 10% of the entire capital stock of Lecta S.A., the
director it would otherwise be entitled to designate will be designated by the CVC Investors.

The Shareholders’ Agreement further provides that certain corporate actions of Lecta S.A. may be
exercised exclusively by its Board of Directors and certain corporate actions of the direct and indirect
subsidiaries of Lecta S.A. may be exercised exclusively by the shareholders of such subsidiaries.

**DESCRIPTION OF OTHER INDEBTEDNESS**

_The following summary of our significant indebtedness does not purport to be complete and is subject_
_to, and qualified in its entirety by, the underlying documents._

**The Existing Credit Facilities**

On May 11, 2012, the Issuer issued Floating Rate Senior Unsecured Notes due 2018 and Senior
Secured Notes due 2019, guaranteed on a senior basis by certain subsidiaries of the Issuer (the
‘‘Existing Notes’’). In addition, a revolving credit facility was entered into by the Issuer and various of
its subsidiaries to, among other things, refinance existing debt of the Group (the ‘‘Existing Credit
Facilities’’). In connection with the Refinancing, the Existing Credit Facilities will be cancelled and all
amounts under the Existing Notes will be redeemed and all security granted pursuant to which the
Existing Senior Secured Notes will be released.

**Existing Co-generation Financings**

We have entered into certain financing arrangements in connection with our co-generation
facilities. The Alto Garda Power S.r.l. co-generation plant is funded through an interest-bearing cash
advance in the form of declared but unpaid dividends owed to its shareholders in an amount of
A4 million as of March 31, 2016 and non-recourse project financing, comprising a base facility of
A56 million and a stand-by facility and working capital facility, each of A5.0 million. As of March 31,
2016, the principal and accrued interest under the dividend cash advance was A4.5 million. Payments on
the base and stand-by facilities are made on a six-month basis, commencing December 31, 2009 and
ending on December 31, 2020. The working capital facility is a revolving credit line to be repaid by
December 31, 2020. As of March 31, 2016, the principal amount drawn and accrued interest under the
Alto Garda Power S.r.l. facilities was A18.7 million.

The IDAE Sant Joan co-generation plant is funded through a non-recourse revolving credit facility
with a cap progressively declining since June 30, 2012, until its maturity date at September 30, 2018. As
of March 31, 2016, the cap of the facility was A11.0 million and principal and accrued interest was
A10.0 million.

**Existing Assignment of Trade Receivables**

In 2000, Garda entered into an assignment of trade receivables (the ‘‘Existing Assignment’’) to
improve cash flow and finance working capital. The Existing Assignment will remain in place after the
Refinancing.

The Existing Assignment provides two financial facilities: (i) an invoice discounting arrangement
and (ii) a cash advance on assigned receivables, in each case based on non-notification clauses. The
invoice discounting arrangement provides for the assignment of invoices to a factor, and the factor pays
to Garda the discounted amount based on the interest rate, par value and due date of the receivable.
Garda is entitled to collect payments directly from its customers pursuant to a cash warrant clause, and
immediately upon collecting payments from its customers, Garda transfers the relevant amounts to the
factor acting as agent. As of March 31, 2016, the invoice discounting arrangement amounted to
A17.0 million.

The second facility, the cash advance on assigned receivables facility, provides Garda with an
interest-bearing cash advance on non-discounted assigned receivables and entitles Garda to collect
payments directly from its customers. As of March 31, 2016, this second facility amounted to

**New Revolving Credit Facility**

As part of the Refinancing, on or around the date of the issuance of the Notes, Lecta S.A. (as
original borrower and guarantor), will enter into the New Revolving Credit Facility between, Credit
Suisse International, Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch (as Arrangers), BBVA and UniCredit S.p.A.,
and Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch (as Facility Agent, original Issuing Bank and Security
Trustee). The New Revolving Credit Facility provides for a A65.0 million committed revolving credit
facility and includes an uncommitted accordion feature that would enable the facility to be increased by
up to A15.0 million. In the event that the A65.0 million committed revolving credit facility is reduced by
reason of a lender defaulting or it becomes unlawful for a lender to provide or continue to provide
funding, the borrower is entitled to request that the aggregate commitments are increased to permit
another lender or lenders to provide a commitment equal to the commitment of the defaulting lender.
Debt incurred under the New Revolving Credit Facility will rank pari passu with the Notes.

**_Interest and maturity_**

The loans under the New Revolving Credit Facility will bear interest at LIBOR or, in relation to
any loan in euro, EURIBOR, plus a margin of 4.00% per annum payable on the last day of each
applicable interest period (as determined in accordance with the terms of the New Revolving Credit
Facility agreement (the ‘‘RCF Agreement’’)); provided that at the end of the first quarter following the
anniversary of the date of completion of the Offerings and at the end of each quarter thereafter the
margin will fluctuate with and be tied to our ratio of Net Debt to EBITDA (as both terms are defined
in the RCF Agreement) at a rate per annum of between 4.00% and 3.25%. The lower margin will be
applicable if our ratio of Net Debt to EBITDA is less than 3.5:1 while the higher margin will be
applicable if our ratio of Net Debt to EBITDA is greater than or equal to 4.5:1.

The termination date of the New Revolving Credit Facility is the sixth anniversary of the date the
RCF Agreement is signed.

**_Covenants and Events of Default_**

The RCF Agreement contains certain restrictive covenants and events of default which, subject to
conforming amendments, reflect the covenants and events of default contained in the Notes. The RCF
Agreement also contains certain customary representations and warranties for facilities of this type. In
addition, the Issuer shall not, and shall procure that none of its subsidiaries shall, repay, prepay,
purchase, defease (or otherwise retire for value) or directly or indirectly acquire any of the Notes or
offer to do so unless (to the extent the aggregate amount applied towards such Notes purchases
exceeds A295.0 million) the commitments under the RCF Agreement are also cancelled pro rata. The
RCF Agreement does not contain any financial maintenance covenants.

**_Security and Guarantees_**

Our obligations under the RCF Agreement will be secured by first-priority security interests over
the same assets as those securing the Notes. Guarantees, subject to certain limitations in relation to
unlawful financial assistance and/or save which would result in directors or officers acting in
contravention of their fiduciary duties or would subject them to civil or criminal or personal liability as
a result of providing such guarantees, will be jointly and severally provided by the same subsidiaries
guaranteeing the Notes.

100


-----

**_Voluntary Prepayments_**

The Issuer has the option to voluntarily prepay or cancel all or part of the New Revolving Credit
Facility in tranches of at least A250,000 (and in multiples of A250,000 if more) with not less than five
business days’ notice for each of cancellation and prepayments. The Issuer has the option to voluntarily
prepay an individual lender or issuing bank in the event that any sum payable to that lender or issuing
bank is required to be increased due to a tax gross-up or indemnification or where increased costs are
payable in certain circumstances.

**_Mandatory Prepayments_**

Mandatory prepayment and cancellation of the New Revolving Credit Facility will, reflecting the
covenants contained in the Notes, occur upon (i) certain change of control events and a sale of
substantially all of our assets or (ii) it being illegal for a lender to provide or continue to provide
funding (such prepayment will be limited to such lender’s share). In the case of any prepayment, the
Issuer would be required to pay break costs.

**Intercreditor Agreement**

In connection with entering into the RCF Agreement and the Indentures, the Issuer and the
Guarantors entered into the Intercreditor Agreement to govern the relationships and relative priorities
between, among others: (i) the lenders under the New Revolving Credit Facility (the ‘‘RCF Lenders’’);
(ii) any persons that accede to the Intercreditor Agreement as counterparties to certain other hedging
agreements (collectively, the ‘‘Hedging Agreements’’ and any persons that accede to the Intercreditor
Agreement as counterparties to the Hedging Agreements are referred to in such capacity as the
‘‘Hedge Counterparties’’); (iii) the Trustee, on its behalf and on behalf of the holders of the Notes (the
‘‘Noteholders’’); and (iv) subsidiaries of the Issuer which are borrowers or guarantors of the New
Revolving Credit Facility (each an ‘‘Obligor’’).

The Issuer and each of its Restricted Subsidiaries that provides any guarantee under the RCF
Agreement or the Indentures is each referred to in this description as an ‘‘Obligor’’ and are referred to
collectively as the ‘‘Obligors’’. In this description ‘‘Group’’ refers to the Issuer and its Restricted
Subsidiaries.

The Intercreditor Agreement sets forth:

  - the relative ranking of certain indebtedness of the Obligors;

  - the relative ranking of certain security granted by the Obligors;

  - when payments can be made in respect of certain indebtedness of the Obligors;

  - when enforcement actions can be taken in respect of that indebtedness;

  - the terms pursuant to which that indebtedness will be subordinated upon the incurrence of
certain insolvency events;

  - turnover provisions; and

  - when security and guarantees will be released to permit a sale of any assets subject to
transaction security (the ‘‘Collateral’’).

The Intercreditor Agreement contains provisions relating to future indebtedness that may be
incurred by the Obligors or another group company that is permitted by the RCF Agreement and the
Indentures to rank pari passu with the New Revolving Credit Facility and the Notes and be secured by
the Collateral, subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (such debt being ‘‘Pari Passu
Liabilities’’ and the creditors of such debt being ‘‘Pari Passu Creditors’’). The Intercreditor Agreement
allows for a refinancing in full or in part of the Notes or the New Revolving Credit Facility or any Pari
_Passu Liabilities._

The following description is a summary of certain provisions, among others, contained in the
Intercreditor Agreement. It does not restate the Intercreditor Agreement in its entirety, and we urge
you to read that document because it, and not the description that follows, defines your rights as
holders of the Notes.

101


-----

**_Ranking and Priority_**

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the liabilities of the Obligors with respect to the New
Revolving Credit Facility (the ‘‘RCF Liabilities’’) and the Hedging Agreements (the ‘‘Hedging
Liabilities’’ and together with the RCF Liabilities, the ‘‘Super Senior Liabilities’’), the liabilities of the
Obligors in respect of the Notes (the ‘‘Senior Secured Notes Liabilities’’), the Pari Passu Liabilities and
the liabilities of the Obligors under certain intercompany loans relating to the on-lending of the
proceeds of the Notes, the repayment of which is needed to enable an Obligor to repay any of the
Senior Secured Notes Liabilities (‘‘Structural Intercompany Liabilities’’), will rank in right and priority
of payment in the following order:

  - first, the Super Senior Liabilities, the Pari Passu Liabilities and the Senior Secured Notes
Liabilities (together with the Super Senior Liabilities and the Pari Passu Liabilities, the
‘‘Secured Liabilities’’) and the Structural Intercompany Liabilities pari passu and without any
preference between them; and

  - second, certain intercompany liabilities of the Issuer and its subsidiaries to the Issuer and its
subsidiaries under intercompany loans which are not Structural Intercompany Liabilities (the
‘‘Non-Structural Intercompany Liabilities’’).

Under the Intercreditor Agreement, all proceeds from enforcement of the Collateral will be
applied as provided under ‘‘—Application of Proceeds.’’

**_Permitted Payments of Subordinated Debt_**

The Intercreditor Agreement permits, among other things, payments to be made by the Obligors in
respect of the RCF Liabilities, the Senior Secured Notes Liabilities, the Pari Passu Liabilities and
Structural Intercompany Liabilities. The Intercreditor Agreement also permits payment of
Non-Structural Intercompany Liabilities from time to time when due to members of the Group owed
Non-Structural Intercompany Liabilities (‘‘Non-Structural Intercompany Liabilities Payments’’) if at the
time of payment no acceleration event has occurred in respect of any Secured Liabilities (an
‘‘Acceleration Event’’). The Intercreditor Agreement permits Non-Structural Intercompany Liabilities
Payments if such an Acceleration Event occurs (i) prior to the date on which all Super Senior
Liabilities are discharged in full and the RCF Lenders have no further obligations under the New
Revolving Facility documents and the Hedge Counterparties have no further obligations under the
Hedging Agreements (the ‘‘Super Senior Discharge Date’’), with the consent of the RCF Agent (as
defined below), (ii) prior to the date on which all the Senior Secured Notes Liabilities are discharged
(the ‘‘Secured Notes Discharge Date’’), with the consent of the Trustee and (iii) prior to the date on
which the Pari Passu Liabilities have been discharged in full and the Pari Passu Creditors have no
further obligation in respect of the _Pari Passu Liabilities (the ‘‘Pari Passu Discharge Date’’), with the_
consent of the creditor representative of the Pari Passu Creditors (the ‘‘Pari Passu Debt
Representative’’).

**_Creditor Representative_**

Under the Intercreditor Agreement, the parties appoint various creditor representatives being:

(a) in relation to the RCF Lenders, the New Revolving Credit Facility agent (the ‘‘RCF Agent’’);

(b) in relation to the Noteholders, the Trustee; and

(c) in relation to the Pari Passu Creditors, the Pari Passu Debt Representative.

Each Hedge Counterparty shall be its own creditor representative.

**_Entitlement to Enforce Collateral_**

The Security Trustee may refrain from enforcing the Collateral or from directing a creditor of the
Structural Intercompany Liabilities to enforce the Collateral unless otherwise instructed by:

(a) prior to the Super Senior Discharge Date, the Pari Passu Discharge Date, the Secured Notes
Discharge Date and the date falling six months after the occurrence of any relevant
Acceleration Event which is continuing (the ‘‘Six Months Date’’), the Secured Notes/Pari Passu
Required Holders (as defined below) and, if the RCF Agent’s instructions are consistent with
those of the Secured Notes/Pari Passu Required Holders, the RCF Agent;

102


-----

(b) after the Super Senior Discharge Date but prior to the Secured Notes Discharge Date and the
_Pari Passu Discharge Date, the Secured Notes/Pari Passu Required Holders; or_

(c) prior to the Super Senior Discharge Date but after the first to occur of (A) the Six Months
Date and (B) the first date on which both the Pari Passu Discharge Date and the Secured
Notes Discharge Date have occurred, the RCF Agent,

and provided that, so long as neither the Super Senior Discharge Date, nor the Pari Passu Debt
Discharge Date nor the Secured Notes Discharge Date has occurred, such instructions are consistent
with certain principles (the ‘‘Security Enforcement Principles’’). See ‘‘—Limitation on Enforcement by
Super Senior Creditors and Noteholders.’’ The Security Trustee may disregard any instructions from
any other person to enforce the Collateral and may disregard any instructions to enforce any Collateral
if those instructions are inconsistent with the Intercreditor Agreement. The Security Trustee is not
obligated to enforce the Collateral if it is not appropriately indemnified by the relevant creditors.

‘‘Pari Passu Debt Required Holders’’ means, in respect of any direction, approval, consent or
waiver, the Pari Passu Creditors of the principal amount of Pari Passu Liabilities required to vote in
favor of such direction, consent or waiver under the terms of the relevant Pari Passu Liabilities or, if
the required amount is not specified, the holders holding at least the majority of the principal amount
of the then outstanding Pari Passu Liabilities. For the avoidance of doubt, in determining whether the
_Pari Passu Creditors of the required principal amount of Pari Passu Liabilities have concurred in any_
direction, waiver or consent, Pari Passu Liabilities owed by any member of the Group, or by any Person
directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by or under direct or indirect common control with any
Obligor, will be considered as though not outstanding.

‘‘Secured Notes/Pari Passu Required Holders’’ means:

(a) the Notes Required Holders; and

(b) if applicable and if the aggregate amount of Pari Passu Liabilities is equal to more than
A50,000,000, the Pari Passu Debt Required Holders,

_provided that, if the instructions are received from only the Notes Required Holders (as defined below)_
or (subject to paragraph (b) above) only the Pari Passu Debt Required Holders, the instructions of that
responding class will prevail, and in the event that there is an inconsistency in instructions received
from the Notes Required Holders and (subject to paragraph (b) above) the Pari Passu Liabilities
Required Holders:

(i) if the Senior Secured Notes Liabilities is equal to or greater than the Pari Passu Liabilities, the
instructions of the Notes Required Holders will prevail; and

(ii) if the Pari Passu Liabilities are greater than the Senior Secured Notes Liabilities, the
instructions of the Pari Passu Liabilities Required Holders will prevail.

‘‘Notes Required Holders’’ means, in respect of any direction, approval, consent or waiver, the
Noteholders of the principal amount of Notes required to vote in favor of such direction, consent or
waiver under the terms of the Notes (treating any voting rights under the Indentures as applying to the
aggregated amount of the Notes) or, if the required amount is not specified, the holders holding at
least the majority of the principal amount of the then outstanding Notes, in accordance with the
Indentures. For the avoidance of doubt, in determining whether the Noteholders of the required
principal amount of Notes have concurred in any direction, waiver or consent, Notes owned by any
member of the Group will be considered as though not outstanding.

**_Limitation on Enforcement by Super Senior Creditors and Noteholders_**

If the RCF Agent or the Trustee or the Pari Passu Debt Representative wishes to instruct the
Security Trustee to commence enforcement of any Collateral, the RCF Agent, the Trustee and the Pari
_Passu Debt Representative (the ‘‘Secured Representatives’’) must consult with one another and with the_
Security Trustee in good faith with a view to coordinating these instructions for 30 days or such other
period as the Secured Representatives may agree. The definition of Secured Notes/Pari Passu Required
Holders provides that if instructions are not received from either (i) the Notes Required Holders or
(ii) the Pari Passu Debt Required Holders, the instructions of the responding class will prevail and in
the event that conflicting instructions are received from (i) and (ii), if the Senior Secured Notes
Liabilities are equal to or greater than the _Pari Passu Liabilities, the instructions of the Notes Required_

103


-----

Holders will prevail, and if the Pari Passu Liabilities are greater than the Senior Secured Notes
Liabilities, the instructions of the _Pari Passu Required Holders will prevail._

None of the Secured Representatives shall be obligated to consult before giving instructions to
enforce if:

(a) the relevant Collateral has become enforceable as a result of any insolvency proceedings
relating to such Obligor against whom such acceleration action has been taken or such debt
accelerated; or

(b) a Secured Representative determines in good faith (and notifies each other Secured
Representative and the Security Trustee) that to enter into such consultations and thereby
delay the commencement of enforcement of the Collateral could reasonably be expected to
have an adverse effect on:

(i) their ability to enforce any of the Collateral; or

(ii) the realization proceeds of any enforcement of the Collateral in any material respect.

Until the Secured Notes Discharge Date, if the Security Trustee has received conflicting
enforcement instructions then the Security Trustee will promptly notify the relevant Secured
Representatives and such Secured Representatives will consult with each other and the Security Trustee
for a period of not less than 15 days (or such other period as the relevant Secured Representatives may
agree) (the ‘‘Further Consultation Period’’), with a view to resolving the conflict in such instructions in
order to enforcement of the Collateral.

The Further Consultation Period will end immediately if:

(i) the Collateral has become enforceable as a result of insolvency proceedings; or

(ii) a Secured Representative determines in good faith (and notifies each other Secured
Representative and the Security Trustee) that to so consult and thereby delay commencement of
enforcement could reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect on (A) their ability to enforce
any of the Collateral or (B) the realization of proceeds of any enforcement of the Collateral in any
material respect.

The Security Trustee will only enforce Collateral if the Security Trustee has received instructions
from the Secured Notes/Pari Passu Required Holders (acting through the Trustee and/or the Pari Passu
Debt Representative) to enforce or direct the enforcement of the Collateral (regardless of whether or
not the Security Trustee has received conflicting instructions or sole instructions from the RCF Agent
to enforce or direct the enforcement of the Collateral save if the _Pari Passu Discharge Date and_
Secured Notes Discharge Date or the Six Months Date has occurred, whereupon the Security Trustee
shall enforce or direct the enforcement of such Collateral in accordance with the instructions it has
received.

A creditor representative may only give enforcement instructions that are consistent with the
Security Enforcement Principles, including that:

(i) it shall be the primary and overriding aim of any enforcement of the Collateral to achieve
the security enforcement objective (being to maximize so far as is consistent with prompt and
expeditious realization of value from enforcement of the Collateral, the recovery by the RCF
Lenders, the Hedge Counterparties, the Noteholders and the Pari Passu Creditors (together the
‘‘Secured Creditors’’ and herein, the ‘‘Security Enforcement Objective’’)):

(ii) the Collateral will be enforced and other enforcement action will be taken such that
either:

(a) all proceeds of enforcement are received by the Security Trustee in cash for
distribution in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement (see ‘‘—Application of
Proceeds’’); or

(b) sufficient proceeds from enforcement will be received by the Security Trustee in cash
to ensure that when the proceeds are applied in accordance with the Intercreditor
Agreement (see ‘‘—Application of Proceeds’’), the Super Senior Liabilities are repaid
and discharged in full (unless the RCF Agent agrees otherwise);

104


-----

(iii) the enforcement actions are prompt and expeditious to the extent reasonably achievable
_provided that they are consistent with the Security Enforcement Objective;_

(iv) to the extent that the Collateral that is the subject of the proposed enforcement action is:

(a) over assets other than shares in a member of the Group where the aggregate book
value of such assets exceeds A10,000,000 (or its equivalent) (‘‘Material Collateral’’);
or

(b) over some or all of the shares in a member of the Group,

then the Security Trustee shall (unless it is unnecessary in respect of enforcement proceedings in a
relevant jurisdiction or the enforcement proceedings are by way of public auction or through a courtsupervised process) appoint a ‘‘big four’’ accounting firm, any reputable and independent international
investment bank or other reputable and independent professional services firm with experience in
restructuring and enforcement (a ‘‘Financial Advisor’’) to opine (the ‘‘Financial Advisor’s Opinion’’) as
expert on:

(1) the optimal method of enforcing the Collateral so as to achieve the Security Enforcement
Principles and maximize the recovery of any such enforcement action;

(2) that the proceeds received from any such enforcement is fair from a financial point of
view after taking account all relevant circumstances; and

(3) that such sale is otherwise in accordance with the Security Enforcement Objective;

(v) the Financial Advisor’s Opinion (or any equivalent opinion obtained by the Security
Trustee in relation to any other enforcement of the Collateral that such action is fair from a
financial point of view after taking into account all relevant circumstances) will be conclusive
evidence that the Security Enforcement Objective has been met; and

(vi) in the event than an enforcement of the Collateral is over assets or shares referred to in
paragraph (iv) above and such enforcement is conducted by way of public or court auction, any
equity investors of the Group shall, subject to compliance with applicable law, be entitled to
participate in such auction.

**_Application of Proceeds_**

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that amounts received from the realization or enforcement
of all or any part of the Collateral will be applied in the following order of priority:

(a) first in payment of the fees, costs, expenses and liabilities of the RCF Agent, the Security
Trustee, the Pari Passu Debt Representative and of any receiver, delegate, attorney or agent
appointed under any Collateral documents or the Intercreditor Agreement or the Pari Passu
Liabilities documents and of the Trustee pari passu and ratably between such parties;

(b) second in payment of the balance of the costs and expenses of the RCF Lenders and the
Hedge Counterparties (together, the ‘‘Super Senior Creditors’’) (other than the Security Trustee,
any receiver or delegate) in connection with such realization or enforcement pari passu and ratably
between such parties;

(c) third, in payment to the RCF Agent and the Hedge Counterparties for application
towards the balance of each of the RCF Liabilities and the Hedging Liabilities pari passu and
ratably between such parties;

(d) fourth in payment pari passu and pro rata of the balance of:

(i) the costs and expenses of the Trustee on behalf of each Noteholder; and

(ii) the Pari Passu Debt Representative on behalf of each Pari Passu Creditor; and

(e) fifth, in payment: pari passu and pro rata to:

(i) the Trustee for application towards the balance of the Senior Secured Notes
Liabilities; and

(ii) the Pari Passu Debt Representative for application towards the balance of the Pari
_Passu Liabilities._

105


-----

**_Additional Indebtedness_**

In the event that any Obligor incurs any additional indebtedness that is permitted under the terms
of the Notes and the RCF Agreement to be secured by the Collateral, the creditors in respect of such
additional liabilities will share in the proceeds of any enforcement of Collateral on the basis and to the
extent permitted under the terms of the Notes and the RCF Agreement.

**_Release of the Guarantees and the Security_**

Where a disposal of an asset is being effected, the Intercreditor Agreement provides that the
Security Trustee is authorized (i) to release the Collateral or guarantee (and the relevant Obligors shall
release any Collateral given to them) where such releases are required to give effect to the
Intercreditor Agreement and the documents governing the Secured Liabilities or where such releases
are connected to a sale, transfer or other disposal of any assets, undertaking or business that is not
prohibited or is expressly permitted under the terms of the Finance Documents, and (ii) on
commencement of enforcement action to release that Obligor and any subsidiary of that Obligor from
all or any part of its liabilities to a member of the Group or a Secured Creditor such that no Secured
Liabilities remain attached to those assets being disposed of or any Obligor or subsidiary of that
Obligor in which shares are being disposed of.

**_Amendment_**

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that it may be amended with only the consent of the
Security Trustee, the Secured Notes/Pari Passu Required Holders, the RCF Agent, the Trustee and the
Hedge Counterparties save in respect of administrative changes or to correct manifest errors on the
instructions of the RCF Agent, the Pari Passu Debt Representative and the Trustee.

**_Option to Purchase: RCF Liabilities and Hedging Liabilities_**

After an Acceleration Event, the Trustee and the Pari Passu Debt Representative, at the direction
and expense of the Noteholders and the _Pari Passu Creditors (as applicable), will have the right to_
acquire or procure that a nominee acquires all (but not part only) of the Super Senior Liabilities.

Any such purchase will be on terms which will include, without limitation, payment in full in cash
of an amount equal to the Super Senior Liabilities then outstanding, including in respect of any broken
funding costs, as well as certain costs and expenses of the Super Senior Creditors; after the transfer, no
Super Senior Creditor will be under any actual or contingent liability to any person under the
Intercreditor Agreement; the purchasing Noteholders and Pari Passu Creditors indemnify each Super
Senior Creditor for any actual or alleged obligation to repay or claw back any amount received by such
Super Senior Creditor; and the relevant transfer shall be without recourse to, or warranty from, any
Super Senior Creditor save as to title and the absence of third-party interests, power and authority and
completion of know-your-customer checks.

**DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES**

Lecta S.A. will issue A225 million Floating Rate Senior Secured Notes due 2022 (the ‘‘Floating
Rate Notes’’) under an indenture (the ‘‘Floating Rate Notes Indenture’’) among itself, the Floating
Rate Notes Guarantors, Deutsche Trustee Company Limited, as trustee for the holders of the Floating
Rate Notes (the ‘‘Floating Rate Notes Trustee’’), Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, as security
trustee (the ‘‘Security Trustee’’), and other parties named therein. The terms of the Floating Rate
Notes will be stated in the Floating Rate Notes Indenture. The Floating Rate Notes issued on the Issue
Date will be denominated in euro and bear interest with reference to EURIBOR (subject to a 0%
floor) as described below. The Floating Rate Notes Indenture is unlimited in aggregate principal
amount subject to the provisions of the Floating Rate Notes Indenture, although the issuance of
Floating Rate Notes on the Issue Date (as defined below) will be limited to A225 million.

Lecta S.A. will issue A375 million 6[1]⁄2% Senior Secured Notes due 2023 (the ‘‘Fixed Rate Notes’’
and together with the Floating Rate Notes, the ‘‘Notes’’) under an indenture (the ‘‘Fixed Rate Notes
Indenture’’ and together with the Floating Rate Notes Indenture, the ‘‘Indentures’’) among itself, the
Fixed Rate Notes Guarantors, Deutsche Trustee Company Limited, as trustee for the holders of the
Fixed Rate Notes (the ‘‘Fixed Rate Notes Trustee’’ and together with its capacity as Floating Rate Note
Trustee, the ‘‘Trustee’’), the Security Trustee and other parties named therein. The terms of the Fixed
Rate Notes will be stated in the Fixed Rate Notes Indenture. The Fixed Rate Notes issued on the Issue
Date will be denominated in euro. The Fixed Rate Notes Indenture will be unlimited in aggregate
principal amount subject to the provisions of the Fixed Rate Notes Indenture, although the issuance of
Fixed Rate Notes on the Issue Date (as defined below) will be limited to A375 million.

Certain terms used in this description are defined under the heading ‘‘—Certain definitions.’’ In
this description: (i) the ‘‘Company’’ refers only to Lecta S.A. and not to any of its Subsidiaries; and
(ii) ‘‘Guarantor’’ refers only to such Guarantor and not to any of its Subsidiaries.

The following description is only a summary of the material provisions of the Indentures. It does
not restate the Indentures in their entirety. You should read the relevant Indenture because it, not this
description, defines your rights as Holders. You may request copies of the relevant Indenture at the
address set forth under the heading ‘‘Where you can find more information’’ and, for so long as the
Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the rules of the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, may inspect copies of such documents at the office of the
Registrar in Luxembourg. The Indentures will not be qualified under and will not incorporate by
reference or be subject to any provisions of the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended.

The Holder of a Note will be treated as the owner of the Note for all purposes. Only the Holder
will have rights under the Indentures.

**Brief description of the Notes**

The Notes:

  - will be senior secured obligations of the Company;

  - will rank at least pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future Debt of the
Company that is not subordinated to the Notes;

  - will rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future Subordinated Obligations of the
Company;

  - will be structurally subordinated to all liabilities (including trade payables), disqualified stock
and preferred stock of the Company’s Subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes; and

  - will benefit from additional credit enhancement provided by the Company and certain
Subsidiaries of the Company.

Credit enhancement for the Notes will include: (i) guarantees of the Notes by certain Subsidiaries
of the Company and (ii) the pledge to the Security Trustee of the Intercompany Loans and the other
Collateral (as defined below).

The guarantees of the Notes by Subsidiaries of the Company will be secured in some, but not all,
instances by certain assets of the Subsidiary issuing such guarantee. Only some of the Subsidiaries of
the Company will guarantee the Notes, and most of those guarantees are subject to significant

107


-----

limitations. The credit enhancement and the associated limitations of the guarantees in respect of the
Notes are more fully described below under ‘‘—Credit enhancement’’ and in Annex A to the Offering
Memorandum.

As of the date of the Indentures, all of the Company’s Subsidiaries will be ‘‘Restricted
Subsidiaries.’’ However, under the circumstances described below under the definition of Unrestricted
Subsidiaries, the Company will be permitted to designate certain of its Subsidiaries as ‘‘Unrestricted
Subsidiaries.’’ Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants in the
Indentures. Those of the Company’s Subsidiaries that are Guarantors are all Restricted Subsidiaries
and, subject in each case to significant limitations under applicable law (as more specifically set out
below under ‘‘—Credit enhancement—Guarantees’’), will be jointly and severally liable with respect to
the Company’s obligations under the Notes.

The Company is a holding company with limited assets and operates its business through its
Subsidiaries. Any right of the Company and its creditors, including Holders of the Notes, to participate
in the assets of any of the Company’s Subsidiaries that is not a Guarantor upon the bankruptcy,
liquidation or reorganization of any such Subsidiary will (except insofar as the Company has a claim
against such Subsidiary for intercompany debt) be subject to the prior claims of the creditors of such
Subsidiary, including but not limited to trade creditors. Claims by the Trustee against a Guarantor on
behalf of the Holders of the Notes will be direct claims on that Guarantor. However, some of the
Guarantors are themselves holding companies, and hence claims under a Guarantee will be structurally
subordinated to the prior claims of the creditors of the Subsidiaries of such Guarantors, including but
not limited to trade creditors.

**Principal, Maturity and Interest**

The Company will issue the Fixed Rate Notes in an initial aggregate principal amount of
A375 million. The Fixed Rate Notes will mature on August 1, 2023. The Company will issue the
Floating Rate Notes in an initial aggregate principal amount of A225 million. The Floating Rate Notes
will mature on August 1, 2022. The Company will issue the Notes in denominations of A100,000 and
integral multiples of A1,000 above A100,000. Notes in denominations of less than A100,000 will not be
available. Subject to the Company’s compliance with the covenant described under the heading
‘‘—Certain covenants—Limitation on Debt,’’ the Company is permitted to issue additional Notes from
time to time under the Indentures in an unlimited principal amount (the ‘‘Additional Notes’’). The
Notes and the Additional Notes, if any, will be treated as a single class for all purposes of the relevant
Indenture, including waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase. Unless the context
otherwise requires, for all purposes of the relevant Indentures and this ‘‘Description of the Notes,’’
references to the Notes include any Additional Notes actually issued. Each of the Fixed Rate Notes
and Floating Rate Notes will constitute a separate series of Notes, but unless otherwise specified shall
be treated as a single class for all purposes under the Indentures, including in respect of any
amendment, waiver or other modification of the Indentures or any other action by the Holders of the
Notes hereunder, including but not limited to enforcement in respect of the Notes and except as
otherwise provided in the Indentures.

**_Fixed Rate Notes_**

Interest on the Fixed Rate Notes will accrue at the rate of 6[1]⁄2% per annum. Interest on the Fixed
Rate Notes will be payable semi-annually in arrears on each Fixed Rate Interest Payment Date
commencing February 1, 2017 to the person in whose name the Fixed Rate Note is registered on the
relevant record date as stated below. Interest on the Fixed Rate Notes will accrue from the most recent
date to which interest has been paid or, if no interest has been paid, from and including the Issue
Date. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprising twelve 30-day months.

‘‘Fixed Rate Interest Payment Date’’ means February 1 and August 1 in each year from and
including February 1, 2017. If any Fixed Rate Interest Payment Date would otherwise fall on a day
which is not a Business Day, it shall be postponed to the next day which is a Business Day unless it
would then fall into the next calendar month, in which event, the Fixed Rate Interest Payment Date
shall be brought forward to the immediately preceding Business Day. The Company will make each
interest payment to the Holders of record on the immediately preceding January 15 and July 15.

-----

**_Floating Rate Notes_**

The Floating Rate Notes will bear interest at a rate per annum (the ‘‘Applicable Rate’’), reset
quarterly two days prior to the beginning of each quarterly interest period, equal to EURIBOR
(subject to a zero floor) plus 637.5 basis points as determined by the calculation agent for the Floating
Rate Notes (the ‘‘Calculation Agent’’), which will initially be Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, or
any successor thereof.

Interest on the Floating Rate Notes will be payable quarterly in arrears on each Floating Rate
Interest Payment Date commencing November 1, 2016 to the person in whose name the Floating Rate
Note is registered on the relevant record date as stated below. Interest on the Floating Rate Notes will
accrue from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or, if no interest has been paid, from
and including the Issue Date.

‘‘Determination Date’’ with respect to an Interest Period, will be the day that is two TARGET
Settlement Days preceding the first day of such Interest Period.

‘‘EURIBOR’’ with respect to an Interest Period, will be the rate (expressed as a percentage per
annum) for deposits in euro for a three-month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET
Settlement Days after the Determination Date that appears on Telerate Page 248 as of 11:00 a.m.,
Brussels time, on the Determination Date. If Telerate Page 248 does not include such a rate or is
unavailable on a Determination Date, the Company will request the principal London, Frankfurt, Paris,
Milan or Madrid office of each of four major banks in the Euro-zone inter-bank market, as selected by
the Company, to provide such bank’s offered quotation (expressed as a percentage per annum) as of
approximately 11:00 a.m., Brussels time, on such Determination Date, to prime banks in the Euro-zone
inter-bank market for deposits in a Representative Amount in euro for a three-month period beginning
on the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days after the Determination Date. If at least two such
offered quotations are so provided, the rate for the Interest Period will be the arithmetic mean of such
quotations. If fewer than two such quotations are so provided, the Company will request each of three
major banks in London, Frankfurt, Paris, Milan or Madrid, as selected by the Company, to provide
such bank’s rate (expressed as a percentage per annum), as of approximately 11:00 a.m., London time,
on such Determination Date, for loans in a Representative Amount in euro to leading European banks
for a three-month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days after the
Determination Date. If at least two such rates are so provided, the rate for the Interest Period will be
the arithmetic mean of such rates. If fewer than two such rates are so provided then the rate for the
Interest Period will be the rate in effect with respect to the immediately preceding Interest Period. In
the event the Issuer requests quotations or rates as described above, it will provide an Officer’s
Certificate to the Calculation Agent setting forth in reasonable detail the results of such requests as
soon as reasonably possible after 11:00 a.m., Brussels time, on the Determination Date.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if for any Interest Period the rate determined based on the procedure
specified in this paragraph is less than 0%, EURIBOR shall mean 0% for purposes of determining the
Applicable Rate for such Interest Period.

‘‘Euro-zone’’ means the region comprising member states of the European Union that adopt the
euro.

‘‘Floating Rate Interest Payment Date’’ means February 1, May 1, August 1 and November 1 in each
year from and including November 1, 2016. If any Floating Rate Interest Payment Date would
otherwise fall on a day which is not a Business Day, it shall be postponed to the next day which is a
Business Day unless it would then fall into the next calendar month, in which event, the Floating Rate
Interest Payment Date shall be brought forward to the immediately preceding Business Day. The
Company will make each interest payment to the Holders of record on the immediately preceding
January 15, April 15, July 15 and October 15.

‘‘Interest Period’’ means each successive period commencing on, and including, a Floating Rate
Interest Payment Date and ending on, but excluding, the next succeeding Floating Rate Interest
Payment Date, with the exception that the first Interest Period will commence on, and include, the
Issue Date and end on, but exclude, November 1, 2016 and the final Interest Period shall end on, but
exclude, the date of final maturity.

‘‘Representative Amount’’ means the greater of (a) A1,000,000 and (b) an amount that is
representative for a single transaction in the relevant market at the relevant time.

109


-----

‘‘TARGET Settlement Day’’ means any day on which the Trans-European Automated Real-Time
Gross Settlement Express Transfer (TARGET2) System is open.

‘‘Telerate Page 248’’ means, the display page so designated on Bridge’s Telerate Service (or such
other page as may replace that page on that service, or such other service as may be nominated as the
information vendor).

The Calculation Agent will, as soon as practicable after 11:00 a.m. (Brussels time) on each
Determination Date, determine the Applicable Rate, and calculate the aggregate amount of interest
payable on the Floating Rate Notes in respect of the following Interest Period (the ‘‘Interest
Amount’’). The Interest Amount will be calculated by applying the Applicable Rate to the principal
amount of Floating Rate Notes outstanding at the commencement of the Interest Period, multiplying
each such amount by the actual number of days in the Interest Period concerned divided by 360.

All percentages resulting from any of the above calculations will be rounded, if necessary, to the
nearest one hundred thousandth of a percentage point, with five one-millionths of a percentage point
being rounded upwards (e.g., 4.876545% (or .04876545) being rounded to 4.87655% (or .0487655)). All
euro amounts used in or resulting from such calculations will be rounded to the nearest euro cent (with
one-half euro cent being rounded upwards). The determination of the Applicable Rate and the Interest
Amount by the Calculation Agent shall, in the absence of willful default, bad faith or manifest error, be
binding on all parties.

The interest rate on the Floating Rate Notes will in no event be higher than the maximum rate
permitted by New York law as the same may be modified by any United States law of general
application.

Upon each determination of the Interest Amount, so long as the Floating Rate Notes are listed on
the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted for trading on the Euro MTF
Market of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, to the extent required by the Luxembourg Stock
Exchange, the Company will inform Holders thereof through the relevant clearing systems and will
make such determination available during normal business hours at the offices of the Registrar in
Luxembourg. The Calculation Agent will, upon the request of the Holder of any Floating Rate Note,
provide the interest rate then in effect with respect to the Floating Rate Notes.

The rights of Holders of beneficial interests in the Floating Rate Notes to receive the payments of
interest on the Floating Rate Notes are subject to applicable procedures of the book-entry depositary
and Euroclear and Clearstream.

**Optional redemption**

**_Fixed Rate Notes_**

The Fixed Rate Notes will not be redeemable at the option of the Company prior to August,
2019, except as described herein and in ‘‘—Optional tax redemption.’’

Fixed Rate Notes at a redemption price of 106.500% of the principal amount of the Fixed Rate Notes
being redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date, with the net
proceeds from one or more Public Equity Offerings. The Company may only do this, however, if:

The Company may acquire Fixed Rate Notes by means other than a redemption, whether by
tender offer, open market purchases, negotiated transactions or otherwise, in accordance with
applicable securities laws, so long as such acquisition does not otherwise violate the terms of the Fixed
Rate Notes Indenture.

**_Floating Rate Notes_**

The Floating Rate Notes will not be redeemable at the option of the Company prior to August 1,
2017, except as described herein and in ‘‘—Optional tax redemption.’’

**_Optional Redemption prior to August 1, 2017_**

The Company may acquire Floating Rate Notes by means other than a redemption, whether by
tender offer, open market purchases, negotiated transactions or otherwise, in accordance with
applicable securities laws, so long as such acquisition does not otherwise violate the terms of the
Floating Rate Notes Indenture.

**Selection and notice of redemption**

If less than all of any series of Notes is to be redeemed at any time, the Principal Paying Agent or
the Registrar will select Notes for redemption in compliance with the requirements of the principal
securities exchange, if any, on which that series of Notes are listed, and in compliance with the
requirements of Euroclear or Clearstream, or if the Notes are not so listed or such exchange prescribes
no method of selection and the Notes are not held through Euroclear or Clearstream, or Euroclear or
Clearstream prescribes no method of selection, on a pro rata basis by use of a pool factor; provided,
_however, that no Definitive Registered Note of A100,000 in aggregate principal amount or less shall be_
redeemed in part and only Notes in integral multiples of A1,000 will be redeemed. Neither the Principal
Paying Agent nor the Registrar will be liable for any selections made in accordance with this paragraph.

111


-----

If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that Note will
state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. The Company will issue a new Note
in a principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of the original Note in the name of the Holder
upon cancellation of the original Note.

Subject to the terms of the applicable redemption notice and the provisions set forth under
‘‘—Satisfaction and Discharge,’’ Notes called for redemption become due on the date fixed for
redemption. If the Company elects to redeem the Notes or portions thereof and requests the Trustee to
distribute to the Holders of the Notes any amounts deposited in trust (which, for the avoidance of
doubt, will include accrued and unpaid interest to the date fixed for redemption) prior to the date fixed
for redemption in accordance with the provisions set forth under ‘‘—Satisfaction and Discharge,’’ the
applicable redemption notice will state that Holders of the Notes will receive such amounts deposited
in trust prior to the date fixed for redemption and mention the payment date. On and after the
redemption date, interest will cease to accrue on the Notes or portions thereof called for redemption
(unless the Company defaults in providing the funds for such redemption) and such Notes will cease to
be outstanding.

Any redemption and notice of redemption of Notes may, at the Company’s discretion, be subject
to the satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent (including, without limitation, the Incurrence of
Debt the proceeds of which will be used to redeem the Notes). In addition, if such redemption or
notice is subject to satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, such notice may state that, at the
Company’s discretion, the redemption date may be delayed until such time as any or all such conditions
shall be satisfied, or such redemption may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event
that any or all such conditions shall not have been satisfied by the redemption date, or by the
redemption date so delayed; provided that in no case shall the notice have been delivered less than
10 days or more than 60 days prior to the date on which such redemption (if any) occurs.

So long as any Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and
admitted to trading on the Euro MTF Market of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the rules of the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, the Company will provide a copy of all notices to the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange.

Neither the Trustee, the Paying Agent nor the Registrar will be liable for selections made by it
under this ‘‘—Selection and notice of redemption.’’

**Sinking Fund**

The Company is not required to make mandatory sinking fund payments with respect to the Notes.

**Additional Amounts**

All payments made under or with respect to the Notes or any Guarantee shall be made free and
clear of and without withholding or deduction for or on account of any present or future tax, duty, levy,
impost, assessment or other governmental charge of whatever nature (including penalties, interest and
other liabilities related thereto) (hereinafter ‘‘Taxes’’), unless the withholding or deduction is required
by law.

If any deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf
of (1) the government of any of the countries in which any of the Company or the relevant Guarantor
and, in each case, any successor thereof (each, a ‘‘Payor’’) is organized or incorporated or any political
subdivision or any authority or agency therein or thereof having power to tax, (2) any other jurisdiction
in which a Payor is engaged in business for tax purposes or otherwise resident for tax purposes, or
(3) any jurisdiction from or through which any payment under or with respect to the Notes or any
Guarantee is made (each, a ‘‘Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction’’) will at any time be required from any
payment made under or with respect to the Notes or a Guarantee, as applicable, such Payor will be
required to pay such additional amounts (‘‘Additional Amounts’’) as may be necessary so that the net
amount received in respect of such payments after such withholding or deduction (including any such
deduction or withholding from such Additional Amounts) will equal the amount that would have been
received if such Taxes had not been withheld or deducted; provided, however, that the foregoing
obligation to pay Additional Amounts does not apply to: (1) any Taxes that would not have been
imposed but for the existence of any present or former connection between the relevant Holder (or
between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member or shareholder of, or possessor of power over, the

112


-----

relevant Holder, if the relevant Holder is an estate, nominee, partnership, limited liability corporation,
trust or corporation) and the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction, including such Holder (or such fiduciary,
settlor, beneficiary, partner, member, shareholder, or possessor) of the Notes being or having been a
citizen, resident, or national thereof or being or having been present or engaged in a trade or business
therein or having or having had a permanent establishment therein, other than a connection resulting
from the mere receipt of such payment or the ownership, holding, or enforcement of such Note or
Guarantee; (2) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, transfer, personal property tax or similar Tax; (3) any
withholding or deduction in respect of the Notes or any Guarantee (a) presented (where presentation
is required) for payment by or on behalf of a Holder who would have been able to avoid such
withholding or deduction by presenting the Notes to any other paying agent in a European Union
Member State, or (b) where the payment could have been made without such deduction or withholding
if the Notes had been presented for payment (where presentation is required) within 30 days after
(i) the date on which such payment became due and payable, or (ii) the date on which payment thereof
is duly provided for, whichever is later (except to the extent that the Holder would have been entitled
to Additional Amounts had the Notes been presented during such 30-day period); (4) any Taxes
imposed with respect to any payment of principal of (or premium, if any, on) or interest on the Notes
by a Payor to any Holder who is a fiduciary or partnership or any Person other than the sole beneficial
owner of such payment, to the extent that a beneficiary or settlor with respect to such fiduciary, a
member of such a partnership or the beneficial owner of such payment would not have been entitled to
the Additional Amounts had such beneficiary, settlor, member or beneficial owner been the actual
Holder of such Notes; (5) any Taxes that are payable other than by deduction or withholding from
payments made under or with respect to the Notes; (6) any Taxes that would not have been imposed
but for the failure of the Holder and/or beneficial owner to comply with the Payor’s or the Paying
Agent’s reasonable and timely request, in accordance with the ‘‘—Notices’’ provision herein, to the
Holder or beneficial owner to provide certification, documentation, information or other evidence
concerning the nationality, residence, identity or connection with the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction of the
Holder and/or beneficial owner of such Notes or to make any valid or timely declaration or similar
claim or satisfy any other reporting requirement relating to such matters (to the extent such Holder or
beneficial owner is legally eligible to do so), whether required or imposed by statute, treaty, regulation
or administrative practice of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction, as a precondition to exemption from, or
reduction in the rate of withholding or deduction of, Taxes imposed by the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction,
except if not reasonably available to the Holder and/or the beneficial owner for a reason different than
its nationality, tax residence, identity or connection with the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction of the Holder
and/or beneficial owner; _provided that, in this case, other reasonable certification, documentation,_
information or other evidence is provided concerning the nationality, tax residence, identity or
connection with the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction of the Holder and/or beneficial owner of such Notes;
(7) any Taxes that are imposed or withheld pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the U.S. Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the ‘‘Code’’), any regulations promulgated thereunder, any official
interpretations thereof, any intergovernmental agreement between a non-U.S. jurisdiction and the
United States with respect to the foregoing, any similar law or regulation adopted pursuant to such
intergovernmental agreement or any agreements entered into pursuant to Section 1471(b)(1) of the
Code; (8) any Taxes levied under Luxembourg Law of 23 December 2005 introducing a final
withholding tax on certain savings interest payments, as amended; or (9) any combination of any of the
above.

Such Additional Amounts also will not be payable where, had the beneficial owner of the Note
been the Holder, it would not have been entitled to payment of Additional Amounts by reason of
clauses (1) to (8) inclusive above.

The Payor will (i) make any required withholding or deduction and (ii) remit the full amount
deducted or withheld to the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction in accordance with applicable law. The Payor
will use all reasonable efforts to provide the Trustee with certified copies of tax receipts (or, if such
certified copies are not available using all reasonable efforts, such other evidence reasonably acceptable
to the Trustee in its discretion), evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld from
each Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes. The Payor will attach to each certified copy (or
other documentation) a certificate stating (x) that the amount of such Tax evidenced by the certified
copy (or other documentation) was paid in connection with payments in respect of the Notes then
outstanding and (y) the amount of such Tax paid per A1,000 of principal amount of the Notes.

113


-----

At least 30 days prior to each date on which any payment under or with respect to the Notes or
any Guarantee, as the case may be, is due and payable (unless such obligation to pay Additional
Amounts arises shortly before or after the 30th day prior to such date, in which case it shall be
promptly thereafter), if the Payor will be obligated to pay Additional Amounts with respect to such
payment, the Payor will deliver to the Trustee and the Paying Agent an Officer’s Certificate stating the
fact that such Additional Amounts will be payable and the amounts so payable and will set forth such
other information necessary to enable the Paying Agent to pay such Additional Amounts on the
payment date. The Trustee and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to rely absolutely upon each such
Officer’s Certificate until receipt of a further Officer’s Certificate addressing such matters.

Whenever in the Indentures or this Description of the Notes there is mentioned, in any context:

(1) the payment of principal;

(2) redemption prices or purchase prices in connection with a redemption or purchase of
Notes;

(3) interest; or

(4) any other amount payable on or with respect to any of the Notes or Note Guarantees,

such reference will be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts as described under this
heading to the extent that, in such context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in
respect thereof.

The Company will pay any present or future stamp, court, issue, registration or documentary Taxes
or any other excise or property Taxes (other than net wealth Taxes or similar Taxes imposed on the
Holder irrespective of such Holder’s investment in the Notes and based on the total net value of the
Holder’s property), charges or similar levies that arise in any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction from the
execution, delivery, enforcement or registration of the Notes, the Guarantees, the Indentures or any
other document or instrument in relation thereto (other than a transfer of the Notes that occurs after
the initial sale by the Initial Purchaser), or the receipt of any payments with respect thereto (limited,
solely in the case of Taxes attributable to the receipt of any payments with respect thereto, to any such
Taxes imposed in a Relevant Tax Jurisdiction that are not excluded under clauses (1) through (4) and
(6) through (7) of the second paragraph of this ‘‘Additional Amounts’’ section above, or any
combination thereof) except, for Luxembourg registration duties purposes, in case of a voluntary
registration by a Holder, where such registration is not necessary to enforce, maintain or preserve its
rights.

The obligations described under this heading will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge
of the Indentures or any Guarantee, and will apply, mutatis mutandis, to any jurisdiction in which any
successor Person to the Payor is then organized, incorporated, engaged in business for tax purposes or
otherwise resident for tax purposes, or any jurisdiction from or through which any payment under or
with respect to the Notes or any Guarantee is made, and any political subdivision or taxing authority or
agency thereof or therein having the power to tax.

**Optional tax redemption**

The Company is entitled to redeem the Notes in whole, but not in part, at its option, at any time,
upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice (which notice shall be irrevocable), at 100% of the
principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption and all
Additional Amounts (if any) then due and that will become due on or before such date as a result of
the redemption or otherwise (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant record date to
receive interest due on the Floating Interest Payment Date or Fixed Rate Interest Payment Date, as
applicable), in the event the Company or Guarantor (as the case may be) has become or would become
obligated to pay, on the next date on which any amount would be payable with respect to the Notes,
Additional Amounts (but in the case of a Guarantor, only if the payment giving rise to such
requirement cannot be made by the Company or another Guarantor without the obligation to pay
Additional Amounts) as a result of:

(1) a change in or an amendment to the laws (including any regulations promulgated
thereunder) of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction affecting taxation; or

114


-----

(2) any change in or amendment to any official position regarding the application or
interpretation of such laws or regulations (each of (1) and (2) a ‘‘Change in Tax
Laws’’),

which change or amendment has not been publicly announced before and which becomes effective on
or after the Issue Date (or, if the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction was not a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction
on the Issue Date, the date on which such Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction became a Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction under the Indentures) and the Company or Guarantor (as the case may be) cannot avoid
such obligation by taking reasonable measures available to it.

No such notice of redemption may be given (i) earlier than 90 days prior to the earliest date on
which the Company or Guarantor (as the case may be) would be obligated to pay such Additional
Amounts were a payment in respect of the Notes then due and payable and (ii) unless at the time such
notice is given, the obligation to pay Additional Amounts remains in effect.

Before the Company publishes or mails notice of redemption of the Notes as described above, it
will deliver to the Trustee (i) an Officer’s Certificate to the effect that the Company or any Guarantor
(as the case may be) cannot avoid its obligation to pay Additional Amounts by taking reasonable
measures available to it (but, in the case of a Guarantor, only if the payment giving rise to such
requirement cannot be made by the Company or another Guarantor without the obligation to pay
Additional Amounts) and (ii) an opinion in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee
(such approval not to be unreasonably withheld) of independent legal counsel of recognized standing
stating that the Company or Guarantor (as the case may be) is or would be obligated to pay Additional
Amounts as a result of a Change in Tax Laws. The Trustee shall be entitled to accept such Officer’s
Certificate and opinion as sufficient evidence of the satisfaction of the conditions precedent described
above, in which event it will be conclusive and binding on the Holders.

The foregoing provisions will apply mutatis mutandis to any successor person to the Company or
Guarantor after such successor person becomes a party to either Indenture, with respect to a Change
in Tax Laws that is publicly announced and becomes effective after the time such successor Person
becomes a party to the applicable Indenture.

For so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and
admitted for trading on the Euro MTF Market of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, and to the extent
the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, the Company will provide a copy of any such
notice to the Luxembourg Stock Exchange. Notices of redemption will be given in accordance with the
provisions set forth under ‘‘—Selection and notice of redemption.’’

**Credit enhancement**

**_Overview_**

Credit enhancement for the Notes will include on or about the Issue Date:

  - the Guarantees to be granted by Sub Lecta S.A. (a Luxembourg soci´et´e anonyme), Cartiere del
Garda S.p.A. (an Italian corporation), Condat Holding S.A.S. (a French soci´et´e par actions
_simplifi´ee), Condat S.A.S. (a French soci´et´e par actions simplifi´ee), Torraspapel S.A. (a Spanish_
_sociedad an´onima) and Polyedra S.p.A. (an Italian corporation); and_

  - the pledge or assignment in favor of the Security Trustee of the Intercompany Loans held by
the Company and a pledge of the shares in Sub Lecta S.A. held by the Company, in addition
to a pledge or assignment in favor of the Security Trustee by Subsidiaries of the Company and
by the Company with respect to other Collateral.

Each Guarantee (other than the Guarantee to be provided by Polyedra S.p.A.) will be secured by
certain of the assets of the Subsidiary issuing that Guarantee. Not all of the Subsidiaries of the
Company will guarantee the Notes, and most of the Guarantees will be subject to significant
limitations. The aggregate unconsolidated EBITDA (i.e., the sum of the EBITDA of the Company and
the Guarantors without giving effect to any eliminations that would arise upon consolidation of the
Company and its Subsidiaries) for the twelve months ended March 31, 2016, as reported in the
respective stand-alone financial statements of the Guarantors, was A90.6 million. This represented 80%
of the Company’s consolidated EBITDA for the same period. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Related to the
Notes and Our Structure—The Guarantees are significantly limited by applicable laws and are subject
to certain limitations or defences.’’

115


-----

Through a series of intercompany loans and by means of certain intra-group transactions, the
Company and certain of its Subsidiaries intend to amend, modify and/or replace the existing
intercompany proceeds loans relating to the Existing Notes as well as enter into a new fixed rate
intercompany loan (the ‘‘Intercompany Loans’’). See ‘‘—Intercompany Loans’’ and ‘‘—Certain
covenants—Modification of the Intercompany Loans.’’

The credit enhancement arrangements for the Notes vary from Subsidiary to Subsidiary depending
on applicable legal restrictions and other factors. Moreover, these arrangements may be limited in
amount and scope, and those limitations are significant. A summary of the credit enhancement
arrangements by Subsidiary is attached to the Offering Memorandum as Annex A, and you are urged
to review that appendix in connection with making your investment decision.

**_Post-Closing Actions_**

As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, Condat Holding S.A.S. is a wholly-owned subsidiary
of Cartiere del Garda S.p.A. On or about the Issue Date, Cartiere del Garda S.p.A. will transfer its
shareholding in Condat Holding S.A.S. to Torraspapel S.A. Torraspapel S.A. will enter into a pledge
agreement in favor of the Security Trustee with respect to the entire issued share capital of Condat
Holding S.A.S., which shall form part of the Collateral.

Torraspapel S.A. intends to transfer its distribution business to a Spanish entity within the Group,
its direct Subsidiary Dispap S.A. (the ‘‘Permitted Reorganization’’). Should Torraspapel S.A. transfer
this business, we have agreed that, within 15 calendar days of such transfer, Dispap S.A. (currently a
dormant Subsidiary with no operations) will provide a Guarantee with respect to the Notes and both
Dispap S.A. and Torraspapel S.A. will provide security interests in certain assets that will form part of
the Collateral. More specifically:

  - Dispap S.A. shall execute supplemental indentures and become a Guarantor of the Notes;

  - Torraspapel S.A. will enter into a pledge agreement in favor of the Security Trustee with
respect to the entire issued share capital of Dispap S.A., which shall form part of the
Collateral;

  - Sub Lecta S.A. will enter into pledges or assignments in favor of the Security Trustee with
respect to certain receivables payable by Dispap S.A., which shall form part of the Collateral;
and

  - Dispap S.A. will enter into pledges or assignments in favor of the Security Trustee with
respect to certain receivables and bank accounts, which shall form part of the Collateral.

While the Company currently intends to transfer the distribution business of Torraspapel S.A. to
Dispap S.A., there is no obligation to do so.

**_Guarantees_**

Each Guarantor will jointly and severally guarantee, subject to limitations described in Annex A
hereto, as a general unsubordinated obligation, and as a primary obligor and not merely as a surety,
the Company’s obligations under the Notes and the Indentures. In addition, each Guarantor will agree
to pay any and all costs and expenses (including counsel fees and expenses) incurred by the Trustee or
the Holders in enforcing any rights under the Guarantees. The Guarantee of the Notes by each
Guarantor will be a general unsubordinated obligation of such Guarantor and:

  - will rank at least pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future Debt that is not
subordinated to such guarantee;

  - will rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future subordinated obligations of such
Guarantor;

  - will be secured by a security interest in favor of the Security Trustee in certain of its assets
(other than the Guarantee to be provided by Polyedra S.p.A.), including shares in certain
Subsidiaries, but not all assets and no real property; and

  - will be effectively subordinated to any existing and future Debt of such Subsidiary that is
secured with assets that do not secure such guarantee, to the extent of the value of the assets
securing such Debt.

116


-----

The obligations of each Guarantor under its Guarantee will be limited to an amount that can be
guaranteed under applicable laws, including corporate benefit laws and financial assistance, fraudulent
conveyance or fraudulent transfer restrictions under applicable insolvency laws, and will not apply to
the extent a guarantee would be illegal or unenforceable under applicable local laws. We expect that
the maximum principal amounts of the Guarantees to be provided by certain of the Guarantors on the
Issue Date will be limited based on the valuation of the Guarantor, and will be no less than the
following amounts: Sub Lecta S.A.: aggregate principal amount of the Notes; Cartiere del
Garda S.p.A.: A32.0 million; Condat Holding S.A.S.: A23.8 million; Condat S.A.S.: A23.8 million;
Torraspapel S.A.: A588.2 million; and Polyedra S.p.A.: A3.0 million. To the extent Dispap S.A. provides
a Guarantee subsequent to the Issue Date, we expect that the maximum aggregate principal amount of
such Guarantee would be approximately A30 million, but there is no assurance that this Guarantee will
be provided or that it will be up to such maximum amount. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Related to the
Notes and Our Structure—The Guarantees are significantly limited by applicable laws and are subject
to certain limitations or defences’’ and Annex A hereto. The Guarantees will provide that, in the event
of default in the payment of principal of or premium, if any, interest, Additional Amounts, if any, and
any other payment obligations in respect of the Notes (including any obligation to repurchase the
Notes), the Trustee may institute legal proceedings directly against the relevant Guarantor without first
proceeding against the Company. The Trustee (acting of its own volition or on the direction of the
Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes), and not the Holders of
the Notes individually, may enforce the Guarantees and provide directions to the Security Trustee
pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement to enforce the security for the Guarantees.

**_Intercompany Loans_**

Through the Intercompany Loans and certain intra-group transactions, (i) the Company intends to
amend, supplement, modify and/or replace the existing intercompany proceeds loans to Sub Lecta S.A.
relating to the Existing Notes, (ii) in turn, Sub Lecta S.A. intends to amend, supplement, modify and/or
replace the existing intercompany proceeds loans to Torraspapel S.A. relating to the Existing Notes,
(iii) in turn, Torraspapel S.A. intends to amend, modify and/or replace the existing intercompany
proceeds loans to Condat Holding S.A.S. relating to the Existing Notes, and (iv) in turn, Condat
Holding S.A.S. intends to amend, modify and/or replace the existing intercompany proceeds loans to
Condat S.A.S. relating to the Existing Notes. As a result of these changes, following the Offerings the
Company will have made Intercompany Loans to Sub Lecta S.A., which will have made Intercompany
Loans to Torraspapel S.A., which will have made an Intercompany Loan to Condat Holding S.A.S. and
capital injections into Cartiere del Garda S.p.A. and Polyedra S.p.A. The Company’s rights under the
Intercompany Loans will be pledged by the Company as security to the Security Trustee. In the event
of a default in payment on the Notes, the Intercompany Loans assigned by the Company, Sub
Lecta S.A., Torraspapel S.A. and Condat Holding S.A.S. would provide the Trustee with senior claims
on behalf of the Holders of the Notes for payment directly against those Subsidiaries who received
such loans. If the Permitted Reorganization takes place then up to A5 million of the Intercompany
Loans from Sub Lecta S.A. to Torraspapel S.A. will be novated to Dispap S.A.

Interest will accrue on the Intercompany Loans at rates at least equal to the interest rates payable
on the Fixed Rate Notes and the Floating Rate Notes, respectively, with such adjustments as may be
necessary to match any Additional Amounts, premium or default interest due with respect to the Fixed
Rate Notes or Floating Rate Notes, as the case may be. The Intercompany Loans provide for repayments
of principal in amounts and at times sufficient to enable repayments in full or in part of principal under
the Fixed Rate Notes or Floating Rate Notes, as the case may be, whether at maturity, on early
redemption or upon acceleration. Both the Company and Sub Lecta S.A., each of which will be issuing
Intercompany Loans, are holding companies that have no operations and generate no revenues of their
own and have no independent assets other than their investments in their respective Subsidiaries. To the
extent such entities must make payments on the Intercompany Loans, they will be dependent on
dividends received from their subsidiaries, payments on intercompany loans or other distributions.

Each Intercompany Loan will be a general unsubordinated obligation of the Subsidiary borrowing
such loan and:

  - will rank pari passu in right of payment with all its existing and future Debt that is not
subordinated to such Intercompany Loan;

117


-----

  - will rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future subordinated obligations of such
Subsidiary; and

  - will be effectively subordinated to any existing and future Debt of such Subsidiary that is
secured with property and assets that do not secure such Intercompany Loan, to the extent of
the value of such assets.

**_Security_**

As noted above, on or immediately following the Issue Date, except as described above under
‘‘—Post-Closing Actions,’’ the Notes and the Guarantees will benefit from security granted directly in
favor of the Security Trustee (the ‘‘Collateral’’), as set forth in further detail in Annex A to this
Offering Memorandum.

No appraisals of the Collateral have been prepared by or on behalf of the Company in connection
with the issuance of the Notes. There can be no assurance that the proceeds from the sale of the
Collateral would be sufficient to satisfy the obligations owed to the Holders of the Notes. By its nature,
some or all of the Collateral will be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value.
Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the Collateral would be able to be sold in a short period of
time, if at all.

The Trustee and the creditors under the New Revolving Credit Facility have, and by accepting a
Note, each Holder will be deemed to have, irrevocably appointed Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch
as Security Trustee to act as its security trustee under the Intercreditor Agreement, the Notes, the
applicable Indenture (including the Guarantees) and the Security Documents (together, the ‘‘Finance
Documents’’). The Trustee and the creditors under the New Revolving Credit Facility have, and by
accepting a Note, each Holder will be deemed to have, irrevocably authorized the Security Trustee to
(i) perform the duties and exercise the rights, powers and discretions that are specifically given to it
under the Intercreditor Agreement or other Finance Documents, together with any other incidental
rights, power and discretions, and (ii) execute each Finance Document expressed to be executed by the
Security Trustee on its behalf. The security interests in the Collateral securing the Notes, which in
respect of enforcement of any Collateral will vote as a single class, will be first ranking except that the
New Revolving Credit Facility and certain hedging obligations will be repaid in priority upon
enforcement of the Collateral. See ‘‘Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement’’ for
a summary of the Intercreditor Agreement.

**_Release of Guarantees_**

Pursuant to the Indentures, the Capital Stock of a Guarantor may be sold, leased, transferred or
otherwise disposed of to another Person under the covenant described under ‘‘—Certain covenants—
Limitation on sales of assets and Restricted Subsidiary stock.’’

Upon any sale or disposition (including, without limitation, by way of merger, consolidation or
otherwise) of (i) Capital Stock of a Guarantor following which such Guarantor is no longer a
Restricted Subsidiary, (ii) all or substantially all of the properties and assets of such Guarantor to a
Person that is not (either before or after giving effect to such transaction) the Company or a Restricted
Subsidiary of the Company or (iii) all or substantially all of the properties and assets of such Guarantor
to another Guarantor in connection with a liquidation or dissolution of such Guarantor; provided that
such other Guarantor expressly assumes in writing in form satisfactory to the applicable Trustee in its
sole discretion all the obligations of such Guarantor under the applicable Indenture, as long as the sale
or disposition complies with the covenant described in ‘‘—Certain covenants—Limitation on sales of
assets and Restricted Subsidiary stock,’’ the Guarantee of any such Guarantor will be released;
_provided, however, that such release is in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement. See_
‘‘Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement.’’

The Guarantee provided by a Guarantor also will be released under the relevant Indenture:

(i) upon the valid designation of such Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary;

(ii) if the Company exercises its legal defeasance option or covenant defeasance option as
described under ‘‘—Defeasance’’ or if its obligations under the relevant Indenture are
discharged in accordance with the terms of the relevant Indenture, in each case in

118


-----

accordance with the terms and conditions in the relevant Indenture and the
Intercreditor Agreement;

(iii) upon repayment in full of the Notes;

(iv) upon a sale of all the Capital Stock of the applicable Guarantor (or any parent of such
Guarantor) pursuant to an Enforcement Action pursuant to the Intercreditor
Agreement;

(v) in the event that the continued obligations of such Guarantor or the continued
existence of such Guarantor could reasonably be expected to give rise to or result in
(now or in the future): (a) any violation of applicable law or (b) any personal liability
for the officers, directors or indirect shareholders of such Guarantor; which in each
case of (a) and (b) cannot be avoided or otherwise prevented through measures
reasonably available to the Company and the Guarantor; and

(vi) as described under ‘‘—Amendments and waivers.’’

Upon request and at the cost of the Company, or, as the case may be, the relevant Guarantor and
upon delivery by the Company to the Trustee of an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel to
the foregoing effect, the Trustee will execute any documents reasonably requested by the Company or
the relevant Guarantor, as the case may be, in writing in order to evidence the release, discharge and
termination in respect of any Guarantee to be released as described above.

**_Release of Collateral_**

The Collateral created by the Security Documents shall be released and the Security Trustee shall
disclaim and give up any and all rights it has in or to the Collateral, and any rights it has under the
Security Documents:

(i) if the Collateral is an asset of a Guarantor (or any of its Subsidiaries), upon
designation of the Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary;

(ii) if the Company exercises its legal defeasance option or covenant defeasance option as
described under ‘‘—Defeasance’’ or if its obligations under the relevant Indenture are
discharged in accordance with the terms of the relevant Indenture, in each case in
accordance with the terms and conditions in the relevant Indenture and the
Intercreditor Agreement;

(iii) upon repayment in full of the Notes;

(iv) upon the surrender of all outstanding Notes issued under the relevant Indenture to the
Trustee for cancellation;

(v) upon foreclosure on Collateral pursuant to an Enforcement Action pursuant to any
Security Document or the Intercreditor Agreement;

(vi) upon the release of the Collateral in accordance with the paragraph below;

(vii) in the event that the continued obligations under the Liens on the Collateral could
reasonably be expected to give rise to or result in (now or in the future): (a) any
violation of applicable law or (b) any personal liability for the officers, directors or
indirect shareholders of the pledgor of the Collateral; which in each case of (a) and
(b) cannot be avoided or otherwise prevented through measures reasonably available to
the Company and the pledgor;

(viii) as described under ‘‘—Amendments and waivers;’’

(ix) as described under ‘‘—Certain covenants—Limitation on Liens;’’

(x) as described under ‘‘—Certain covenants—Impairment of security interests;’’ or

(xi) upon any other valid release of the Collateral as security for obligations of the
Company or a Guarantor under the relevant Indenture;

_provided such release is permitted by or does not violate the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement._

119


-----

Upon request of the Company or any Guarantor, in connection with any sale, lease, sale and
leaseback, assignment, conveyance, transfer or other disposition of assets or property permitted by or
not prohibited by the relevant Indenture (including, without limitation, the covenants described in
‘‘—Certain covenants—Limitation on sales of assets and Restricted Subsidiary stock’’ and ‘‘—Certain
covenants—Consolidation, merger and sale of assets’’), the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security
Documents, the Security Trustee shall (without notice to, or vote or consent of, any Holder) take such
actions as shall be reasonably required to release its security interest in any Collateral being disposed in
such disposition, to the extent necessary to permit consummation of such disposition in accordance with
the relevant Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents, and the Security
Trustee shall receive full payment therefor from the Company for any costs incurred thereby. In all
cases of a disposition involving a release of Collateral, the Company shall deliver to the Security
Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel certifying compliance with the requirements
of release under the relevant Indenture. At the reasonable request of the Company, the Security
Trustee shall execute and deliver an appropriate instrument evidencing such release (in the form
provided by the Company and agreed by the Security Trustee).

Any release of Collateral made in compliance with the provisions set forth in ‘‘—Release of
Collateral’’ shall not be deemed to impair the Lien under the Security Documents or the Collateral
thereunder in contravention of the covenant described in ‘‘—Certain covenants—Limitation on Liens.’’

**Change of Control**

If a Change of Control occurs, subject to the terms hereof, each Holder will have the right to
require the Company to repurchase all or part (equal to A100,000 aggregate principal amount and
integral multiples of A1,000 in excess thereof) of such Holder’s Notes at a purchase price equal to
101% of the principal amount thereof, plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the Change of
Control Purchase Date (such price, together with such interest, the ‘‘Change of Control Purchase
Price’’), which date (the ‘‘Change of Control Purchase Date’’) shall be no earlier than 30 days nor later
than 60 days from the date such notice of the Change of Control (the ‘‘Change of Control Offer’’) is
mailed, or such later date as may be required by law or any applicable requirements of any securities
exchange on which such Notes are listed. No later than 30 days after the occurrence of such Change of
Control, or, at the Company’s option, at any time prior to the occurrence of such Change of Control
following the public announcement thereof or if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of
Control, notify each Holder of the Notes in accordance with the provisions set forth under ‘‘—Notices,’’
with a copy of such notice to the Trustee in writing, of the occurrence of the Change of Control. On
the Change of Control Purchase Date, the Company will (if the Change of Control occurred) purchase
all Notes properly tendered in the Change of Control Offer and not withdrawn in accordance with the
procedures set forth in such notice. The Change of Control Offer will state, among other things, the
procedures that Holders of the Notes must follow to accept the Change of Control Offer.

The Indentures and the New Revolving Credit Facility will have similar provisions requiring the
Company and/or borrowers under such instruments to offer to repay such instruments. No assurance
can be given that the Company will have sufficient liquidity to comply with such provisions and to
make the Change of Control Offers required by the Indentures.

The Company will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of
Control if (1) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and
otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indentures applicable to a Change of
Control Offer made by the Company and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn
under such Change of Control Offer; (2) unconditional notice of redemption has been given pursuant
to the Indentures as described under ‘‘—Optional redemption’’ or all conditions to such redemption
have been satisfied or waived; or (3) notice of redemption has been given pursuant to the Indentures
as described under ‘‘—Redemption for changes in taxes,’’ in each case unless and until there is a
default in payment of the applicable Redemption Price.

The occurrence of certain of the events which would constitute a Change of Control would require
mandatory prepayment of Debt outstanding under the New Revolving Credit Facility and might
constitute a default under, or require prepayment of, future Debt of the Company or its Subsidiaries.
The occurrence of a Change of Control would also trigger an obligation of the Company to repurchase
the Notes, which may in turn lead to a default under the Notes if the Company cannot finance such a
repurchase. In addition, the exercise by the Holders of the Notes of their right to require the Company

120


-----

to repurchase the Notes could cause a default under the Debt of the Company or its Subsidiaries, even
if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the
Company. Finally, if a Change of Control Offer is made, there can be no assurance that the Company
will have sufficient funds or other resources to pay the Change of Control Purchase Price for all the
Notes that might be delivered by Holders thereof seeking to accept the Change of Control Offer. See
‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and Our Structure—We may not have the ability to raise
the funds necessary to finance a change of control offer and certain events which might otherwise
constitute a change of control may not trigger a requirement for us to repurchase the Notes if our
Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio is above a certain threshold in connection with the occurrence of a
Change of Control event’’ and ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and Our Structure—Our
substantial indebtedness may make it difficult for us to service our debt, including the Notes, and to
operate our business.’’

The Change of Control provisions described above may deter certain mergers, tender offers and
other takeover attempts involving the Company and, thus, the removal of incumbent management. One
of the events that constitutes a Change of Control under the Indentures is a sale, conveyance, transfer
or lease of all or substantially all the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. The
phrase ‘‘all or substantially all’’ is subject to judicial interpretation depending on the facts and
circumstances of the subject transaction. The Indentures will be governed by New York law, and there
is no established quantitative definition under New York law of ‘‘substantially all’’ the assets of a
corporation. Accordingly, in certain circumstances it may be unclear whether a Change of Control has
occurred and whether the Company may therefore be required to make a Change of Control Offer.

If at the time of such Change of Control, the Notes are listed on the Official List of the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted for trading on the Euro MTF Market of the Luxembourg
Stock Exchange, to the extent required by the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, the Company
will notify the Luxembourg Stock Exchange that a Change of Control has occurred and any relevant
details relating to such Change of Control.

The Company will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the
U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the ‘‘U.S. Exchange Act’’), and any other securities
laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to any Change of Control
Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions
relating to the Change of Control Offer, the Company will comply with applicable securities laws and
regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control
covenant by virtue thereof.

**Certain covenants**

The Indentures will contain, among others, the following covenants:

**_Limitation on Debt_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly,
Incur any Debt (including Acquired Debt) other than Permitted Debt; provided, however, that the
Company may, and may permit any Guarantor to, Incur Debt if no Default or Event of Default shall
have occurred and be continuing at the time of such Incurrence or would occur as a consequence of
such Incurrence and, after giving Pro forma effect to such Incurrence, (i) the Consolidated Coverage
Ratio as of the date of the Incurrence of such Debt would exceed 2.50 to 1.00; and (ii) to the extent
that the Debt is Senior Secured Debt, the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio as of the
date of the Incurrence of such Debt would not exceed 4.00 to 1.00.

Permitted Debt is defined as follows:

(i) Debt (a) of the Company evidenced by the Notes issued on the Issue Date (not
including Additional Notes), (b) of the Guarantors in respect of the Guarantees,
including any Additional Guarantees, and (c) any ‘‘parallel debt’’ obligations created
under the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Documents or the Indentures in
respect of clauses (a) and (b);

(ii) Debt of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary (x) Incurred under Credit Facilities
(including, without double counting, any Debt to the extent backed by letters of credit,
guarantees or bonds issued under Credit Facilities), and (y) any Refinancing Debt and

121


-----

any ‘‘parallel debt’’ obligations created under the Intercreditor Agreement or the
Security Documents Incurred in respect of Debt under (x); provided, that the aggregate
principal amount of all such Debt under Credit Facilities and Refinancing Debt in
respect thereof under this clause (ii) at any one time outstanding does not exceed
A80 million, which amount shall be permanently reduced by any payments made by the
Company under a Credit Facility with the Net Available Cash from any Asset
Disposition (which are accompanied by a corresponding permanent commitment
reduction) pursuant to clause (iii) of the first paragraph of the covenant described
under ‘‘—Limitation on sales of assets and Restricted Subsidiary stock.’’

(iii) Debt of the Company owing to and held by any Restricted Subsidiary and Debt of any
Restricted Subsidiary owing to and held by the Company or any wholly-owned
Restricted Subsidiary; provided, however, that if such Debt is owed by the Company or
a Guarantor (other than an Intercompany Loan), then it shall be expressly
subordinated to the prior payment in full in cash of all obligations with respect to the
Notes; and provided, further, that any subsequent transfer of any such Debt (except to
the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary), shall be deemed, in each case, to constitute
the Incurrence of such Debt by the issuer thereof;

(iv) Debt (other than Debt permitted by the immediately preceding paragraph or elsewhere
in this paragraph) in an aggregate principal amount outstanding at any time not to
exceed A115 million;

(v) the incurrence by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of Debt
represented by Capitalized Lease Obligations, mortgage financings or purchase money
obligations, in each case, incurred for the purpose of financing or refinancing all or any
part of the purchase price or cost of construction or improvement of property, plant or
equipment used in the business of the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, or in
respect of a Sale/Leaseback Transaction, in an aggregate principal amount, not to
exceed A5 million at any time outstanding;

(vi) Debt Incurred pursuant to any Qualified Receivables Financing that is not recourse to
the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries except for such recourse as arises
through Standard Securitization Undertakings;

(vii) Debt under Hedging Obligations that are incurred in the ordinary course of business,
not for speculative purposes and (1) for the purpose of fixing or hedging interest rate
risk with respect to any Debt Incurred without violation of the Indentures; (2) for the
purpose of fixing or hedging currency exchange rate risk with respect to any currency;
or (3) for the purpose of fixing or hedging commodity price risk with respect to any
commodities;

(viii) Debt in connection with one or more standby letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or
performance, bid, surety, judgment, appeal or similar bonds or completion guarantees
provided by the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary and issued in the ordinary course
of business or pursuant to self-insurance obligations and not in connection with the
borrowing of money or the obtaining of advances of credit;

(ix) Debt arising from the honoring by a bank or other financial institution of a check,
draft or similar instrument drawn against insufficient funds, overdrafts or cash pooling
arrangements in the ordinary course of business; provided, however, that any such Debt
that arises is extinguished within six Business Days of Incurrence;

(x) Debt of the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries represented by letters of
credit for the account of the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may
be, in order to provide security for workers’ compensation claims, payment obligations
in connection with self-insurance or similar requirements in the ordinary course of
business;

(xi) Debt arising from agreements of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary providing for
indemnification, adjustment of purchase price, earn out or similar obligations, in each
case, Incurred in connection with the disposition of any business, assets or Subsidiary,
other than guarantees of Debt Incurred by any Person acquiring all or any portion of

122


-----

such business, assets or Subsidiary for the purpose of financing such acquisition;
_provided that the maximum aggregate liability in respect of all such Debt shall at no_
time exceed the gross proceeds actually received by the Company and the Restricted
Subsidiary in connection with such disposition;

(xii) guarantees by the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary of Debt Incurred by the
Company or a Restricted Subsidiary so long as the Incurrence of such Debt by the
Company or any such Restricted Subsidiary is otherwise permitted by the terms of the
Indentures;

(xiii) guarantees by the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary of Debt Incurred by Joint
Ventures that does not exceed A5 million in the aggregate at any one time outstanding;

(xiv) Debt of a Person existing at the time that Person becomes a Restricted Subsidiary or
assumed in connection with the acquisition of assets by the Company or a Restricted
Subsidiary and not Incurred in connection with or in anticipation of, such Person
becoming a Restricted Subsidiary; provided that the holders of any such Debt do not,
at any time, have direct or indirect recourse to any property or assets of the Company
or any Restricted Subsidiary other than the property or assets of such acquired Person;
_provided, further, that on the date of such acquisition and after giving Pro forma effect_
thereto, either (1) the Company would have been able to Incur at least A1.00 of
additional Debt pursuant to the immediately preceding paragraph or (2) the
Consolidated Coverage Ratio would be greater than or equal to the Consolidated
Coverage Ratio immediately prior to giving Pro forma effect to such acquisition;

(xv) Debt of the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries Incurred pursuant to an
obligation imposed by law to transfer employee benefit obligation to a third party;

(xvi) Debt of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary not otherwise described in
clauses (i) through (xv) above (1) outstanding on the Issue Date and disclosed in the
Offering Memorandum Pro forma for the issuance of the Notes and the use of
proceeds therefrom and (2) any Refinancing Debt Incurred in respect thereof; and

(xvii) Refinancing Debt Incurred in respect of Debt Incurred under the first paragraph of
this covenant or under clause (i) or (xiv) hereof,

_provided, however, that, for purposes of determining the compliance of any non-euro-denominated Debt_
Incurred under clauses (ii), (iv), (v), (xiii) or (xiv) above with the euro-denominated restriction
contained therein, the euro-equivalent principal amount of such Debt Incurred pursuant thereto will be
calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Debt was Incurred,
in the case of term Debt, or first committed, in the case of revolving credit Debt; provided, that (i) the
euro-equivalent principal amount of any such Debt outstanding on the Issue Date under clause (ii)
above (other than term Debt) will be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect
on the date thereof and (ii) (A) any Refinancing Debt Incurred to refinance non-euro-denominated
Debt previously Incurred which would cause the euro-denominated restriction under such clause to be
exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing
(the ‘‘Initial Refinancing Rate’’) will be deemed not to exceed such euro-denominated restriction under
such clause so long as the principal amount of such Refinancing Debt does not exceed the principal
amount of the Debt being refinanced, and (B) all subsequent Incurrences of Refinancing Debt subject
to the euro-denominated restriction under such clause will be determined as if the relevant currency
exchange rate applied to any subsequent Refinancing Debt was the Initial Refinancing Rate; provided,
_however, that the principal amount of any such subsequent Refinancing Debt, if Incurred in a currency_
other than the currency of the Debt being refinanced, will be calculated based on the currency
exchange rate applicable to the currency or currencies in which such proposed Refinancing Debt is
denominated on the date of such refinancing.

For purposes of determining any particular amount of Debt under this ‘‘—Limitation on Debt’’
covenant, accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the obligation to pay
commitment fees and the payment of interest in the form of additional Debt shall not be treated as
Debt. In addition, for purposes of determining compliance with this ‘‘—Limitation on Debt’’ covenant,
in the event that an item of proposed Debt meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of
Permitted Debt described in clauses (i) through (xvii) above, or is entitled to be Incurred pursuant to
the first paragraph of this covenant, the Company shall be permitted to classify such item of Debt on

123


-----

the date of its Incurrence and, except with respect to Debt Incurred under clause (ii) above, reclassify
such item of Debt, in each case in any manner that complies with this covenant.

**_Limitation on Restricted Payments_**

The Company will not make, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to make, directly or
indirectly, any Restricted Payment if at the time of, and after giving effect to, such proposed Restricted
Payment,

(a) a Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing,

(b) the Company could not Incur at least A1.00 of additional Debt pursuant to clause (i) of
first paragraph of the covenant described under ‘‘—Limitation on Debt,’’ or

(c) the aggregate amount of such Restricted Payment and all other Restricted Payments
declared or made since the Issue Date (the amount of any Restricted Payment, if made
other than in cash, to be based upon Fair Market Value) would exceed an amount
equal to the sum of:

(i) 50% of the aggregate Consolidated Net Income accrued during the period
(treated as one accounting period) from the Issue Date, to the end of the
Company’s most recent fiscal quarter ending prior to the date of such

minus 100% of such deficit),

(ii) Capital Stock Sale Proceeds and (without duplication of any amounts included
in Capital Stock Sale Proceeds) Capital Stock Contributions, and

(iii) the amount by which Debt of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary is
reduced on the Company’s balance sheet upon the conversion or exchange

Company or any Restricted Subsidiary convertible or exchangeable for Capital
Stock (other than Disqualified Stock) of the Company (less the amount of any
cash or other property distributed by the Company or any Restricted
Subsidiary upon such conversion or exchange);

_provided, that upon a Change of Control, all amounts calculated pursuant to this clause (c) shall be_
reset to zero and all references to the Issue Date (including references in the definitions of terms used
herein) in this clause (c) shall thereafter refer to the date on which such Change of Control occurred.

Notwithstanding the foregoing limitation, the Company and any Restricted Subsidiary may:

(a) pay dividends on its Capital Stock within 60 days of the declaration thereof if, on said
declaration date, such dividends could have been paid in compliance with the
Indentures; provided, however, that such dividend shall be included in the calculation of
the amount of Restricted Payments;

(b) redeem, repurchase, defease, acquire or retire for value, any Subordinated Obligation
with the proceeds of any Refinancing Debt in respect of such Subordinated Obligation;
_provided, however, that such redemption, repurchase, defeasance or other acquisition or_

Payments;

(c) make any Restricted Payment by exchange for, or out of the proceeds of the
substantially concurrent sale of, Capital Stock of the Company (other than Disqualified
Stock and other than Capital Stock issued or sold to a Subsidiary of the Company or
an employee stock ownership plan or to a trust established by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries for the benefit of their employees) or Capital Stock Contributions;
_provided, however, that (i) such Restricted Payment shall be excluded in the calculation_
of the amount of Restricted Payments and (ii) the Net Cash Proceeds from such sale
or contribution shall, to the extent so used to acquire, redeem or retire Capital Stock
of the Company or Subordinated Obligations of the Company, be excluded from the
calculation of the amount of Capital Stock Sale Proceeds and Capital Stock
Contributions;

connection with or in contemplation of a merger, consolidation or transfer of assets
that complies with the covenant described under ‘‘—Consolidation, merger and sale of
assets;’’

(f) make payments of dividends on Disqualified Stock issued in accordance with the
covenant described under ‘‘—Limitation on Debt;’’

(g) so long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing or would be
caused thereby, following a Public Equity Offering that results in a Public Market of
the Capital Stock of the Company or any Holding Company thereof, make payments of
dividends on the Capital Stock of the Company up to 6% per annum of the Net Cash
Proceeds received by the Company in any such Public Equity Offering or any
subsequent Public Equity Offering of such Capital Stock, or the Net Cash Proceeds of
any such Public Equity Offering or subsequent Public Equity Offering of such Capital
Stock of any Holding Company of the Company that are contributed in cash to the
Company’s equity (other than through the issuance of Disqualified Stock); provided
that if such Public Equity Offering was of Capital Stock of a Holding Company of the
Company, the net proceeds of any such dividend are used to fund a corresponding
dividend in equal or greater amount on the Capital Stock of such Holding Company;
and

(h) make additional Restricted Payments in an aggregate amount not to exceed A50 million
since the Issue Date.

**_Transactions with Affiliates_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly,
enter into any transaction or series of related transactions (including the purchase, sale, transfer,
assignment, lease, conveyance or exchange of any property or the rendering of any service) with, or for
the benefit of, any Affiliate of the Company (an ‘‘Affiliate Transaction’’) involving aggregate payments
or consideration in excess of A2 million, unless (a) the terms of such Affiliate Transaction are no less
favorable to the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that could be
obtained in a comparable arm’s length transaction with a Person that is not an Affiliate of the
Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, (b) with respect to an Affiliate Transaction involving aggregate
payments or value in excess of A5 million, the terms of such Affiliate Transaction are set forth in
writing and the Board of Directors (including a majority of the disinterested members of the Board of
Directors) approves such Affiliate Transaction and, in its good faith judgment, believes that such
Affiliate Transaction complies with clause (a) of this paragraph and (c) with respect to an Affiliate
Transaction involving aggregate payments or value in excess of A20 million, the terms of such Affiliate
Transaction are set forth in writing and the Company obtains a written opinion from an Independent
Appraiser to the effect that such Affiliate Transaction is fair, from a financial point of view, to the
Company or is not less favorable to the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary than could have been
obtained in a comparable arms’ length transaction with a Person that is not an Affiliate of the
Company or a Restricted Subsidiary.

The foregoing covenant will not prohibit:

(A) Permitted Investments and any Restricted Payment permitted to be paid as described
above under ‘‘—Limitation on Restricted Payments;’’

(B) any issuance of securities, or other payments, awards or grants in cash, securities or
otherwise pursuant to, or the funding of or other transactions pursuant to, employment
arrangements, stock options and stock ownership plans approved by the Board of
Directors of the Company;

(C) loans or advances to employees of the Company in the ordinary course of business;

(D) the payment of reasonable fees, compensation and employee benefit arrangements,

125


-----

(E) any transaction between the Company and a Restricted Subsidiary or between
Restricted Subsidiaries;

(F) the performance of any agreement as in effect on the Issue Date which is disclosed to
Holders of the Notes in the Offering Memorandum under the heading ‘‘Certain
Relationships and Related Party Transactions’’ or any amendment or renewal thereto
or any transaction contemplated thereby or in any replacement agreement thereto so
long as any such amendment or renewal or replacement agreement is not more
disadvantageous to the Holders of Notes (as determined by the Board of Directors of
the Company in their reasonable and good faith judgment) in any material respect
than the original agreement;

(G) transactions between or among any of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries and any
Person in connection with a Qualified Receivables Financing, in each case provided
that such transactions are not otherwise prohibited by the Indentures;

(H) transactions between the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries and any Person
that is an Affiliate solely as a result of the ownership by the Company or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries of Capital Stock of such Person;

(I) transactions with customers, clients, suppliers or purchasers or sellers of goods or
services, in each case in the ordinary course of business and otherwise in compliance
with the terms of the Indentures which are fair to the Company or its Restricted
Subsidiaries, or are on terms at least as favorable as might reasonably have been
obtained at such time from an unaffiliated party, in each case in the reasonable
determination of the Board of Directors of the Company or the senior management
thereof;

(J) payments of any Management Fees; or

(K) any issuance of Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock) of the Company to a
Permitted Holder or an Affiliate.

**_Limitation on Liens_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, Incur Secured Debt of
any kind, except:

(a) in the case of any property or asset that does not constitute Collateral, (1) Permitted Liens
or (2) Liens on property or assets that are not Permitted Liens if contemporaneously therewith,
effective provision is also made that: (1) in the case of Secured Debt that is expressly subordinate or
junior in right of payment to the Notes or a Guarantee, the Notes or such Guarantee, as the case may
be, are secured prior to such Secured Debt for so long as such Secured Debt is secured by a Lien; and
(2) in all other cases, the Notes or the Guarantee of such Guarantor, as the case may be, are secured
equally and ratably to such Secured Debt for so long as such Secured Debt is secured by a Lien; and

(b) in the case of any property or asset that constitutes Collateral, Permitted Collateral Liens.

Any such Lien arising as a result of clauses (a)(1) or (a)(2) above will be automatically and
unconditionally released and discharged concurrently with (i) the unconditional release of the Lien
which gave rise to such Lien (other than as a consequence of an enforcement action with respect to the
assets subject to such Lien) or (ii) as set forth under the heading ‘‘—Release of Collateral.’’

**_Limitation on guarantees of Debt by Restricted Subsidiaries_**

The Company shall ensure that, within 60 days after the audited financial statements of the
Company become available for each financial year of the Company beginning with the financial year
ended December 31, 2016, any Restricted Subsidiary that after the Issue Date is or becomes a Material
Subsidiary (except for any Restricted Subsidiary which was a Material Subsidiary at the Issue Date but
was not an initial Guarantor, any Restricted Subsidiary that is already a Guarantor, or any Restricted
Subsidiary as to which the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries do not own, directly or indirectly,
greater than 90% of the Capital Stock) will execute and deliver supplemental indentures providing for
the Guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary on the same terms as the Guarantees granted by the other
Guarantors hereunder.

126


-----

The Company will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor, directly or
indirectly, to guarantee, assume or in any other manner become liable for the payment of any Debt of
the Company or a Guarantor under any Debt unless:

(1) (A) such Restricted Subsidiary simultaneously executes and delivers supplemental
indentures providing for Guarantees of payment of the Notes by such Restricted
Subsidiary on the same terms as the guarantee of such Debt; and

(B) with respect to any guarantee of Subordinated Obligations by such Restricted
Subsidiary, any such guarantee will be subordinated to such Restricted
Subsidiary’s Guarantee at least to the same extent as such Subordinated
Obligations are subordinated to the Notes; and

(2) such Restricted Subsidiary waives and will not in any manner whatsoever claim or take
the benefit or advantage of, any rights of reimbursement, indemnity or subrogation or
any other rights against the Company or any other Restricted Subsidiary as a result of
any payment by such Restricted Subsidiary under its Guarantee.

Notwithstanding the foregoing two paragraphs, the Company shall not be obligated to cause any
such Restricted Subsidiary to guarantee the Notes to the extent that such Guarantee would reasonably
be expected to give rise to or result in (i) any violation of applicable law, rule, regulation or order that
cannot be avoided or otherwise prevented through measures reasonably available to the Company or
such Restricted Subsidiary or (ii) any liability for the officers, directors or shareholders of such
Restricted Subsidiary.

In addition, notwithstanding the foregoing and the other provisions of the Indentures, any
Guarantee issued pursuant to this covenant by a Restricted Subsidiary shall provide by its terms that it
shall be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged in the circumstances described
under ‘‘—Credit enhancement—Release of Guarantees.’’

**_Limitation on restrictions on distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly,
create or otherwise cause or permit to exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or
restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to (a) pay dividends or make any other
distributions on its Capital Stock, (b) make any loans or advances to the Company or any other
Restricted Subsidiary or (c) transfer any of its property or assets to the Company or any other
Restricted Subsidiary, except:

(i) any encumbrance or restriction which is in effect at or entered into on the Issue Date,
including, without limitation, pursuant to the New Revolving Credit Facility, and which
is disclosed in the Offering Memorandum under the heading ‘‘Description of Other
Indebtedness;’’

(ii) any encumbrance or restriction with respect to a Restricted Subsidiary or property or
assets pursuant to an agreement on or prior to the date on which such Restricted
Subsidiary or property or assets was acquired by the Company or a Restricted
Subsidiary (other than Debt Incurred as consideration in, or to provide all or any
portion of the funds or credit support utilized to consummate, the transaction or series
of related transactions pursuant to which such Restricted Subsidiary became a
Restricted Subsidiary or was acquired by the Company or Restricted Subsidiary or the
property or assets were acquired by the Company or Restricted Subsidiary) and
outstanding on such date;

(iii) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement effecting an amendment,
modification, restatement, renewal, increase, supplement, refund, replacement or
refinancing of an agreement referred to in clauses (i) or (ii) of this covenant or this
clause (iii); provided, however, that the encumbrances and restrictions contained in any
such agreement or amendment, taken as a whole, are no less favorable to the Holders
of the Notes than encumbrances and restrictions contained in such predecessor
agreements;

(iv) any encumbrance or restriction (A) consisting of customary provisions restricting
subletting or assignment of leases and customary provisions in other agreements that

127


-----

restrict assignment of such agreements or rights thereunder or customary restrictions
contained in asset sale agreements limiting the transfer of such property pending the
closing of such sale, (B) arising by virtue of any transfer of, agreement to transfer,
option or right with respect to, or Lien on, any property or assets of the Company or
any Restricted Subsidiary not otherwise prohibited by the terms of the Indentures or
(C) arising or agreed to in the ordinary course of business and that does not,
individually or in the aggregate, detract from the value of property or assets of the
Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in any manner material to
the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole;

(v) in the case of clause (c) above, restrictions contained in Capitalized Lease Obligations,
security agreements or mortgages securing Debt of a Restricted Subsidiary to the
extent such restrictions restrict the transfer of the property subject to such Capitalized
Lease Obligations, security agreements or mortgages;

(vi) any restriction with respect to a Restricted Subsidiary imposed pursuant to an
agreement entered into for the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the Capital
Stock or assets of such Restricted Subsidiary pending the closing of such sale or
disposition;

(vii) any encumbrance or restriction with respect to a Restricted Subsidiary imposed
pursuant to a Permitted Joint Venture Transaction;

(viii) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement related to Debt in respect of
any Qualified Receivables Financing which is permitted under clause (vi) of the second
paragraph of the covenant described under ‘‘—Limitation on Debt;’’

(ix) any encumbrance or restriction imposed pursuant to any Interest Rate Protection
Agreement, Currency Exchange Protection Agreement or Commodity Agreement;

(x) any encumbrance or restriction imposed by applicable law, rules, regulations and/or
orders;

(xi) any encumbrances or restrictions on cash or other deposits or net worth imposed by
customers under contracts entered into in the ordinary course of business; and

(xii) any encumbrances or restrictions Incurred in accordance with the covenant described
under ‘‘—Limitation on Liens.’’

**_Limitation on sales of assets and Restricted Subsidiary stock_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, make any Asset
Disposition unless:

(i) the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, receives consideration
at the time of such Asset Disposition at least equal to the Fair Market Value of the
assets subject to such Asset Disposition;

(ii) at least 75% of such consideration consists of cash or Cash Equivalents, and is received
at the time of the Asset Disposition (which shall be deemed to include other
consideration converted to cash or Cash Equivalents within 180 days of such Asset
Disposition); and

(iii) an amount equal to 100% of the Net Available Cash from such Asset Disposition is
applied by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be:

(A) _first, to the extent the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary elects, to make_
an investment in, or expenditures for, properties and assets (including by
means of an investment in Additional Assets by a Restricted Subsidiary with
Net Available Cash received by the Company or another Restricted Subsidiary)
within twelve months from the later of such Asset Disposition or the receipt of
such Net Available Cash or pursuant to arrangements in place within the
twelve-month period (to the extent such arrangements are completed within
180 days after execution of such arrangement);

128


-----

(B) _second, to the extent of the balance of such Net Available Cash after_
application in accordance with clause (A), to the extent the Company or such
Restricted Subsidiary elects (or is required by the terms of Debt), to prepay,
repay or purchase Senior Debt of the Company or any Guarantor or Debt of a
Subsidiary of the Company that is not a Guarantor (in each case other than
Debt owed to the Company or an Affiliate of the Company) within twelvemonths from the later of the date of such Asset Disposition or the receipt of
such Net Available Cash;

(C) _third, to the extent of the balance of such Net Available Cash after application_
in accordance with clauses (A) and (B), to the extent the Company elects, to
purchase Notes;

(D) _fourth, to the extent of the balance of such Net Available Cash after_
application in accordance with clauses (A), (B) and (C), to make a
Prepayment Offer (as defined below) to purchase Notes pursuant to and
subject to the conditions described below; and

(E) _fifth, to the extent of the balance of such Net Available Cash after application_
in accordance with clauses (A), (B), (C), or (D), for any purpose permitted by
the Indentures,

_provided, however, that, in connection with any prepayment, repayment or purchase of Debt pursuant to_
clause (B), (C) or (D), the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary will retire such Debt and will cause
the related loan commitment (if any) to be permanently reduced in an amount equal to the principal
amount so prepaid, repaid or purchased.

Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries will not be
required to apply any Net Available Cash in accordance with such foregoing provisions to the extent
that such Net Available Cash does not exceed A10 million during any fiscal year, except to the extent
that the aggregate Net Available Cash from all Asset Dispositions which are not applied in accordance
with the foregoing provisions exceeds A20 million. Pending application of Net Available Cash pursuant
to this provision, such Net Available Cash may be used to temporarily reduce revolving credit
borrowings or otherwise invested in any manner that is not prohibited by the terms of the Indentures.

In the event of any Asset Disposition that requires the purchase of Notes pursuant to clause (D),
the Company will be required to purchase Notes tendered pursuant to any offer by the Company for
Notes (the ‘‘Prepayment Offer’’) at a purchase price of 100% of their principal amount plus accrued
interest (if any) to the Purchase Date (as defined below) in accordance with the procedures (including
prorating the Fixed Rate Notes and Floating Rate Notes in the event of oversubscription on the basis
of the aggregate amount of each series of Notes tendered) set forth in the Indentures. The Company
will not be required to make a Prepayment Offer for Notes if the Net Available Cash available therefor
(after application of the proceeds as provided in clauses (A), (B) and (C)) is less than A10 million for
any particular Asset Disposition (which lesser amounts will be carried forward for purposes of
determining whether a Prepayment Offer is required with respect to the Net Available Cash from any
subsequent Asset Disposition).

Promptly, and in any event within ten days after the Company becomes obligated to make a
Prepayment Offer, the Company will deliver to the Trustee and to each Holder of Notes in accordance
with the provisions set forth under ‘‘—Notices’’ a written notice stating that such Holder may elect to
have its Notes purchased by the Company, either in whole or in part (subject to prorating in the event
the Prepayment Offer is oversubscribed) and in principal amounts of A100,000 and integral multiples of
A1,000 above A100,000 at the applicable purchase price. The notice will specify a purchase date not less
than 30 days nor more than 60 days after the date of such notice (the ‘‘Purchase Date’’) and will
contain information concerning the business of the Company which the Company in good faith believes
will enable Holders of Notes to make an informed decision and will contain all instructions and
material necessary to tender Notes pursuant to the Prepayment Offer and the procedures for
withdrawing such a tender (such procedures as set forth in the Indentures). After consummation of any
Prepayment Offer, Net Available Cash shall be reset to zero.

The Company will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the
U.S. Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of
Notes as described above. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict

129


-----

with provisions relating to the Prepayment Offer, the Company will comply with the applicable
securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations described above
by virtue thereof.

For the purposes of this covenant, the following will be deemed to be cash: (1) the assumption by
the transferee of Debt (other than Subordinated Obligations) of the Company or any Restricted
Subsidiary and the release of the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary from all liability on such Debt
in connection with such Asset Disposition (in which case the Company shall, without further action, be
deemed to have applied such assumed Debt in accordance with clause (iii) of the first paragraph of this
covenant); and (2) (a) Capital Stock of a Person conducting a Related Business that as a result of such
acquisition becomes a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company and (b) any other property or assets
(other than Debt and Capital Stock) that are used or useful in a Related Business.

**_Monitoring by the Trustee_**

The Trustee shall have no responsibility for monitoring any of the covenants described in this
section ‘‘—Certain covenants’’ and shall be entitled to assume, unless it receives written notice to the
contrary, that the Company and any Restricted Subsidiaries are all complying with their covenant
obligations described herein. The Company shall, pursuant to the Indentures, provide to the Trustee a
certificate of compliance on an annual basis certifying compliance (or not, as applicable) with such
covenants, and the Trustee will be entitled to rely on such certificates absolutely and without further
enquiry.

**_Reports to Holders_**

For so long as any Notes are outstanding, the Company will provide to the Trustee the following
reports:

(a) within 120 days after the end of the Company’s fiscal year, annual reports, in a level of
detail that is comparable in all material respects to that included in the Offering
Memorandum (with appropriate revisions, as reasonably determined by the Company,
to reflect changes in segment reporting, and except that the Company shall not be
required to commission expert reports as part of any description of the industry),
containing, to the extent applicable, the following information: (i) audited consolidated
balance sheets of the Company as of the end of the two most recent fiscal years and
audited consolidated income statements and statements of cash flow of the Company
for the two most recent fiscal years, including complete footnotes to such financial
statements and the report of the independent auditors on the financial statements;
(ii) Pro forma income statement and balance sheet information of the Company, which
need not comply with Article 11 of Regulation S-X under the U.S. Exchange Act
(‘‘Regulation S-X’’), together with explanatory footnotes, for any material acquisitions,
dispositions or recapitalizations that have occurred since the beginning of the most
recently completed fiscal year unless Pro forma information has been provided in a
previous report pursuant to clause (b) below (and provided that, with respect to an
acquisition, disposition or recapitalization that has occurred less than 75 calendar days
prior to the date such report is to be provided, such Pro forma information for such
acquisition, disposition or recapitalization shall be included in the report for the next
fiscal quarter); (iii) an operating and financial review of the audited financial
statements, including a discussion of the results of operations, financial condition, and
liquidity and capital resources of the Company, and a discussion of material
commitments and contingencies and critical accounting policies; (iv) a description of
the business, management and shareholders of the Company, all material affiliate
transactions and a description of all material contractual arrangements, including
material debt instruments; (v) a description of material risk factors and material recent
developments; (vi) earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization;
(vii) capital expenditures; (viii) depreciation and amortization; and (ix) operating profit
(loss) in IFRS;

(b) within 60 days following the end of the first three fiscal quarters in each fiscal year of
the Company, quarterly financial statements of the Company containing the following
information: (i) an unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet as of the end of

130


-----

such quarter and unaudited condensed statements of income and cash flow for the
most recent quarter and year-to-date periods ending on the unaudited condensed
balance sheet date, and the comparable prior year period, together with condensed
footnote disclosure; (ii) Pro forma income statement and balance sheet information of
the Company (which need not comply with Article 11 of Regulation S-X), together
with explanatory footnotes, for any material acquisitions, dispositions or
recapitalizations that have occurred since the beginning of the most recently completed
fiscal year unless Pro forma information has been provided in a previous report
pursuant to clause (a) or (c) (and provided that, with respect to an acquisition,
disposition or recapitalization that has occurred less than 75 calendar days prior to the
date such report is to be provided, such Pro forma information for such acquisition,
disposition or recapitalization shall be included in the report for the next fiscal quarter
or the current fiscal year, whichever occurs first); (iii) an operating and financial review
of the unaudited financial statements, including a discussion of the results of
operations, financial condition, and liquidity and capital resources of the Company, and
a discussion of material commitments and contingencies and critical accounting
policies; and (iv) material recent developments and any material changes to the risk
factors disclosed in the most recent annual report; and

(c) promptly after the occurrence of any material acquisition, disposition or restructuring
of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or any senior
executive officer changes at the Company or change in auditors of the Company or any
other material event that the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries announces
publicly, a report containing a description of such event.

At any time that any of the Company’s Subsidiaries are Unrestricted Subsidiaries, then the
quarterly and annual financial information required by (a) and (b) above will include a reasonably
detailed presentation, either on the face of the financial statements or in the footnotes thereto, of the
financial condition and results of operations of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries separate
from the financial condition and results of operations of the Unrestricted Subsidiaries.

All the financial statements and Pro forma financial information shall be prepared in accordance
with IFRS on a consistent basis for the periods presented. Except as provided for above, no report
need include separate financial statements or information for the Company or Subsidiaries of the
Company or any disclosure with respect to the results of operations or any other financial or statistical
disclosure not of a type included in the Offering Memorandum.

For purposes of this covenant, an acquisition or disposition shall be deemed ‘‘material’’ if the
business acquired or disposed of would constitute a ‘‘significant subsidiary,’’ as provided in
Rule 1-02(w) of Regulation S-X, substituting 20% for 10% in the tests therein.

Contemporaneously with the furnishing of each such report discussed above, the Company will also
post such report on the Company’s website or otherwise provide substantially comparable public
availability of such report. In the event that the Company becomes subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the U.S. Exchange Act, or elects to comply with such
provisions, the Company will, for so long as it continues to file the reports required by Section 13(a)
with the SEC, make available to the Trustee the annual reports, information, documents and other
reports that the Company is required to file with the SEC pursuant to such Section 13(a) or 15(d).
Upon complying with the foregoing requirement, the Company will be deemed to have complied with
the provisions contained in the preceding three paragraphs.

The Indentures will also provide that, so long as any of the Notes remain ‘‘restricted securities’’
within the meaning of Rule 501 under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the ‘‘U.S.
Securities Act’’) and during any period during which the Company is not subject to Section 13 or 15(d)
of the U.S. Exchange Act nor exempt therefrom pursuant to Rule 12g3-2(b), the Company will make
available to any prospective purchaser of the Notes or beneficial owner of Notes in connection with any
sale thereof the information required by Rule 144A(d)(4) under the U.S. Securities Act. The Company
will also make any of the foregoing information available during normal business hours at the offices of
the listing agent in Luxembourg if and so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the rules of that exchange so require.

131

Delivery of any information, documents or reports to the Trustee pursuant to this ‘‘Reports’’
covenant are for informational purposes only and the Trustee’s receipt of such shall not constitute
constructive notice of any information contained therein, including the Company’s compliance with any
of its covenants under the Indenture.

**_Limitation on lines of business_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, engage in any
business other than a Related Business or other than in connection with a Qualified Receivables
Financing.

**_Consolidation, merger and sale of assets_**

The Company will not merge or consolidate with or into any other entity (other than a merger or

assets in any one transaction or series of transactions unless the following requirements are satisfied:

(a) the Company shall be the surviving Person or the surviving Person (if other than the

(b) the Surviving Person (if other than the Company) expressly assumes, by supplemental

covenants relating to payment of principal, interest, premium and Additional Amounts,
of the Indentures to be performed by the Company;

(c) immediately before and after giving effect to such transaction or series of transactions
on a _Pro forma basis (and treating any Debt which becomes, or is anticipated to_
become, an obligation of the Surviving Person or any Restricted Subsidiary as a result
such transaction or series of transactions as having been Incurred by the Surviving
Person or such Restricted Subsidiary at the time of such transaction or series of
transactions), no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing;

(d) immediately after giving effect to such transaction or series of transactions on a Pro
_forma basis (and treating any Debt which becomes, or is anticipated to become, an_

transaction or series of transactions as having been Incurred by the Surviving Person or
such Restricted Subsidiary at the time of such transaction or series of transactions),
(i) the Company or the Surviving Person (if other than the Company) would be able to
Incur at least A1.00 of additional Debt under clause (i) of the first paragraph of the
covenant described under ‘‘—Limitation on Debt,’’ or (ii) the Consolidated Coverage
Ratio would be greater than or equal to the Consolidated Coverage Ratio immediately
prior to giving Pro forma effect to such transaction or transactions; and

(e) in connection with any consolidation, merger, transfer or other transaction
contemplated by this provision, the Company shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to
the Trustee, in form satisfactory to the Trustee, an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion
of Counsel, each stating that such consolidation, merger, transfer or other transaction
and the supplemental indentures in respect thereto comply with this provision and that
all conditions precedent herein provided for relating to such transaction or transactions
have been complied with and that the supplemental indentures, the relevant Indenture
and the Notes will be the legal, valid and binding obligations of the Surviving Person
or the Company, enforceable in accordance with their terms.

Notwithstanding anything in this covenant to the contrary: (i) the Company (A) may merge with
an Affiliate that has no material assets or liabilities and that is incorporated or organized solely for the

132


-----

purpose of reincorporating or reorganizing the Company in any state of the United States, the District
of Columbia or any state which is a European Union Member State and (B) may otherwise convert its
legal form under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization, in each case, without complying with
clause (d) of the preceding paragraph and (ii) any transaction characterized as a merger under
applicable law where each of the constituent entities survives, shall not be treated as a merger for
purposes of this covenant, but shall instead be treated as (x) an Asset Sale, if the result of such
transaction is the transfer of assets by the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, or (y) an Investment, if
the result of such transaction is the acquisition of assets by the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary.

Upon assumption by the Surviving Person of the obligations of the Company under the Indentures,
the Surviving Person will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of
the Company under the Indentures, and the predecessor (except in the case of a lease) and the
Company will be released from its obligations under the Indentures.

**_Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries_**

The Board of Directors of the Company may designate or redesignate any Subsidiary of the
Company or any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary if (i) the Subsidiary to be so
designated does not own any Capital Stock, Redeemable Stock or Debt of, or own or hold any Lien on
any property or assets of, the Company or any other Restricted Subsidiary, (ii) the Subsidiary to be so
designated is not obligated by any Debt, Lien or other obligation that, if in default, would result (with
the passage of time or notice or otherwise) in a default on any Debt of the Company or any Restricted
Subsidiary and (iii) such designation complies with the covenant described under ‘‘—Limitation on
Restricted Payments.’’ For purposes of the covenant described under ‘‘—Limitation on Restricted
Payments,’’ ‘‘Investment’’ will include the portion (proportionate to the Company’s equity interest in a
Restricted Subsidiary to be designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary) of the Fair Market Value of the
net assets of such Restricted Subsidiary at the time that such Restricted Subsidiary is designated an
Unrestricted Subsidiary; provided, however, that upon a redesignation of such Subsidiary as a Restricted
Subsidiary, the Company will be deemed to continue to have a permanent ‘‘Investment’’ in an
Unrestricted Subsidiary in an amount (if positive) equal to (a) the company’s ‘‘Investment’’ in such
Subsidiary at the time of such redesignation less (b) the portion (proportionate to the Company’s
equity interest in such Subsidiary) of the Fair Market Value of the net assets (as conclusively
determined by the Board of Directors of the Company in good faith) of such Subsidiary at the time
that such Subsidiary is so re-designated a Restricted Subsidiary. Unless so designated as an
Unrestricted Subsidiary, any Person that becomes a Subsidiary of the Company or of any Restricted
Subsidiary will be classified as a Restricted Subsidiary. Except as provided in the first sentence of this
paragraph, no Restricted Subsidiary may be redesignated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary. Any such
designation by the Board of Directors of the Company will be evidenced to the Trustee by the
Company by promptly filing with the Trustee a copy of the resolution of such Board of Directors giving
effect to such designation and delivering an Officer’s Certificate, in form satisfactory to the Trustee,
certifying that such designation complies with the foregoing provisions.

The Company will not, and will not permit any Unrestricted Subsidiary to, take any action or enter
into any transaction or series of transactions that would result in a Person becoming a Restricted
Subsidiary (whether through an acquisition, the redesignation of an Unrestricted Subsidiary or
otherwise) unless after giving effect to such action, transaction or series of transactions, on a Pro forma
basis, (i)(a) the Company could Incur at least A1.00 of additional Debt pursuant to clause (i) of the
first paragraph of the covenant described under ‘‘—Limitation on Debt,’’ or (b) the Consolidated
Coverage Ratio would be greater than or equal to the Consolidated Coverage Ratio immediately prior
to giving _Pro forma effect to such transaction or transactions and (ii) no Default or Event of Default_
would occur or be continuing.

**_Impairment of security interest_**

(a) Subject to paragraph (b) below, the Company will not, and will not permit any
Restricted Subsidiary to, take, or knowingly or negligently omit to take, any action,
which action or omission might or would have the result of materially impairing the
security interest with respect to the Collateral (it being understood that none of (i) the
implementation of the Permitted Reorganization, (ii) the discharge and release of
Collateral in accordance with the Indentures or (iii) the Incurrence of Permitted
Collateral Liens will, under any circumstances, be deemed to materially impair the

133


-----

Security Interest with respect to the Collateral) for the benefit of the Holders of
Notes, and the Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to,
grant to any Person other than the Trustee or the Security Trustee, for the benefit of
the Holders, the Trustee, the Security Trustee and the other beneficiaries described in
the Security Documents, any interest whatsoever in any of the Collateral.

(b) At the direction of the Company and without the consent of the Holders, the Security
Trustee will from time to time enter into one or more amendments to the Security
Documents to: (i) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency therein,
(ii) Incur Permitted Collateral Liens, (iii) provide for the Permitted Reorganization,
(iv) add to the Collateral, (v) provide for the discharge and release of the Collateral in
accordance with the Indentures or (vi) make any other change thereto that does not
adversely affect the Holders in any respect (including to permit the incurrence of Debt
by the issuance of Additional Notes permitted to be incurred pursuant to the covenant
described under ‘‘—Limitation on Debt’’ (any such issuance, an ‘‘Additional Notes
Issuance’’)); provided, however, that no Security Document may be amended, extended,
renewed, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified or replaced, unless in
compliance with the Intercreditor Agreement and contemporaneously with such
amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification or replacement,
the Company delivers to the Trustee either (1) a solvency opinion, in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee from an Independent Appraiser
confirming the solvency of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension,
renewal, restatement, supplement, modification or replacement; (2) a certificate from
the board of directors or chief financial officer of the Company (acting in good faith)
that confirms the solvency of the Person granting such Lien after giving effect to any
transaction related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, replacement,
supplement, modification or release or (3) an Opinion of Counsel, subject to
customary limitations, in form and substance satisfactory to the Trustee confirming
that, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension,
renewal, restatement, supplement, modification or replacement, the Lien or Liens
(other than in respect of Liens on assets that have been added to the Collateral as a
result of such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification
or replacement) securing the Notes (other than any Additional Notes) created under
the Security Documents so amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented or
otherwise modified or replaced are valid and perfected Liens not otherwise subject to
any limitation, imperfection or new hardening period (other than in the case of an
Additional Notes Issuance), in equity or at law, that such Lien or Liens were not
otherwise subject to immediately prior to such amendment, extension, renewal,
restatement, supplement, modification or replacement.

**_Modification of the Intercompany Loans_**

Except (a) to the extent necessary in connection with the Permitted Reorganization or (b) in the
case of clause (v) below only, to the extent the Company complies with the covenant ‘‘Impairment of
security interest’’ and/or provides the documents required by clauses (b)(1), (2) or (3) of such covenant,
the Company will not and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (i) to change the Stated
Maturity of the principal of, or any installment of interest on, the Intercompany Loans; (ii) to reduce
the rate of interest on the Intercompany Loans to below the interest rate of the Fixed Rate Notes
and/or the Floating Rate Notes, as applicable; (iii) to change the currency for payment of any amount
under the Intercompany Loans; (iv) to prepay or otherwise reduce or permit the prepayment or
reduction of the Intercompany Loans (save to facilitate a corresponding payment of principal on the
Notes); (v) to assign or novate the Intercompany Loans (except as permitted under the Indentures); or
(vi) to amend, modify or alter the Intercompany Loans in any manner materially adverse to the
Holders of Notes, except as necessary to eliminate or minimize any present or future material tax, duty,
levy, import, assessment or other material governmental charge; or (vii) to take any action at any
meeting in respect of the holders of the Intercompany Loans which may be materially adverse to the
interests of the Holders of the Notes or have the effect of impairing the Intercompany Loans.

134


-----

**_Post-Closing obligations with respect to grant of guarantee and security_**

The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, ensure that, promptly after the transfer by
Torraspapel S.A. of its distribution business to Dispap S.A., and in no event later than 15 days
thereafter,

(a) Dispap S.A. shall execute supplemental indentures and become a Guarantor of the
Notes;

(b) Torraspapel S.A. will enter into a pledge agreement in favor of the Security Trustee
with respect to the entire issued share capital of Dispap S.A., which shall form part of
the Collateral;

(c) Sub Lecta S.A. will enter into pledges or assignments in favor of the Security Trustee
with respect to certain receivables payable by Dispap S.A., which shall form part of the
Collateral; and

(d) Dispap S.A. will enter into pledges or assignments in favor of the Security Trustee with
respect to certain receivables and bank accounts, which shall form part of the
Collateral.

**_Suspension of Certain Covenants When Notes Rated Investment Grade_**

If on any date following the date of the Indentures, (1) the Notes are rated (a) Baa3 or better by
Moody’s and (b) BBB- or better by S&P (or, if either Moody’s or S&P ceases to rate the Notes for
reasons outside of the control of the Company, the equivalent investment grade credit rating from
Fitch Ratings or, in the absence of such, any other ‘‘nationally recognized statistical rating
organization’’ within the meaning of Rule 15c3-1(c)(2)(vi)(F) under the U.S. Exchange Act selected by
the Company as a replacement agency so that the Notes are so rated by at least two such credit rating
agencies); and (2) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Company
shall notify the Trustee and then, beginning on that day and subject to the provisions of the following
paragraph, the covenants specifically listed under the following captions will be suspended:

(1) ‘‘—Limitation on Debt;’’

(2) ‘‘—Limitation on Restricted Payments;’’

(3) ‘‘—Transactions with Affiliates;’’

(4) ‘‘—Limitation on guarantees of Debt by Restricted Subsidiaries;’’

(5) ‘‘—Limitation on restrictions on distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries;’’ and

(6) ‘‘—Limitation on sales of assets and Restricted Subsidiary stock.’’

During any period that the foregoing covenants have been suspended, the Company’s Board of
Directors may not designate any of its Subsidiaries as Unrestricted Subsidiaries pursuant to the
covenant described above under the caption ‘‘—Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries.’’

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the rating assigned by any such Rating Agency should
subsequently decline to below Baa3 or BBB-, as applicable, the foregoing covenants will be reinstituted
as of and from the date of such rating decline, and, upon any such event, the Company shall promptly
notify the Trustee. Such covenants will not, however, be of any effect with respect to actions properly
taken during the period of suspension. Calculations under the reinstated ‘‘—Limitation on Restricted
Payments’’ covenant will be made as if the ‘‘—Limitation on Restricted Payments’’ covenant had been
in effect since the date of the Indentures except that no default will be deemed to have occurred by
reason of a Restricted Payment made while that covenant was suspended. There can be no assurance
that the Notes will ever achieve an investment grade rating or that any such rating will be maintained.

**Defaults**

An ‘‘Event of Default’’ will occur under the relevant Indentures if:

(i) the Company fails to make any payment of interest (including Additional Amounts) on
any Note when the same shall become due and payable, and such failure continues for
a period of 30 days;

135


-----

(ii) the Company fails to make the payment of the principal or premium, if any, on any
Note when the same becomes due and payable at its Stated Maturity, upon
declaration, redemption, acceleration, required purchase or otherwise;

(iii) the Company fails to comply with any of its respective covenants or agreements
described under ‘‘—Certain covenants—Consolidation, merger and sale of assets;’’

(iv) the Company fails to comply with its obligations under the covenants described under
‘‘—Change of Control’’ above or under the covenants described under ‘‘—Certain
covenants’’ (other than a failure to purchase Notes which will constitute an Event of
Default under clause (ii) and other than a failure to comply with ‘‘—Certain
covenants—Consolidation, merger and sale of assets’’ which will constitute an Event of
Default under clause (iii)) and such failure continues for a period of 30 days after the
notice specified below;

(v) the Company fails to comply with any of the covenants in the Indentures (other than
those specified in clauses (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv)) and such failure continues for a period
of 60 days after the notice specified below;

(vi) Debt of the Company or any Significant Restricted Subsidiary (or any other Restricted
Subsidiary if such Debt is, or with the giving of notice or the passage of time or
otherwise may become, directly or indirectly, recourse to the Company or any
Significant Restricted Subsidiary) is not paid within any applicable grace period after
final maturity or is accelerated by the holders thereof and the total amount of such
Debt unpaid or accelerated exceeds A20 million or its equivalent;

(vii) any judgment or decree aggregating in an uninsured amount in excess of A20 million or
its equivalent at the time is rendered against the Company or any Significant
Restricted Subsidiary (or any other Restricted Subsidiary if such judgment or decree is,
or with the giving of notice or the passage of time or otherwise may become, directly
or indirectly, recourse to the Company or any Significant Restricted Subsidiary) and
there is a period of 60 days following the entry of such judgment or decree during
which such judgment or decree is not discharged, waived or the execution thereof
stayed or is not covered by indemnities or third party insurance as to which the Person
giving such indemnity or such insurer has not discharged coverage and such default
continues for ten days after the notice specified below;

(viii) the Company or any Significant Restricted Subsidiary pursuant to or within the
meaning of any Bankruptcy Law (A) commences a voluntary case, (B) consents to the
entry of an order for relief against it in an involuntary case, (C) consents to the
appointment of a Custodian of it or for any substantial part of its property or
(D) makes a general assignment for the benefit of its creditors; or takes any
comparable action under any laws relating to insolvency or laws having a similar effect
for creditors;

(ix) a court of competent jurisdiction enters an order or decree under any Bankruptcy Law
that: (A) is for relief against the Company or any Significant Restricted Subsidiary in
an involuntary case, (B) appoints a Custodian of the Company or any Significant
Restricted Subsidiary or for any substantial part of its property, or (C) orders the
winding up or liquidation of the Company or any Significant Restricted Subsidiary; or
any similar relief is granted under any foreign laws, and, in each case, the order or
decree remains unstayed and in effect for 60 days;

(x) any Guarantee ceases to be, or is asserted by any Guarantor, or any Person acting on
behalf of any Guarantor, not to be in full force and effect or enforceable in accordance
with its terms (other than as provided for in the Indentures or any Guarantee) and any
such Default continues uncured for a period of 21 days; or

(xi) the security interest purported to be created under any Security Document with respect
to Collateral having a Fair Market Value in excess of A5.0 million, at any time, ceases
to be in full force and effect and to constitute a valid and perfected Lien with the
priority required by such Security Document and/or the Intercreditor Agreement for
any reason other than the satisfaction in full of all obligations under the relevant

136


-----

Indenture and discharge of the relevant Indenture or in accordance with the terms of
the relevant Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement or any security interest
purported to be created under any such Security Document is declared invalid or
unenforceable or any Person granting any such security interest asserts in any pleading
in any court of competent jurisdiction that any such security interest is invalid or
unenforceable and (but only in the event that such failure to be in full force and effect
or such assertion is capable of being cured without imposing any new hardening
period, in equity or at law, that such security interest was not otherwise subject
immediately prior to such failure or assertion) such failure to be in full force and effect
or such assertion has continued uncured for a period of 21 days; provided, however,
that any such cessation, declaration, or assertion shall not constitute a Default
hereunder unless it shall adversely affect in a material respect the condition or the
value of the Collateral, taken as a whole.

A Default under clause (iv) or (v) will not be an Event of Default until the Trustee notifies the
Company or the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding
notify the Company and the Trustee in writing of the Default and the Company does not cure such
Default within the time specified after receipt of such notice. Such notice must specify the Default,
demand that it be remedied and state that such notice is a ‘‘Notice of Default.’’

For the avoidance of doubt, the voluntary liquidation or dissolution of a Significant Restricted
Subsidiary in connection with the transfer of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of such
Significant Restricted Subsidiary to another Significant Restricted Subsidiary in compliance with the
terms of the Indentures shall not constitute an Event of Default.

The Company will deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written
notice in the form of an Officer’s Certificate of any event which, with the giving of notice and the lapse
of time, would become an Event of Default under clause (iv) or (v), its status and what action the
Company is taking or proposes to take with respect thereto.

If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default specified in clause (viii) or (ix)) occurs and
is continuing, the Trustee, by notice in writing to the Company, or the Holders of at least 25% in
aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding by notice to the Company and the Trustee,
may, and the Trustee, if directed by Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes
then outstanding, shall declare the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued interest on all Notes to
be due and payable and instruct the Security Trustee to enforce the Security Documents. Upon such
declaration, such principal accrued interest will be due and payable immediately. If an Event of Default
specified in clause (viii) or (ix) occurs, the principal of and interest on all the Notes will ipso facto
become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the
Trustee or any Holders of the Notes and the Security Documents will ipso facto become immediately
enforceable. After any such acceleration, but before a judgment or decree based on such acceleration is
obtained by the Trustee, the registered Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the
Notes then outstanding may, under certain circumstances, rescind and annul such acceleration if all
Events of Default, other than the non-payment of accelerated principal, premium or interest, have been
cured or waived as provided in the Indentures.

The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes by notice to the Trustee may
waive an existing Default and its consequences except (i) a Default in the payment of the principal of,
premium if any, or interest on a Note or (ii) a Default in respect of a provision that cannot be
amended without the consent of Holders of a percentage higher than 50.1% of the aggregate principal
amount of Notes affected. When a Default is waived, it is deemed cured, but no such waiver will
extend to any subsequent or other Default or impair any consequent right.

The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes may direct the time, method
and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any
trust or power conferred on the Trustee. However, the Trustee may refuse to follow any direction that
conflicts with law or the Indentures or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of
other Holders or would involve the Trustee in personal liability; provided, however, that the Trustee may
take any other action deemed proper by the Trustee that is not inconsistent with such direction. Prior
to taking any action under the Indentures, the Trustee will be entitled to indemnification and/or
security satisfactory to it in its sole discretion against all losses and expenses caused by taking or not
taking such action.

137


-----

A Holder of Notes may not pursue any remedy with respect to the Indentures or the Notes unless:
(i) such Holder gives to the Trustee written notice stating that an Event of Default is continuing;
(ii) Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding make a
written request to the Trustee to pursue the remedy; (iii) such Holder or Holders offer to the Trustee
reasonable security and/or indemnity satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense; (iv) the
Trustee does not comply with the request within 60 days after receipt of the request and the offer of
security and/or indemnity; and (v) the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes do not
give the Trustee a written direction inconsistent with the request during such 60-day period.

**Amendments and waivers**

Subject to certain exceptions, each Indenture, each series of Notes, the Intercreditor Agreement
and the Security Documents may be amended or supplemented with the consent of the Holders of at
least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including consents
obtained in connection with a consent solicitation, tender offer or exchange for the Notes) acting as a
single class and any existing or past default or compliance with any provisions may be waived with the
consent of the Holders of at least a majority in an aggregate principal amount of the Notes then
outstanding acting as a class. However, without the consent of Holders of at least 90% of the aggregate
principal amount of the outstanding Notes affected thereby, no amendment may, (i) reduce the amount
of Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment, (ii) reduce the rate of or extend the time for
payment of interest on any Note, (iii) reduce the principal of or extend the Stated Maturity of any
Note, (iv) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any Note or change the time or times
at which any Notes may or shall be redeemed, (v) make any Note payable in money other than that
stated in the Note, (vi) impair the right of any Holder of Notes to institute suit for the enforcement of
any payment on or with respect to any Notes, or (vii) release any security that may have been granted
in respect of the Notes other than pursuant to the terms of the Security Documents, the Intercreditor
Agreement or as otherwise permitted under the Indentures. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Indentures may be amended with the consent of Holders of 66[2]⁄3% of the aggregate principal amount
of outstanding Notes to release a Guarantee (if such consent is required by the Indentures).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any amendment, waiver or other modification affects only the
rights of the Floating Rate Notes or the Fixed Rate Notes, as applicable, the holders of the other series
of Notes shall not be required to consent thereto (and in such case, the consent of a majority or 90%,
as the case may be, in aggregate principal amount of the affected series of Notes shall be required to
consent thereto). For the avoidance of doubt, it is understood and agreed that any matter described in
clauses (ii), (iii), (iv) and (v) in the previous paragraph that by its terms applies only to the Floating
Rate Notes or the Fixed Rate Notes shall not be deemed to affect the rights of, or require the consent
of, the holders of the other series of Notes and shall require only the consent of 90% of the holders of
the Floating Rate Notes or the Fixed Rate Notes, as the case may be.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any Holder of the Notes, the Company, the
Guarantors, the Security Trustee and the Trustee (as applicable) may amend or supplement the
Indentures, the Notes, the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents to cure any ambiguity,
omission, defect or inconsistency, to provide for the assumption by a Surviving Person of the obligations
of the Company under the Indentures, to provide for the issuance of Additional Notes in accordance
with the limitations set forth in the Indentures and to make such changes as may be required to the
Security Documents to accommodate and implement such issuance of Additional Notes, to the extent
necessary to provide for the granting of a security interest for the benefit of any Person, provided that
the granting of such security interest is not prohibited under the Indentures, to provide for
uncertificated Notes in addition to or in place of certificated Notes (provided, that the uncertificated
Notes are issued in registered form for purposes of Section 163(f) of the Code), evidence and provide
for the acceptance and appointment under the Indentures of a successor trustee pursuant to the
requirements thereof, comply with the rules of any applicable securities depository, conform the text of
the Indentures, the Notes, the Guarantees, the Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents to
any provision of this ‘‘Description of the Notes’’ to the extent that such provision in the Description of
the Notes was intended to be a verbatim recitation of a provision of the Indentures, the Notes, the
Guarantees, the Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents, to add Guarantees with respect to
the Notes or release a Guarantor upon its designation as an Unrestricted Subsidiary or as otherwise
permitted by the Indentures; provided, however, that the release is in accordance with the applicable
provisions of the Indentures, to secure the Notes and to amend the mechanical provisions to facilitate

138


-----

release of all or any portion of the Collateral pursuant to the terms of the Indentures, to add to the
covenants of the Company for the benefit of the Holders of the Notes or to surrender any right or
power conferred upon the Company, or make any change that does not adversely affect the rights of
any Holder of the Notes.

The consent of the Holders of the Notes is not necessary under the Indentures to approve the
particular form of any proposed amendment. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of
the proposed amendment. A consent to any amendment or waiver under the Indentures by any Holder
of Notes given in connection with a tender of such Holder’s Notes will not be rendered invalid by such
tender.

After an amendment under the Indentures becomes effective, the Company is required deliver to
each Holder in accordance with the provisions set forth under ‘‘—Notices’’ a notice briefly describing
such amendment. However, the failure to give such notice to all Holders of the Notes, or any defect
therein, will not impair or affect the validity of the amendment.

**Additional or Amended Intercreditor Agreements**

The Indentures will provide that, at the direction of the Company and without the consent of the
Holders of Notes, the Trustee and the Security Trustee shall from time to time enter into an additional
intercreditor agreement (each an ‘‘Additional Intercreditor Agreement’’) on terms substantially similar
to the Intercreditor Agreement or one or more amendments to the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement to (A) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency of the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, (B) increase the amount of Debt
of the types covered by the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement that
may be Incurred by the Company or a Guarantor that is subject to the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement (including the addition of provisions relating to new Debt ranking
equal to or junior in right of payment to the Notes or the Guarantees, as applicable), (C) add
Guarantors to the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, (D) further
secure the Notes (including Additional Notes), or (E) make any other such change to the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement that does not adversely affect the Holders of
Notes in any material respect.

The Company shall not otherwise direct the Trustee or the Security Trustee to enter into any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement or amendment to the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement without the consent of the Holders of the majority in aggregate principal
amount of the Notes then outstanding, except as otherwise permitted under this covenant, and the
Company may only direct the Trustee and the Security Trustee to enter into any amendment to the
extent that such amendment does not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or the Security
Trustee or adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of the Trustee or the Security
Trustee under the Indentures or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement.

Each Holder of Notes, by accepting a Note, shall be deemed to have agreed to and accepted the
terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement
(whether then entered into or entered into in the future pursuant to the provisions described herein).
A copy of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement shall be made
available for inspection during normal business hours on any Business Day upon prior written request
at the offices of the Trustee and, for so long as any Notes are listed on the Official List of the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, at the
offices of the Registrar in Luxembourg.

All references in this ‘‘Description of the Notes’’ to the Intercreditor Agreement shall, where
appropriate, also refer to any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

Each Indenture (and all Liens on the Collateral created pursuant to the Security Documents
applicable to such Indenture) and the Guarantees applicable to such Indenture will be discharged and
will cease to be of further effect (except as otherwise expressly provided for in the applicable
Indenture) when either (i) all outstanding Notes issued pursuant to the applicable Indenture have been
delivered (other than lost, stolen or destroyed Notes which have been replaced) to the Trustee for

139


-----

cancellation or (ii) all outstanding Notes issued pursuant to the applicable Indenture not theretofore
delivered to the Trustee for cancellation have become due and payable by reason of the making of a
notice of redemption or otherwise or will become due and payable by reason of the making of a notice
of redemption or otherwise within one year and the Company has irrevocably deposited with the
Trustee, or such other entity designated by the Trustee for this purpose, cash in euro or
euro-denominated European Government Obligations or a combination thereof sufficient to pay at
maturity or upon redemption all outstanding Notes issued pursuant to the applicable Indenture,
including interest thereon (other than lost, stolen or destroyed Notes which have been replaced), and,
in either case, the Company has paid all sums payable by it under the applicable Indenture. If
requested by the Company, the Trustee may distribute any amounts deposited in trust to the Holders
prior to maturity or the redemption date, as the case may be; provided, however, that the Holders shall
have received at least five Business Days’ notice from the Company of such earlier payment date
(which may be included in a notice of redemption); provided, further that, for the avoidance of doubt,
the Trustee shall not distribute such amounts deposited in trust to Holders prior to the fifth Business
Day following the date of publication of any such redemption notice, to the extent applicable. The
Trustee shall not be liable to any Person (including, without limitation, any Holder) for making any
payments at the request of the Company and the indemnities from the Company and/or Guarantors
contained in the Indentures shall extend to any actions of the Trustee taken, and any losses and
liabilities incurred by the Trustee (including, without limitation, any claims that may be brought by
Holders), in connection with such request. The Trustee will be required to acknowledge satisfaction and
discharge of the applicable Indenture on written demand of the Company accompanied by an Officer’s
Certificate at the cost and expense of the Company.

**Defeasance**

The Company may, at any time, terminate (i) all obligations under the Notes, the Guarantees and
the Indentures (‘‘legal defeasance option’’) or (ii) obligations to comply with certain restrictive
covenants, including certain of the covenants described under ‘‘—Certain covenants’’ (‘‘covenant
defeasance option’’). The Company may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding any prior
exercise of their covenant defeasance option.

If the Company exercises its legal defeasance option, payment of the Notes may not be accelerated
because of an Event of Default. If the Company exercises its covenant defeasance option, payment of
the Notes may not be accelerated because of certain Events of Default described under ‘‘—Defaults’’
(not including, among others, Events of Default relating to non-payment, bankruptcy and insolvency
events) or because of the failure of the Company to comply with certain covenants specified in the
Indentures. If the Company exercises its legal defeasance option or its covenant defeasance option,
each Guarantor will be released from all of its obligations with respect to its Guarantee and the
Collateral will be released as security for the Notes.

The Company may exercise its legal defeasance option or its covenant defeasance option only if
(1) the Company irrevocably deposits in trust with the Trustee, or such other entity designated by the
Trustee for this purpose, cash in euro or euro-denominated European Government Obligations or a
combination thereof, for the payment of principal of and interest on the Notes to maturity or
redemption, as the case may be; (2) the Company delivers to the Trustee a certificate from a nationally
recognized firm of independent certified public accountants expressing their opinion that the amount of
cash in euro or euro-denominated European Government Obligations deposited pursuant to clause (1)
will without reinvestment provide cash at such times and in such amounts as will be sufficient to pay
principal and interest when due on all the Notes to maturity or redemption, as the case may be;
(3) 184 days pass after the deposit is made and during the 184-day period, no Default described in
clause (viii) or (ix) under ‘‘—Defaults’’ occurs which is continuing at the end of the period; (4) the
deposit does not constitute a default under any other agreement or instrument binding on the
Company; (5) the Company delivers to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel satisfactory to the Trustee in
its sole discretion to the effect that the trust resulting from the deposit does not constitute, or is
qualified as, a regulated investment company under the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940, as
amended; (6) in the case of the legal defeasance option, the Company delivers to the Trustee an
Opinion of Counsel satisfactory to the Trustee in its sole discretion stating that (i) the Company has
received from, or there has been published by, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service a ruling, or (ii) since
the date of the relevant Indenture there has been a change in the applicable U.S. federal income tax
law, to the effect, in either case, that, and based thereon such Opinion of Counsel shall confirm that,

140


-----

the Holders of the Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes
as a result of such defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amounts, in
the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such defeasance had not
occurred, provided, however, such Opinion of Counsel shall not be required if all the Notes will become
due and payable on the Maturity Date within one year or are to be called for redemption within one
year under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee; (7) in the case of the covenant defeasance option,
the Company delivers to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel satisfactory to the Trustee in its sole
discretion to the effect that the Holders of the Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S.
federal income tax purposes as a result of such covenant defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal
income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the
case if such covenant defeasance had not occurred; and (8) the Company delivers to the Trustee an
Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent relating to
the defeasance and discharge of the Notes have been complied with as required by the Indentures.

**Notices**

Notices to Holders of Notes (while any Notes are represented by one or more global notes) shall
be delivered to Euroclear and Clearstream for communication to entitled account holders, or in the
case of definitive Notes, shall be given by mail to the addresses of Holders of such Notes appearing on
the register for such Note, and in each case shall be published (so long as the Notes are listed on the
Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the rules of that exchange so require) in a leading

**No personal liability of directors, officers, employees and stockholders**

No past, present or future director, officer, employee, incorporator, promoter, advisor or
stockholder of the Company or any Guarantor, as such, will have any liability for any obligations of the
Company or the Guarantors under the Notes, the Indentures, the Guarantees, the Security Documents
or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each
Holder of Notes by accepting a Note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are
part of the consideration for issuance of the Notes.

**Concerning the Trustee**

Deutsche Trustee Company Limited will be the Trustee under the Indentures. The Trustee’s
current specified address is Winchester House, 1 Great Winchester Street, London EC2N 2DB.

The Indentures will provide that, except during the continuance of an Event of Default, the
Trustee will perform only such duties as are specifically set forth in the Indentures. During the
existence of an Event of Default, the Trustee will exercise such rights and powers vested in it by the
Indentures, and use the same degree of care and skill as a prudent man would exercise or use under
the circumstances in the conduct of his own affairs.

Subject to such provisions, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of its rights or
powers under the Indentures (including, without limitation, directing the Security Trustee to enforce
any of the Security Documents) at the request of any Holder of Notes, unless such Holder has offered
to the Trustee security and/or indemnity satisfactory to it against loss, liability or expense as provided in
the Indentures.

The Indentures will provide for the indemnification of the Trustee and for its relief from
responsibility in connection with its actions under the applicable Indenture. The Intercreditor
Agreement will provide that the Trustee is entitled to be paid amounts in respect of its fees, costs and
expenses and claims under any indemnity in priority to payments to other creditors, including Holders
of the Notes. The Indentures will provide that the Trustee may rely absolutely, without further enquiry,
on any certificates, reports, opinions or other documents (whether or not any such document contains
any limit on liability) from the Company, its subsidiaries, legal counsel, auditors, valuers and/or any
other experts. The Trustee will not be responsible for the adequacy or fitness of any of the Collateral as
security in relation to the notes. The Trustee will not be responsible for any loss, expense or liability
which may be suffered as a result of any inadequacy of the Collateral.

141


-----

The Indentures will set out the terms under which the Trustee may retire or be removed, and
replaced. Such terms will include, among others, (1) that the Trustee may be removed at any time by
the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes, or may resign at any time
by giving written notice to the Company and (2) that if the Trustee at any time (a) has or acquires a
conflict of interest in its capacity as Trustee that is not eliminated, (b) fails to meet certain eligibility
requirements or (c) becomes incapable of acting as Trustee or becomes insolvent or bankrupt, then the
Company may remove the Trustee, or any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder for not less than six
months may petition any court for removal of the Trustee and appointment of a successor Trustee.

**Paying agent and Registrar for the Notes**

The Company will maintain a paying agent for the Notes in the City of London. The initial paying
agent will be Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, in London (the ‘‘Paying Agent’’).

The Company will also maintain one or more registrars (each, a ‘‘Registrar’’) with offices in
Luxembourg and a transfer agent in each of (i) the City of London and (ii) for so long as the Notes
are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and its rules so require, Luxembourg.
The initial Registrar will be Deutsche Bank Luxembourg, S.A. The initial transfer agents will be
Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, in London and Deutsche Bank Luxembourg, S.A., in
Luxembourg. The Registrar and the Transfer Agent in Luxembourg will maintain a register reflecting
ownership of certificated securities (the ‘‘Definitive Registered Notes’’) outstanding from time to time
and will make payments on and facilitate transfers of Definitive Registered Notes on behalf of the
Company. Each transfer agent shall perform the functions of a transfer agent.

The Company may change any Paying Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent for the Notes without
prior notice to the Holders of such Notes. However, for so long as the Notes are listed on the Euro
MTF Market of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and its rules so require, the Company will deliver
notice of the change in a paying agent, Registrar or transfer agent on the website of the Luxembourg
Stock Exchange at www.bourse.lu. The Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries may act as paying
agent or Registrar in respect of the Notes.

**Consent to jurisdiction and service of process**

The Indentures will provide that the Company and each Guarantor will irrevocably appoint
Corporation Service Company as their agent for service of process in any suit, action or proceeding
with respect to the Indentures, the Notes or any Guarantee brought in any U.S. federal or state court
located in the Borough of Manhattan, City and State of New York and that each of the parties submit
to the jurisdiction thereof.

**Governing law**

The Indentures will provide that they, each Guarantee and the Notes will be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York. For the avoidance of doubt, the
provisions of articles 86 to 94-8 of the Luxembourg law dated August 10, 1915, on commercial
companies, as amended, are excluded. The Intercreditor Agreement is governed by, and construed in
accordance with, English law. The Security Documents will be governed by, and construed in

**LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE GUARANTEES AND THE**
**SECURITY INTERESTS**

Set out below is a summary of certain limitations on the enforceability of the Guarantees and the
security interests in each of the jurisdictions in which the Guarantees and security interests are being
provided. It is a summary only, and proceedings of bankruptcy, insolvency or a similar event could be
initiated in any of these jurisdictions and in the jurisdiction of organization of a future Guarantor of
the Notes. The application of these various laws in multiple jurisdictions could trigger disputes over
which jurisdiction’s law should apply, and could adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights and
to collect payment in full under the Notes, the security interests or the Guarantees.

Also set forth below is a brief description of certain aspects of insolvency law in the European
Union, France, Italy, Luxembourg and Spain. In the event that any one or more of the Issuer, the
Guarantors or any other of Lecta S.A.’s subsidiaries experienced financial difficulty, it is not possible to
predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be
commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings.

**European Union**

**_Insolvency_**

Pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) no. 1346/2000 of May 29, 2010 on insolvency proceedings
(the ‘‘EU Insolvency Regulation’’), the court that shall have jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings
in relation to Lecta S.A. or any Guarantor will be the court of the Member State where the entity
concerned has its ‘‘centre of main interests’’ (as that term is used in Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency
Regulation). The determination of where Lecta S.A. or any Guarantor has its ‘‘centre of main
interests’’ would be a question of fact on which the courts of the different EU Member States may
have differing and even conflicting views. It should also be noted that no final decisions have been
taken in cases that have been brought before the European Court of Justice in relation to questions of
interpretation or the effects of the EU Insolvency Regulation throughout the European Union.
Furthermore, ‘‘centre of main interests’’ is not a static concept and may change from time to time.
Although under Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation there is a rebuttable presumption that
Lecta S.A. or a Guarantor would have its ‘‘centre of main interests’’ in the Member State in which it
has its registered office, Preamble 13 of the EU Insolvency Regulation states that the ‘‘centre of main
interests’’ of a debtor should correspond to the place where the debtor conducts the administration of
its interests on a regular basis and ‘‘is therefore ascertainable by third parties.’’ In that respect, factors
such as the place in which Lecta S.A. or a Guarantor holds board meetings, the place where Lecta S.A.
or a Guarantor conducts the majority of its business and the place where the large majority of
Lecta S.A.’s or a Guarantor’s creditors are established may all be relevant in the determination of the
place where Lecta S.A. or a Guarantor has its ‘‘centre of main interests.’’

If the ‘‘centre of main interests’’ of Lecta S.A. or a Guarantor is and will remain located in the
state in which it has its registered office, the main insolvency proceedings in respect of Lecta S.A. or a
Guarantor under the EU Insolvency Regulation would be commenced in such jurisdiction and
accordingly a court in such jurisdiction would be entitled to commence the types of insolvency
proceedings referred to in Annex A to the EU Insolvency Regulation. Insolvency proceedings opened
in one Member State under the EU Insolvency Regulation are to be recognized in other Member
States (other than Denmark), although secondary proceedings may be opened in another Member
State. If the ‘‘centre of main interests’’ of a debtor is in one Member State (other than Denmark)
under Article 3(2) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another Member State (other than
Denmark) may open ‘‘territorial proceedings’’ in the event that such debtor has an ‘‘establishment’’ in
the territory of such other Member State. If a debtor does not have an establishment in any other
Member State, no court of any other Member State shall have the ability to open territorial
proceedings in respect of such debtor under the EU Insolvency Regulation.

In the event that any of the Issuer, the Guarantors of any of their respective subsidiaries
experience financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or
jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced or the outcome of such
proceedings. Applicable insolvency laws may affect the enforceability of the obligations of the Issuer
and of the Guarantors.

**France**

**_Insolvency_**

The French Guarantors’ registered headquarters are in France and its center of main interest is
presumed to be located in France see (—‘‘European Union’’) and therefore any main insolvency
proceedings (within the meaning of the EU Insolvency Regulation) of the French Guarantors would be
opened in France unless this presumption is rebutted. Under certain circumstances, French insolvency
proceedings may also be opened with respect to companies that are not incorporated in France, mainly
if they have their center of main interest or an establishment in France.

French court-administered insolvency proceedings are either safeguard (sauvegarde), accelerated
safeguard (sauvegarde acc´el´er´ee), accelerated financial safeguard (sauvegarde financi`ere acc´el´er´ee),
reorganization or liquidation proceedings (redressement or liquidation judiciaire). Confidential
court-assisted proceedings also exist to help the debtor restructure its indebtedness in a consensual
manner (namely mandat ad hoc or conciliation proceedings).

In general, French insolvency legislation favors the continuation of a business and protection of
employment over the payment of creditors and could limit your ability to enforce your rights under the
Notes and/or the guarantees granted by the French Guarantors and the corresponding security
interests.

The following is a general discussion of insolvency proceedings governed by French law for
informational purposes only and does not address all the French legal considerations that may be
relevant to holders of the Notes.

_Grace periods_

In addition to insolvency laws discussed below, you could, like any other creditors, be subject to
articles 1244-1 et seq. of the French Code civil.

Pursuant to the provisions of these articles, French courts may, in any civil proceeding involving
the debtor, defer or otherwise reschedule over a maximum period of two years the payment dates of
payment obligations and decide that any amounts, the payment date of which is thus deferred or
rescheduled, will bear interest at a rate that is lower than the contractual rate (but not lower than the
legal rate as published annually by decree) or that payments made shall first be allocated to repayment
of the principal rather than interest. A court order made under article 1244-1 of the French Code civil
will automatically suspend any pending enforcement measures, and any contractual interest or penalty
for late payment will not accrue or be due during the period ordered by the court.

_Emergency procedure_

The statutory auditors of the company can request the management and the board of directors (if
the French Guarantor is incorporated under the legal form of a soci´et´e anonyme) to provide an
explanation as to elements which the auditors believe put the company’s existence as a going concern
in jeopardy. Failing satisfactory explanations or corrective measures, the auditors can request that a
shareholders’ meeting be convened. The auditors must inform the commercial court. Shareholders
representing at least 5% of the share capital and the workers’ committee have similar rights. The
commercial court can also itself summon the management to provide explanations on elements which
the court believe put the company’s existence as a going concern in jeopardy. Pursuant to the
provisions of article L. 611-2-1 of the French Code de commerce, the competent civil court (Tribunal de
_Grande Instance) will also be able to exercise the emergency procedure for debtors submitted to its_
jurisdiction.

_Court-assisted pre-insolvency proceedings_

A French company facing difficulties may request the opening of court-assisted pre-insolvency
proceedings (mandat ad hoc or conciliation) the aim of which is to reach an agreement with the
debtor’s main creditors. Mandat ad hoc and _conciliation are informal proceedings carried out under the_
supervision of the president of the court, which do not involve any automatic stay of the proceedings.

Contractual provisions pursuant to which the opening of the court-assisted pre-insolvency
proceedings, or a request thereof, change the terms of ongoing contracts (contrats en cours) by reducing
the rights or increasing the obligations of the debtor shall be null and void, according to

165


-----

article L. 611-16 of the French Code de commerce. Furthermore, any clause requiring the debtor, due
solely to the appointment of a _mandataire ad hoc or the opening of a conciliation procedure, to pay the_
fees of the creditor’s counsel in such proceedings, in excess of the proportion fixed by order of the
Minister of Justice (currently: 75% of the fees), shall be deemed null and void.

French law does not provide for any specific rule in respect of mandat ad hoc. In practice, mandat
_ad hoc proceedings are used by debtors that are facing difficulties of an economic or financial nature_
but are not in a state of cessation of payments (cessation de paiements) (i.e., the debtor is considered in
a state of cessation of payments where it is unable to pay its debts when they fall due with its liquid
assets (taking into account available credit lines and existing rescheduling agreements)). They are
confidential and are not limited in time. The agreement reached by the parties (if any) with the help of
the court-appointed officer (mandataire ad hoc) is reported by the latter to the court but is not
sanctioned by the court. The appointment of a mandataire ad hoc shall be brought to the attention of
the statutory auditors, according to article L. 611-3 of the French Code de commerce.

_Conciliation proceedings are available to a debtor that faces actual or foreseeable difficulties of a_
legal, economic or financial nature but which has not been insolvent for more than 45 days. The debtor
petitions the commercial court for the appointment of a conciliator in charge of assisting the debtor in
negotiating with all or part of its creditors and/or trade partners an agreement providing for the
restructuring of its indebtedness. Conciliation proceedings are confidential and may last up to five
months. During the proceedings, creditors may continue to sue individually for payment of their claims
but the debtor retains the right to petition for debt rescheduling pursuant to article 1244-1 of the Code
_civil. Upon its execution, the agreement reached by the parties becomes binding upon them and_
creditors may not take action against the company in respect of claims governed by the agreement. In
addition, without such formalities being an obligation on the parties, the agreement can be either:

  - upon all parties’ request, acknowledged (constat´e) by the president of the court, which makes
it immediately enforceable (ex´ecutoire); or

  - upon the debtor’s request, sanctioned (homologu´e) by the commercial court if (i) the debtor is
not insolvent at the time or if the rescheduling agreement has the effect of putting an end to
the debtor’s insolvency, (ii) if the rescheduling agreement effectively ensures that the company
will survive as a going concern, and (iii) the agreement is not violating the interest of the
non-signatory creditors; the judgment does not make public the terms of the agreement but
discloses the guarantees and priorities (privil`eges) granted to the creditors. Where the debtor
requests such sanction, the content of the agreement must be notified to the employee
representatives of the debtor, in accordance with article L. 611-8-1 of the French Code de
_commerce._

The debtor may request the Court to appoint the conciliator to supervise the performance of the
agreement (article L. 611-8 III of the French Code de commerce).

While the agreement (whether acknowledged or sanctioned) is being implemented, any individual
proceedings by creditors with respect to the claims included in the agreement are suspended. Subject to
the agreement having been sanctioned, creditors who have extended new credits to the debtor are
privileged in future proceedings. In case of breach of the agreement, any party to the agreement can
petition the Court for its termination.

_Court-administered proceedings—safeguard, reorganization and liquidation proceedings_

Court-administered proceedings may be initiated:

  - in the event of safeguard proceedings, upon petition by the debtor only; and

  - in the event of judicial reorganization or liquidation, upon petition by the debtor, any creditor
or the public prosecutor.

The debtor may file for safeguard proceedings at any time it is facing difficulties that it cannot
overcome, as long as it is not insolvent. It is required to petition for the opening of judicial
reorganization proceedings (if recovery is possible) or judicial liquidation proceedings (if recovery is
manifestly not possible) within 45 days of becoming insolvent. If it fails to do so, its directors and
officers are subject to civil liability.

166


-----

The period from the date of the court decision commencing the proceedings (whether a safeguard
or a judicial reorganization) to the date on which the court takes a decision on the outcome of the
proceedings is called the observation period and may last up to 18 months. During the observation
period, a court-appointed administrator, whose name can be suggested by the debtor in safeguard
proceedings, investigates the business of the company. In safeguard proceedings, the administrator’s
mission is limited to either supervising or assisting the debtor’s management and assisting it in
preparing a safeguard plan for the company. In judicial reorganization proceedings, the administrator’s
mission is usually to assist the management and to make proposals for the reorganization of the
company, which proposals may include the sale of all or part of the company’s business to a third party.

At the end of the observation period, if it considers that the company can survive as a going
concern, the court will adopt a safeguard or reorganization plan which will entail a restructuring and/or
rescheduling of debts and may entail the divestiture of some or all of the debtor’s assets and businesses
(a sale of the entire business is not possible in a safeguard plan). Unlike in safeguard proceedings, at
the end of the observation period of judicial reorganization proceedings and, alternatively to a
reorganization plan, the court may determine that all or part of the business should be sold to
purchasers who have submitted bids, in the framework of an asset sale plan (plan de cession) whereby
the court orders the transfer to the purchaser of the assets, contract, and number of employees
mentioned in its bid. The sale price may be significantly lower than the aggregate value of the assets, as
the court takes into account the number of jobs preserved by the purchaser, which is a key objective
under French insolvency law.

If the court adopts a safeguard plan, a reorganization plan or a plan for the sale of the business, it
can set a time period during which the assets that it deems to be essential to the continued business of
the debtor may not be sold without its consent. At any time during safeguard proceedings, the court
may convert such proceedings into reorganization proceedings (i) upon its own initiative, if the debtor
becomes in a state of cessation of payments, or (ii) at the debtors’ request, if the approval of a
safeguard plan is manifestly impossible and if the company would become insolvent should safeguard
proceedings be closed. It is possible for the court-appointed administrator, the mandataire judiciaire or
the public prosecutor to also request the conversion of the safeguard proceedings into reorganization
proceedings where no safeguard plan can realistically be adopted. At any time during safeguard or
reorganization proceedings, the court may convert such proceedings into liquidation proceedings if
recovery of the debtor is manifestly impossible.

If a judicial liquidation of the debtor is commenced, the court will appoint a liquidator. No
maximum time period is provided by law for the duration of the judicial liquidation process. The
liquidator is vested with the power to represent the debtor and perform the liquidation operations
(mainly liquidate the assets and settle the liabilities, to the extent the proceeds from the liquidated
assets are sufficient, in accordance with the creditors’ priority order for payment).

_Creditors’ Committees and Adoption of the Safeguard or Reorganization Plan_

During the observation period, in the case of large companies (with more than 150 employees or
turnover greater than A20 million) whose accounts are certified by a statutory auditor (commissaire aux
_comptes) or established by a certified public accountant (expert comptable), two creditors’ committees_
(one for credit institutions having a claim against the debtor and the other for suppliers having a claim
that represents more than 3% of the total amount of the claims of all the debtor’s suppliers) have to
be established. To be eligible to vote, suppliers must have their claims set forth in the list provided by
the debtor to the administrator as certified by the debtor’s statutory auditor.

If there are any outstanding debt securities in the form of obligations (such as bonds or Notes), a
general meeting gathering all holders of such debt securities will be established whether or not there
are different issuances and regardless of the law applicable to those obligations (the ‘‘bondholders’
general assembly’’). The Notes constitute obligations for the purposes of a safeguard or reorganization
proceeding.

These two committees and the bondholders’ general assembly will be consulted on the safeguard
or reorganization plan drafted by the debtor’s management during the observation period.

Each member of a creditors committee or of the bondholders’ general assembly must, if applicable,
inform the court-appointed administrator of the existence of any agreement relating to (i) the exercise
of its vote or (ii) the full or total payment of its claim by a third party as well as of any subordination

167


-----

agreement. The court-appointed administrator shall then submit to such person a proposal for the
computation of its voting rights in the creditors committee/bondholders’ general assembly. In the event
of disagreement, the matter may be ruled upon by the president of the commercial court in summary
proceedings at the request of the creditor or of the court-appointed administrator.

Creditors whose repayment schedule is not modified by the plan, or for which the plan provides
for a payment of their claims in cash in full as soon as the plan is adopted or as soon as their claims
are admitted, do not need to be consulted on the plan or to take part in the vote.

The plan must be approved by each of the two creditors’ committees. Each committee must vote
on the proposed plan within 20 to 30 days, but no earlier than 15 days, of its proposal by the company.
Such approval requires the affirmative vote of creditors holding at least two-thirds of the amounts of
the claims held by the members of such committee that participated in such vote.

Following the approval of the plan by the two creditors’ committees, the plan will be submitted for
approval to the bondholders’ general meeting. The approval of the plan at such meeting requires the
affirmative vote of bondholders representing at least two-thirds of the amount of the obligations held
by creditors who voted in the bondholders’ general meeting.

Following approval by the creditors’ committees and the bondholders’ general meeting, the plan
has to be approved (arrˆet´e) by the court. In considering such approval, the court has to verify that the
interests of all creditors are sufficiently protected. Where the debtor’s situation has improved and
permits, the plan supervising officer (commissaire `a l’ex´ecution du plan) shall be entitled to request that
the court request amendments to the plan in favor of creditors. Once approved by the relevant court,
the safeguard or reorganization plan accepted by the committees and the bondholders’ general meeting
will be binding on all the members of the committees and all bondholders (including those who voted
against the adoption of the plan). A safeguard or reorganization plan may include debt rescheduling
and debt write-offs as well as debt-to-equity swaps.

In the event any of the committees or the bondholders’ general meeting has refused to give its
consent to the plan, the plan will not be approved by the court and a consultation of the creditors on
an individual basis will take place. This consultation of the creditors on an individual basis also takes
place if creditors’ committees have not been created. In those circumstances, the court has the right to
impose unilateral debt deferrals for a maximum period of 10 years, but the court may not impose debt
write-offs. The same rule applies in respect to creditors who are not members of the committees and
who have not consented to the plan as adopted by the two committees and the bondholders’ general
meeting.

_Accelerated safeguard_

Pursuant to the French reform of pre-insolvency proceedings and insolvency proceedings on
March 12, 2014, a debtor in the course of _conciliation proceedings may request commencement of_
accelerated safeguard proceedings. Accelerated safeguard procedure has been designed based on the
model of the accelerated financial safeguard procedure discussed below, but unlike the accelerated
financial safeguard, it includes non-financial creditors, such as trade creditors.

To be eligible for the accelerated safeguard procedure, the debtor must fulfill the following
conditions:

  - the debtor must be subject to ongoing conciliation proceedings when it applies for the opening
of the accelerated safeguard. In this context, the debtor must have prepared a draft safeguard
plan to protect its operations in the long run which is likely to be supported and to be
adopted by two-thirds of its creditors; and

  - the debtor’s accounts must:

    - be certified by a statutory auditor (commissaire aux comptes) or established by a certified
public accountant (expert comptable), and the debtor must have either (i) more than 20
employees, (ii) a turnover of more than A3 million (excl. VAT), or (iii) a total balance
sheet above A1.5 million; or

    - be consolidated accounts, in accordance with the provisions of article L. 233-16 of the
French Code de commerce.

168


-----

The accelerated safeguard procedure can be opened even if the debtor is in cessation of payments
(cessation des paiements) provided that such cessation of payments did not arise more than 45 days
prior to the date of the application for the conciliation (which is a prerequisite to the accelerated
safeguard).

The debtor must list the claims of each creditor who participated in the conciliation. This list is
certified by (i) the statutory auditor or, where this is not possible, (ii) the accountant of the debtor and
must be filed with the court by the debtor. The filing of the list with the court is considered as a claim
filing on behalf of creditors if they do not declare their claims themselves. Moreover, the creditors’
representative must send to each listed creditor the extract of the list concerning such creditor’s claim.

The maximum duration of the accelerated safeguard procedure (i.e. the period between the
judgment opening the accelerated safeguard and the judgment adopting the plan) is three months.

_Accelerated financial safeguard_

Pursuant to the banking and financial regulation law no. 2010-1249 dated 22 October 2010 (as
amended by the order of 12 March 2014), a debtor in the course of conciliation proceedings may
request commencement of accelerated financial safeguard proceedings. The accelerated financial
safeguard procedure has been designed to ‘‘fast-track’’ purely financial difficulties of large companies
(same thresholds as the accelerated safeguard procedure). The procedure relates only to debt owed to
financial institutions and bondholders (i.e., debts towards credit institutions which are eligible to
creditor’s committees and debts towards bondholders, which are eligible to the bondholders’ general
assembly described above), which are subjected to an automatic stay and dealt with under the
safeguard plan. The company continues to trade normally while the procedure is pending, thus reducing
significantly the impact of a safeguard on operational companies. Other classes of creditors, such as
trade creditors, are not affected by the procedure.

Like the accelerated safeguard discussed above, the Accelerated Financial Safeguard procedure is
available to companies which have failed to agree on a restructuring plan on a unanimous basis in the
context of conciliation proceedings.

To be eligible to the Accelerated Financial Safeguard, the debtor must meet the same conditions as
for an accelerated safeguard procedure, and the accounts of the debtor must also show that the nature
of the debts renders likely the adoption of a plan by financial creditors only.

In general terms, the characteristics listed above in relation to the accelerated safeguard procedure
apply to the accelerated financial safeguard procedure unless otherwise expressly indicated in the
French Code of commerce (such as the duration of the proceedings).

Where accelerated financial safeguard is opened, the credit institution committee and the
bondholders’ general assembly are convened and are required to vote on the proposed safeguard plan
within a minimum period of eight days of delivery of the proposed plan (as compared to a minimum
period of 15 days for the regular safeguard or the accelerated safeguard).

For their claim to be taken into account in the safeguard plan, creditors that are members of the
committee of credit institutions and bondholders must file a proof of claim within two months from the
publication of the judgment opening the proceedings as this is the case for regular safeguard
proceedings. However, if creditor members of the committee of credit institutions and the bondholders’
general assembly do not file their claims within the above- mentioned two-month period, then (i) if
they were party to the conciliation proceeding, their claims will be assumed to have been filed
according to the list of claims established by the debtor and certified by its statutory auditors, which
has to be provided to the court at the opening of the proceedings and (ii) if they were not party to the
_conciliation proceedings, their claim will not be enforceable during the accelerated safeguard_
proceeding and will therefore not be included in the plan.

The total duration of the accelerated financial safeguard (i.e., the period between the judgment
opening the accelerated financial safeguard and the judgment adopting the plan) is one month, unless
the court decides to extend it by one additional month.

169


-----

_Status of Creditors during Safeguard, Accelerated Financial Safeguard, Judicial Reorganization or Judicial_
_Liquidation Proceedings_

Contractual provisions pursuant to which the opening of the proceedings constitutes an event of
default are not enforceable against the debtor, while the court-appointed officer can unilaterally decide
to terminate ongoing contracts (contrats en cours) which it believes the debtor will not be able to
continue to perform. The court-appointed officer can, on the contrary, require that other parties to a
contract continue to perform their obligations even though the debtor may have been in default, but on
the condition that it fully performs its post-petition contractual obligations.

In addition, during the observation period:

  - accrual of interest is suspended (except in respect of loans providing for a term of at least one
year, or contracts providing for a payment which is differed by at least one year—however, in
any event, accrued interest can no longer be compounded);

  - the debtor is prohibited from paying debts contracted prior to the date of the court decision
commencing the proceedings, subject to specified exceptions which essentially cover the set-off
of related (connexes) debts and payments authorized by the bankruptcy judge to recover assets
for which recovery is justified by the continued operation of the business; and

  - creditors may not initiate or pursue any individual legal action against the debtor (or a
guarantor of the debtor provided such guarantor is an individual—except in case of judicial
liquidation) with respect to any claim arising prior to the court decision commencing the
proceedings if the objective of such legal action is:

    - to obtain an order for payment of a sum of money by the debtor to the creditor
(however, the creditor may require that a court determine the amount due);

    - to terminate or cancel a contract for non-payment of amounts owed by the creditor; or

    - to take any action against the debtor, including to enforce the creditor’s rights against any
assets of the debtor.

In accelerated financial safeguard, the above rules only apply to the creditors which are subject to
the accelerated financial safeguard (i.e., credit institutions which are eligible to creditors’ committees
and bondholders, which are eligible to the bondholders’ general assembly described above).

As a general rule, creditors domiciled in France whose debts arose prior to the commencement of
proceedings must file a claim with the creditors’ representative within two months of the publication of
the court decision in the Bulletin Officiel des annonces civiles et commerciales; this period is extended to
four months for creditors domiciled outside France. Creditors who have not submitted their claims
during the relevant period are, except with respect to very limited exceptions, barred from receiving
distributions made in connection with the proceedings. Employees are not subject to claim filing
obligations and are preferential creditors under French law.

If the court adopts a safeguard plan or reorganization plan, claims of creditors included in the plan
will be paid according to the terms of the plan. The court can also set a time period during which the
assets that it deems to be essential to the continued business of the debtor may not be sold without its
consent. The court may also order the sale of the business (plan de cession) where the reorganization
plans presented by the debtor or the creditors are obviously unlikely to allow the reorganization of the
business or in the absence of any such plans (article L. 631-22 of the French Commercial Code (Code
_de commerce))._

If the court adopts a plan for the sale of the business (plan de cession), the proceeds of the sale
will be allocated for the repayment of the creditors according to the ranking of their claims. If the
court decides to order the judicial liquidation of the debtor, the court will appoint a liquidator in
charge of selling the assets of the company and settling the relevant debts in accordance with their
ranking.

French insolvency law assigns priority to the payment of certain preferred creditors, including
employees, officials appointed by the insolvency court, creditors who, as part of the sanctioned
_conciliation agreement, have provided new money or goods or services, post-petition creditors, certain_
secured creditors essentially in the event of liquidation proceedings and the French State (taxes and
social charges).

170


-----

It should be pointed out that under specific circumstances, the law provides for a possibility to
overcome the shareholders’ refusal to increase (and / or decrease) the company’s share capital, in the
framework of reorganization proceedings, but subject to a number of restrictive conditions.

_The ‘‘Hardening Period’’ in Judicial Reorganization and Liquidation Proceedings_

The court determines the date on which the debtor is deemed to have become insolvent. It can be
any date within the 18 months preceding the date of the opening of the proceedings. This marks the
beginning of the ‘‘hardening period’’ (p´eriode suspecte). Certain transactions entered into by the debtor
during the hardening period are automatically void or voidable by the court.

Automatically void transactions include, in particular, transactions or payments entered into during
the suspect period that may constitute voluntary preferences for the benefit of some creditors to the
detriment of other creditors. These include transfers of assets for no, or nominal, consideration,
contracts under which the reciprocal obligations of the debtor significantly exceed those of the other
party, payments of debts not due at the time of payment, payments made in a manner which is not
commonly used in the ordinary course of business and security granted for debts (including a security
granted to secure a guarantee obligation such as the guarantees) previously incurred and provisional
measures, unless the right of attachment or seizure predates the date of cessation of payments.
Pursuant to article L. 632-1 of the French Code de commerce, a notarized declaration of exemption of
assets from seizure (d´eclaration notari´ee d’insaisissabilit´e) made by the debtor is also considered as an
automatically void transaction.

Transactions voidable by the court include payments made on accrued debts, transfers of assets for
consideration and notices of attachments made to third parties (avis `a tiers d´etenteur), seizures (saisie_attribution) and oppositions made during the hardening period, if the court determines that the creditor_
knew of the insolvency of the debtor.

_Creditors’ Liability_

Pursuant to article L. 650-1 of the French Code de commerce, where safeguard, judicial
reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings have been commenced, creditors may be held liable
for the losses suffered as a result of facilities granted to the debtor only if the granting of such facilities
was wrongful and evidence is brought either: (i) that a fraud was committed; or (ii) that there was
interference of the relevant creditor with the management of the debtor; or (iii) that the security or
guarantees taken to support the facilities are disproportionate to such facilities. In addition, any
security or guarantees taken to support facilities in respect of which a creditor is found liable on any of
these grounds can be cancelled or reduced by the court.

**_Rights in the Collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect security interests in the Collateral._**

Under French law, a security interest in certain assets can only be properly perfected, and its
priority retained, through certain actions undertaken by the secured party and/or the grantor of the
security. The liens on the Collateral securing the Notes may not be perfected with respect to the claims
of the Notes if certain actions required to perfect any of these liens are not taken. In particular,
pledges over the securities of French subsidiaries in the form a stock company (soci´et´e par actions) that
are governed by French law consist of pledges over a securities account (compte-titres) in which the
relevant securities are registered. The securities account pledges will be validly established after
execution of a statement of pledge (d´eclaration de nantissement de compte-titres) by each relevant
security provider in favor of the Trustee and/or the Security Trustee and/or the Agents. Each statement
of pledge will have to be registered in the relevant shareholder’s account (compte d’actionnaire) and
shares registry (registre de mouvement de titres) of each French subsidiary the securities of which are
thus pledged. In France, no lien searches are available for security interests which are not publicly
registered, with the result that no assurance can be given on the priority of a security interest if it is
not publicly registered.

**_Limitations on enforcement of security interests and cash amount (‘‘soulte’’)_**

Security interests governed by French law may only secure a creditor up to the secured amount
that is certain, due and unpaid to it. Pledges over securities (whether in the form of a pledge over
securities account or in the form of a pledge over shares (parts sociales)) may generally be enforced at
the option of the secured creditors either (i) by way of a sale of the pledged securities in a public

171


-----

auction (the proceeds of the sale being paid to the secured creditors) or (ii) by means of a court order
by way of judicial foreclosure (attribution judiciaire) or (iii) by way of contractual foreclosure (pacte
_commissoire) of the pledged securities to the secured creditors, following which the secured creditors_
become the legal owner of the pledged securities. If the secured creditors choose to enforce by way of
foreclosure (whether a judicial foreclosure (attribution judiciaire) or contractual foreclosure (pacte
_commissoire)), the secured liabilities would be deemed extinguished up to the value of the foreclosed_
securities. Such value is determined either by a court-appointed expert in the context of a judicial
attribution or by a pre-contractually agreed expert in the context of a contractual foreclosure. If the
value of the Collateral exceeds the amount of secured debt, the secured creditor will be required to pay
the pledgor a cash amount (soulte) equal to the difference between the value of the securities as so
determined and the amount of the secured debt. This is true regardless of the actual amount of
proceeds ultimately received by the secured creditor from a subsequent on-sale of the Collateral.

If the value of such securities is less than the amount of the secured debt, the relevant amount
owed to the relevant creditors will be reduced by an amount equal to the value of such securities, and
consequently the remaining amount owed to such creditors will be unsecured in that respect.

**_Limitations on Enforcement of Guarantees_**

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in a guarantee provided by a company incorporated
under the laws of France (each, a ‘‘French Guarantor’’), such guarantee will be subject to the following
limitations:

  - the obligations and liabilities of a French company under its guarantee will not include any
obligation or liability which, if incurred, would constitute prohibited financial assistance within
the meaning of article L. 225-216 of the French Code de commerce and/or would constitute a
‘‘misuse of corporate assets or powers’’ within the meaning of articles L. 242-6, L. 241-3 or
L. 244-1 of the French Code de commerce and/or would constitute a prohibited guarantee
under article L. 223-11, al. 4 of the French Code de commerce or any other law or regulations
having the same effect, as interpreted by French courts and/or would infringe article L. 511-7
of the French Code mon´etaire et financier; and

  - the obligations and liabilities of a French Guarantor under its guarantee shall only apply to
guarantee (i) the payment obligations of another French Guarantor which is its direct or
indirect subsidiary, or (ii) the payment obligations of any other obligor which is not a
subsidiary of such French Guarantor, in an amount limited, at any time, to the aggregate of all
amounts (if any) directly or indirectly on-lent to such French Guarantor and/or any
subsidiary(ies) of such French Guarantor under intercompany loans or similar arrangements
and outstanding at the date a payment is to be made by such French Guarantor under its
guarantee, it being specified that any payment made by a French Guarantor under this
guarantee shall automatically reduce pro tanto the outstanding amount of the relevant
intercompany loans or similar arrangements due to the parent company by such French
Guarantor or its subsidiary(ies).

In addition, if a French company receives, in return for issuing the guarantee, an economic return
that is less than the economic benefit such French company would obtain in a transaction entered into
on an arm’s-length basis, the difference between the actual economic benefit and that in a comparable
arm’s-length transaction could be taxable under certain circumstances.

_Parallel Debt_

Under French law, certain ‘‘accessory’’ security interests such as pledges require that the pledgee
and the creditor of the claim secured by such security interest be the same person. Such security
interests cannot be held on behalf of third parties who do not hold the secured claim, unless they act
as fiduciary under article 2011 of the French Civil Code or as security agent under article 2328-1 of the
French Civil Code. The beneficial holders of interests in the Notes from time to time will not be
parties to the Security Documents. In order to permit the beneficial holders of the Notes to benefit
from a secured claim, the Intercreditor Agreement will provide for the creation of a ‘‘parallel debt’’.
Pursuant to the parallel debt, the Security Trustee becomes the holder of a claim (the ‘‘Parallel Debt’’)
equal to each amount payable by an Obligor under the Indentures and the Intercreditor Agreement
(the ‘‘Principal Obligations’’). The pledges governed by French law will directly secure the parallel debt,
and may not directly secure the obligations under the Notes and the other indebtedness secured by the

172


-----

Collateral. The Parallel Debt will at all times be in the same amount and payable at the same time as
the Principal Obligations. Any payment in respect of the Principal Obligations shall discharge the
corresponding Parallel Debt and any payment in respect of the Parallel Debt shall discharge the
corresponding Principal Obligations. The pledges governed by French law will directly secure the
Parallel Debt, and may not directly secure the obligations under the Notes and the other indebtedness
secured by the Collateral. The holders of the Notes will not be entitled to take enforcement actions in
respect of such security interests except through the Security Trustee (even if they are in some instances
direct beneficiaries of the security interests in the Collateral).

In France, the highest French judicial court (Cour de cassation), in a decision dated September 13,
2011 (n�10-25533, ‘‘Belv´ed`ere’’ case), recognized the enforceability in France of certain rights (especially
the filing of claims in safeguard proceedings) of a security trustee benefiting from a parallel debt
governed by New York law. In particular, the French Cour de cassation upheld the proof of claim of the
legal holders of a parallel debt claim, considering that it did not contravene French international public
policy (ordre public international) rules. The ruling was made on the basis that the French debtor was
not exposed to double payment or artificial liability as a result of the parallel debt mechanism. The
court was not asked to generally uphold French security interests securing a parallel debt. There is no
assurance that the parallel debt would be recognized in each and every case by French courts or will
meet such courts’ interpretation of the _Cour de cassation decision, and therefore the ability of the_
Security Trustee to enforce the Collateral may be restricted. To the extent that the security interests
created under the parallel debt structure are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the
Notes will not receive any proceeds from an enforcement of the security interest.

The Trustee has certain assigned duties and rights under the Indenture that become particularly
important following Defaults or Events of Default, and acts as trustee in a fiduciary capacity in the best
interests of the holders of the Notes. The concept of ‘‘trust’’ has been recognized by the French Tax
Code and the French supreme court (Cour de cassation), which has held, in the same published
decision referred to above (Cass. com. September 13, 2011 n�10-25533 ‘‘Belv´ed`ere’’ case) that a trustee
validly appointed under a trust governed by the laws of the State of New York could validly be
regarded as a creditor in safeguard proceedings commenced in France. However, while substantial
comfort may be derived from the above, France has not ratified the Hague Convention of July 1, 1985
on the law applicable to trusts and on their recognition, so that the concept of ‘‘trust’’ has not been
generally recognized under French law.

_Fraudulent conveyance_

French law contains specific provisions dealing with fraudulent conveyance both in and outside of
bankruptcy, the so-called action paulienne provisions. The action paulienne offers creditors protection
against a decrease in their means of recovery. A legal act performed by a person (including, without
limitation, an agreement pursuant to which it guarantees the performance of the obligations of a third
party or agrees to provide or provides security for any of its or a third-party’s obligations, enters into
additional agreements benefiting from existing security and any other legal act having similar effect)
can be challenged in or outside bankruptcy of the relevant person by the creditors’ representative
(mandataire judiciaire), the commissioner of the safeguard or recovery plan (commissaire `a l’ex´ecution
_du plan), the liquidator (liquidateur judiciaire) or by any of the creditors of the relevant debtor who was_
prejudiced in his/her means of recovery as a consequence of the act. Any such legal act may be
declared unenforceable against third parties if: (i) the debtor performed such acts without an obligation
to do so; (ii) the creditor concerned or, in the case of the person’s bankruptcy, any creditor, was
prejudiced in its means of recovery as a consequence of the act; and (iii) at the time the legal act was
performed both the debtor and the counterparty to the transaction knew or should have known that
one or more of such debtor’s creditors (existing or future) would be prejudiced in their means of
recovery, unless the act was entered into for no consideration (`a titre gratuit) in which case such
knowledge of the counterparty is not necessary for a successful challenge on grounds of fraudulent
conveyance. If a court found that the issuance of the Notes, the grant of the security interests, or the
granting of a Guarantee involved a fraudulent conveyance that did not qualify for any defense under
applicable law, then the issuance of the Notes, the granting of the security interests, or the granting of
such Guarantee could be declared unenforceable against third parties or declared unenforceable against
the creditor that lodged the claim in relation to the relevant act. As a result of such successful
challenges, holders of the Notes may not enjoy the benefit of the Notes, the Guarantees or the security
interests in the Collateral and the value of any consideration that holders of the Notes received with

173


-----

respect to the Notes, the security interests in the Collateral or the Guarantees could also be subject to
recovery from the holders of the Notes and, possibly, from subsequent transferees. In addition, under
such circumstances, holders of the Notes might be held liable for any damages incurred by prejudiced
creditors of the Issuer or the Guarantors as a result of the fraudulent conveyance.

**Italy**

**_Insolvency_**

In the event of insolvency or financial distress of an entity having its ‘‘center of main interests’’ (as
defined in the EU Insolvency Regulation) in Italy, insolvency, reorganization and debt restructuring
proceedings will be initiated in Italy.

The insolvency laws of Italy may not be as favorable to your interests as creditors in other
jurisdictions with which you may be familiar. In general, Italian creditors’ rights and insolvency laws are
generally considered to be more favorable to debtors and to the trustee in bankruptcy than the regimes
of certain other jurisdictions. In Italy, the courts play a central role in the insolvency process.
Moreover, the enforcement of security interests by creditors in Italy can be time consuming.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of insolvency law in Italy. Certain provisions
of Italian law have been amended or have entered into force only recently and, therefore, may be
subject to further implementation and/or interpretations and have not been tested to date in the Italian
courts. In this respect, the most recent reform has been approved by the Italian Government on
23 June 2015 through a law-decree containing urgent reforms applicable, _inter alia, to Italian_
bankruptcy law (the ‘‘Decree’’). The Decree entered into force on 27 June 2015 (the date of its
publication in the _Gazzetta Ufficiale) and has been converted into law by Law No. 132/2015_
(‘‘Law 132’’). Law 132 entered into force on 21 August 2015 after its publication in the Gazzetta
_Ufficiale._

The two primary aims of Royal Decree No. 267 of March 16, 1942 (the main Italian bankruptcy
legislation), as reformed and currently in force (the ‘‘Italian Bankruptcy Law’’), are to liquidate the
debtor’s assets and protect the goodwill of the going concern (if any) for the satisfaction of creditors’
claims as well as, in case of the ‘‘Prodi-bis’’ procedure or ‘‘Marzano’’ procedure, to maintain
employment. These competing aims have often been balanced by selling businesses as going concerns
and ensuring that employees are transferred along with the businesses being sold. However, the Italian
Bankruptcy Law has been recently amended with a view to promoting rescue procedures rather than
liquidation, and a focus on the continuity and survival of financially distressed businesses and enhancing
pre-bankruptcy restructuring options.

Under the Italian Bankruptcy Law, bankruptcy must be declared by a court, based on the
insolvency (insolvenza) of a company upon a petition filed by the company itself, the public prosecutor
and/or one or more creditors. Insolvency occurs when a debtor is no longer able to regularly meet its
obligations as they become due. This must be a permanent, and not a temporary, status of insolvency in
order for a court to hold that a company is insolvent.

In cases where a company is in distress, it may be possible for it to enter into out-of-court
arrangements with its creditors, which may safeguard the existence of the company, but which are
susceptible to being reviewed by a court in the event of a subsequent insolvency, and possibly
challenged as voidable transactions.

In addition, the following forms of debt restructuring and bankruptcy are available under Italian
law for companies in a state of crisis and for insolvent companies.

**_Out-of-Court Reorganization Plans (piani di risanamento) Pursuant to Article 67, Paragraph 3(d) of the_**
**_Italian Bankruptcy Law_**

Out-of-court debt restructuring agreements are based on restructuring plans (piani di risanamento
_attestati) prepared by companies in order to restructure their indebtedness and to ensure the recovery_
of their financial condition. An independent expert appointed by the debtor has to verify the feasibility
of the restructuring plan and the truthfulness of the business data provided by the company.

The terms and conditions of these plans are freely negotiable. Unlike in-court pre-bankruptcy
agreement proceedings and debt restructuring agreements, out-of-court reorganization plans pursuant
to Article 67, Paragraph 3(d) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law do not offer the debtor any protection

174


-----

against enforcement proceedings and/or precautionary actions of third-party creditors. The Italian
Bankruptcy Law provides that, should these plans fail and the debtor be declared bankrupt, the
payments and/or acts carried out for the implementation of the reorganization plan, subject to certain
conditions (i) are not subject to clawback action and (ii) are exempted from certain potentially
applicable criminal sanctions. Neither ratification by the court nor publication in the companies’
register are needed (although publication in the companies’ register is possible upon a debtor’s request
and would allow for certain tax benefits) and, therefore, the risk of bad publicity or disvalue judgments
are lower than in case of an in-court pre-bankruptcy agreement or a debt restructuring agreement.

**_Debt Restructuring Agreements with Creditors (accordi di ristrutturazione dei debiti) Pursuant to_**
**_Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law_**

Out-of-court agreements for the restructuring of indebtedness entered into with creditors
representing at least 60% of the outstanding company’s debts can be ratified by the court. An expert
appointed by the debtor must assess the truthfulness of the business data provided by the company and
declare that the agreement is feasible and, particularly, that it ensures that the debts of the
non-participating creditors can be fully satisfied within the following time frames: (i) 120 days from the
date of ratification of the agreement by the court, in the case of debts which are due and payable to
the non-participating creditors as at the date of the sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt
restructuring agreement by the court; and (ii) 120 days from the date on which the relevant debts fall
due, in case of receivables which are not yet due and payable to the non-participating creditors as of
the date of the sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement by the court. Only a
debtor who is insolvent or in a state of crisis (i.e., facing distress which does not yet amount to
insolvency) can initiate this process and request the court’s sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt
restructuring agreement entered into with its creditors.

The agreement is published in the companies’ register and is effective as of the day of its
publication. Starting from the date of such publication and for 60 days thereafter, creditors cannot start
or continue any interim relief or enforcement actions over the assets of the debtor and cannot obtain
any security interest (unless agreed) in relation to pre-existing debts. Such moratorium can be
requested, pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 6 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, by the debtor from
the court pending negotiations with creditors (prior to the abovementioned publication of the
agreement), subject to the fulfilment of certain conditions. Such moratorium request must be published
in the companies’ register and becomes effective as of the date of publication. The court, having
verified the completeness of the documentation, sets the date for a hearing within 30 days of the
publication and orders the company to supply the relevant documentation in relation to the
moratorium to the creditors. In such hearing, the court assesses whether the conditions for granting the
moratorium are in place and, if they are, orders that no interim relief or enforcement action may be
started or continued, nor can security interests (unless agreed) be acquired over the assets of the
debtor, and sets a deadline (not exceeding 60 days) within which the restructuring agreement has to be
filed. The court’s order may be challenged within 15 days of its publication. Within the same time
frame, an application for the _concordato preventivo (as described below) may be filed, without prejudice_
to the effect of the moratorium.

The Italian Bankruptcy Law does not expressly provide for any indications concerning the contents
of the debt restructuring agreement. The plan can therefore provide, inter alia, either for the
prosecution of the business by the debtor or by a third party, or the sale of the business to a third
party and may contain, refinancing agreements, moratoria, write-offs and/or postponements of claims.
The debt restructuring agreement may also contain a proposed tax settlement for the partial or
deferred payment of certain taxes.

Creditors and other interested parties may oppose the agreement within 30 days from the
publication of the agreement in the companies’ register. The court will, after having settled the
oppositions (if any), validate the agreement by issuing a decree, which may be appealed within 15 days
of its publication.

Pursuant to the new Article 182-quinquies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, the court, pending the
sanctioning (omologazione) of the agreement pursuant to Article 182-bis, paragraph 1, or after the filing
of the instance pursuant to Article 182-bis, paragraph 6, or a petition for a concordato preventivo, also
pursuant to Article 161, paragraph 6, may authorize the debtor (i) to incur in new indebtedness
pre-deductible pursuant to Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, provided that the expert

175


-----

appointed by the debtor, having verified the overall financial needs of the company until the
sanctioning (omologazione), declares the aim of the new financial indebtedness results in a better
satisfaction of the creditors, and (ii) to pay debts deriving from the supply of services or goods, already
payable and due, provided that the expert declares that such payment is essential for the keeping of
company’s activities and to ensure the best satisfaction for all creditors.

Furthermore, Law 132 introduced a new paragraph to Article 182 quinquies which provides that
debtors can apply—without the need of an expert’s certification—to the court to seek urgent court
authorization to enter into ‘‘interim financing’’ agreements pre-deductible pursuant to Article 111 of
the Italian Bankruptcy Law and also to continue to use existing ‘‘linee di credito autoliquidanti’’ (trade
receivables credit lines). To that end, the new financings and credit lines must be functional to meet
urgent needs of the business’ activities and the debtor’s application must state what use will be made of
the new financings. In addition, the debtor must state that it is otherwise unable to obtain alternative
financing and that, without these new financings, the business would suffer an imminent and
irremediable prejudice. Further to the debtor’s application, the court must decide within the following
ten days, after having heard (if considered necessary) the opinion of the main creditors.

**_The ‘‘new’’ debt restructuring agreement with banks and financial intermediaries under Article 182-septies of_**
**_the Italian Bankruptcy Law_**

Law 132 has introduced a specific type of debt restructuring agreement for businesses whose debts
are predominantly (at least 50% of the total amount) owed to banks and financial intermediaries.
Other creditors’ (not banks or financial intermediaries) rights remain unaffected and debts to such
creditors must be paid in full. Essentially, a specific regime has been established that means that even
financial creditors who, although entitled to participate in negotiations, have chosen not to take part in
the agreement, can be bound by the contents of a restructuring agreement, thus overcoming the need
for unanimity requested by credit institutions in negotiations of financial manoeuvres. The purpose is to
prevent banks with modest credits from effectively having the power to block restructuring operations
involving more exposed bank creditors, resulting in the failure of the overall restructuring and the
opening of a procedure. Financial creditors who did not participate in the agreement may oppose to it
(within 30 days of receipt of the application).

**_Court-Supervised Pre-Bankruptcy Composition with Creditors (concordato preventivo)_**

A company which is insolvent or in a situation of crisis, but has not been declared insolvent by the
court, has the option to make a composition proposal to its creditors, under court supervision, in order
to compose its overall indebtedness and/or reorganize its business, thereby avoiding a declaration of
insolvency and the initiation of bankruptcy proceedings. Such composition proposal can be made by a
commercial enterprise which exceeds any of the following thresholds: (i) has had assets (attivo
_patrimoniale) in an aggregate amount exceeding A0.3 million for each of the three preceding fiscal_
years, (ii) gross revenues (ricavi lordi) in an aggregate amount exceeding A0.2 million for each of the
three preceding fiscal years, and (iii) has total indebtedness in excess of A0.5 million. Only the debtor
company can file a petition with the court for a _concordato preventivo (together with, inter alia, the_
proposed agreement and an independent expert report assessing the feasibility of the composition
proposal and the truthfulness of the business data provided by the company).

As amended by Law 132, a concordato preventivo proposal must now provide for the repayment of
at least 20% of unsecured credits, although such limit does not apply if the concordato proposal relates
to a ‘‘concordato with business continuity’’ (concordato con continuit`a aziendale) and, therefore, is
applicable only when the _concordato is of liquidatory nature. Law 132 extends the timing requested for_
the homologation of _concordato preventivo procedures, which shall occur within 9 months from the_
filing of the request by the company.

The petition for concordato preventivo is then published by the debtor in the companies’ register.
From the date of such publication to the date on which the court sanctions the concordato preventivo,
all enforcement and interim relief actions by the creditors (whose debt became due before the
sanctioning of the concordato preventivo by the court) are stayed. During this time, all enforcement,
precautionary actions and interim measures sought by the creditors, whose title arose beforehand, are
stayed. Pre-existing creditors cannot obtain security interests (unless authorized by the court) and
mortgages registered within the 90 days preceding the date on which the petition for the concordato
_preventivo is published in the companies’ register are ineffective against such pre-existing creditors._

176


-----

The composition proposal filed in connection with the petition may provide for: (i) the
restructuring of debts and the satisfaction of creditors’ claims (including through extraordinary
transactions, such as the granting to creditors and to their subsidiaries or affiliated companies of shares,
bonds (including bonds convertible into shares), or other financial instruments and debt securities);
(ii) the transfer to a receiver (assuntore) of the operations of the debtor company making the
composition proposal (iii) the division of creditors into classes and (iv) different treatment of creditors
belonging to different classes. The composition proposal may also contain a proposed tax settlement for
the partial or deferred payment of certain taxes.

The filing of the petition for the _concordato preventivo may be preceded by the filing of a_
preliminary petition for a concordato preventivo (so-called concordato in bianco, pursuant to Article 161,
paragraph 6, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law). The debtor company may file such petition along with
(i) its financial statements from the latest three financial years and, pursuant to the recent Italian Law
Decree No. 69/2013 as converted into law No. 98/2013 (‘‘Law Decree 69/2013’’), (ii) the list of creditors
with the reference to the amount of their respective receivables, reserving the right to submit the
underlying plan, the proposal and all relevant documentation within a period assigned by the court
between 60 and 120 days from the date of the filing of the preliminary petition, subject to only one
possible further extension of up to 60 days, where there are reasonable grounds for such extension. In
advance of such deadline, the debtor may also file a petition for the approval of a debt restructuring
agreement (pursuant to Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law). Pursuant to Law Decree
69/2013, the court, if it accepts such preliminary petition, may (i) appoint a judicial commissioner
(commissario giudiziale) to overview the company, who, in the event that the debtor has carried out one
of the activities under Article 173 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law (e.g. concealment of part of assets,
omission to report one or more claims, declaration of non-existent liabilities or commission of other
fraudulent acts), shall report it to the court, which, upon further verification, may reject the petition at
court for a _concordato preventivo and (ii) set forth reporting and information duties of the company_
during the above mentioned period.

The debtor company may not file such pre-application if it had already done so in the previous
two years without having followed by the admission to the concordato preventivo. The decree setting the
term for the presentation of the documentation contains also the periodical information requirements
(relating also to the financial management of the company and to the activities carried out for the
purposes of the filing of the application and the restructuring plan) that the company has to fulfill, at
least on a monthly basis, until the lapse of the term established by the court. The debtor company shall
file, on a monthly basis, the company’s financial position, which is published, the following day, in the
companies’ register. Non-compliance with these requirements results in the application for the
composition with creditors being declared inadmissible and, upon request of the creditors or the public
prosecutor and provided that the relevant requirements are verified, in the adjudication of the
distressed company into bankruptcy. If the activities carried out by the debtor company appear to be
clearly inappropriate to the preparation of the application and the restructuring plan, the court may, ex
_officio, after hearing the debtor and—if appointed—the judicial commissioner, reduce the time for the_
filing of additional documents.

Following the filing of the preliminary petition and until the decree of admission to the
composition with creditors, the distressed company may (i) carry out acts pertaining to its ordinary
activity and (ii) seek the court’s authorization to carry out acts pertaining to its extraordinary activity,
to the extent they are urgent. Claims arising from acts lawfully carried out by the distressed company
are treated as super senior (so-called prededucibili) pursuant to Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy
Law and the related acts, payments and security interests granted are exempted from the clawback
action provided under Article 67 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law. Law No. 9/2014 specified that the
super-seniority of the claims—which arise out of loans granted with a view to allowing the filing of the
preliminary petition for the composition with creditors (domanda di pre-concordato)—is granted,
pursuant to Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, conditional upon the proposal, the plan and all
other required documents being filed within the term set by the court and the company being admitted
to the concordato preventivo within the same proceeding opened with the filing of the preliminary
petition.

The composition proposal may propose that (i) the debtor’s company’s business continues to be
run by the debtor’s company as a going concern, or (ii) the business is transferred to one or more
companies and any assets which are no longer necessary to run the business are liquidated (concordato
_con continuit`a aziendale). In these cases, the petition for the concordato preventivo should fully describe_

177


-----

the costs and revenues which are expected as a consequence of the continuation of the business as a
going concern, as well as the financial resources and support which will be necessary. The report of the
independent expert shall also certify that the continuation of the business is conducive to the
satisfaction of creditors’ claims to a greater extent than if such composition proposal was not
implemented.

Furthermore, the going concern-based arrangements with creditors can provide for, inter alia, the
winding-up of those assets which are not functional to the business allowed. The composition
agreement may also contain a proposed tax settlement for the partial or deferred payment of certain
taxes.

If the court determines that the composition proposal is admissible, it appoints a judge (giudice
_delegato) to supervise the procedure, appoints one or more judicial officers (commissari giudiziali) and_
calls a creditors’ meeting. During the implementation of the proposal, the company generally continues
to be managed by its board of directors, but is supervised by the appointed judicial officers and judge
(who shall authorize all transactions that exceed the ordinary course of business).

The concordato preventivo is voted on at a creditors’ meeting and must be approved by the
favorable vote of: (a) the creditors representing the majority of the receivables admitted to vote and, in
the event that the plan provides for more classes of creditors also, (b) the majority of the classes.
Creditors who have not voted will be deemed to approve the concordato preventivo proposal if they fail
to notify their objection via telegraph, fax, mail or e-mail to such proposal within 20 days from the
closure of the minutes of that creditors’ meeting. Secured creditors are not entitled to vote on the
proposal of _concordato preventivo unless and to the extent they waive their security, or the concordato_
_preventivo provides that they will not receive full satisfaction of the fair market value of their secured_
assets (such value being assessed by an independent expert), in which case they can vote only in respect
of the part of their debt affected by the proposal. The court may also approve the concordato preventivo
(notwithstanding the circumstance that one or more classes objected to it) if (i) the majority of classes
has approved it, and (ii) the court deems that the interests of the dissenting creditors would be
adequately safeguarded through it compared to other solutions. If an opposition is filed by 20% of the
creditors or, in case there are different classes of creditors, by a creditor belonging to a dissenting class,
entitled to vote, by the court may nonetheless approve the concordato preventivo if it deems that the
relevant creditor’s claim is likely to be satisfied no less than would otherwise be the case.

In the context of a _concordato preventivo Law 132 introduces new provisions with the aim of having_
a more effective restructuring even through the direct involvement of creditors. This amendment
includes an offer to transfer the business or any going concern or specific assets, and with respect to
which the commissioner believes the offer is not in the best interest of the creditors, there is now the
possibility to open a competitive auction and to present competing bids (offerte concorrenti). Moreover,
creditors representing at least ten percent of the debt may present alternative creditors’ composition
proposals to those of the debtor (proposte concorrenti), if the debtor’s proposal does not provide for
payment of at least 40% (or 30% in relation to composition with creditors with the continuity of the
going concern under Article 186-b is of the Italian Bankruptcy Law) of the unsecured receivables and
such payment threshold is certified by the report issued by an independent expert in relation to the
debtor’s proposal.

After the approval by the creditors’ meeting, the court (having settled possible objections raised by
the dissenting creditors, if any) confirms the concordato preventivo proposal by issuing a confirmation
order.

If the creditors’ meeting does not approve the concordato preventivo, the court may, upon request
of the public prosecutor or a creditor, and having decided that the appropriate conditions apply,
declare the company bankrupt.

_Bankruptcy (fallimento)_

A request to declare a debtor company bankrupt and to commence bankruptcy proceedings
(fallimento) and the judicial liquidation of the debtor company’s assets can be filed by the debtor
company itself, any of its creditors and, in certain cases, by the public prosecutor. The bankruptcy is
declared by the competent bankruptcy court. The Italian Bankruptcy Law is applicable only to
commercial enterprises (imprenditori commerciali) if any of the following thresholds are met (i.e., the
company has had assets (attivo patrimoniale) in an aggregate amount exceeding A0.3 million for each of

178


-----

the three preceding fiscal years, gross revenues (ricavi lordi) in an aggregate amount exceeding
A0.2 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years and has total indebtedness in excess of
A0.5 million). On the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings:

  - subject to certain exceptions, all actions of creditors are stayed and creditors must file claims
within a defined period. In particular, under certain circumstances secured creditors may
enforce against the secured property as soon as their claims are admitted as preferred claims.
Secured claims are paid out of the proceeds of the secured assets, together with interest and
expenses. Any outstanding balance will be considered unsecured and rank pari passu with all
of the bankrupt’s other unsecured debt. The secured creditor may sell the secured asset only
after it has obtained authorization from the designated judge (giudice delegato). After hearing
the bankruptcy receiver and the creditors’ committee, the designated judge decides whether to
authorize the sale, and sets forth the timing in its decision;

  - the administration of the debtor company and the management of its assets pass from the
debtor company to the bankruptcy receiver (curatore fallimentare);

  - any act of the debtor company done after a declaration of bankruptcy (including payments
made) is ineffective against the creditors;

  - continuation of business may be authorized by the court if an interruption would cause greater
damage to the company, but only if the continuation of the company’s business does not cause
damage to creditors; and

  - the execution of certain contracts and/or transactions pending as of the date of the bankruptcy
declaration are suspended until the receiver decides whether to take them over. Although the
general rule is that the bankruptcy receiver is allowed to either continue or terminate
contracts where some or all of the obligations have not been performed by both parties,
certain contracts are subject to specific rules expressly provided for by the Italian Bankruptcy
Law.

The bankruptcy proceedings are carried out and supervised by a court-appointed bankruptcy
receiver, a deputy judge (giudice delegato) and a creditors’ committee. The bankruptcy receiver is not a
representative of any one of the creditors, but is responsible for the liquidation of the assets of the
debtor for the satisfaction of the creditors as a whole. The proceeds from the liquidation are
distributed in accordance with statutory priority. The liquidation of a debtor can take a considerable
amount of time, particularly in cases where the debtor’s assets include real property. In this respect,
Law 132 amended the relevant provision of the Italian Bankruptcy Law which sets forth the requisite
applicable to the liquidation procedure, which means that, the timing for the liquidation of a debtor
may be shortened. The Italian Bankruptcy Law provides for a priority of payment to certain
preferential creditors, including employees, the Italian treasury, and judicial and social authorities. Such
priority of payment is provided under mandatory provisions of Italian law (and, as a consequence, it is
untested and it is unlikely that priority of payments such as those commonly provided in intercreditor
contractual arrangements would be recognized by an Italian bankruptcy estate to the extent they are
inconsistent with the priorities provided by applicable law).

_Bankruptcy Composition with Creditors (concordato fallimentare)_

A bankruptcy proceeding can terminate prior to liquidation through a bankruptcy composition
proposal with creditors. The proposal can be filed, by one or more creditors or third parties, from the
declaration of bankruptcy. By contrast, the debtor or its subsidiaries are only permitted to file such
proposal after one year following such declaration, but within two years following the decree giving
effectiveness to the liabilities account (stato passivo). Secured creditors are not entitled to vote on the
proposal of _concordato fallimentare, unless and to the extent they waive their security or the concordato_
_fallimentare provides that they will not receive full satisfaction of the fair market value of their secured_
assets (such value being assessed by an independent expert), in which case they can vote only in respect
of the part of their debt affected by the proposal.

The proposal may provide for the division of creditors into classes (thereby proposing different
treatment among the classes), the restructuring of debts and the satisfaction of creditors’ claims in any
manner. The concordato fallimentare proposal must be approved by the creditors’ committee and the
creditors holding the majority (by value) of claims (and, if classes are formed, also by a majority (by
value) of the claims in a majority of the classes). Final court ratification is also required.

_Statutory Priorities_

The statutory priority given to creditors under the Italian Bankruptcy Law may be different from
that established in the United States, the United Kingdom and certain other EU jurisdictions. Neither
the debtor nor the court can deviate from the rules of statutory priority by proposing their own
priorities of claims or by subordinating one claim to another based on equitable subordination
principles (as a consequence it must be noted that priority of payments such as those commonly
provided in intercreditor contractual arrangements may not be enforceable against an Italian
bankruptcy estate to the extent they are inconsistent with the priorities provided by law). The rules of
statutory priority apply irrespective of whether the proceeds are derived from the sale of the entire
bankrupt’s estate or part thereof, or from a single asset.

Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law establishes that proceeds of liquidation shall be
allocated according to the following order: (i) for payments of ‘‘pre-deductible’’ claims (i.e., claims
originated in the insolvency proceeding, such as costs related to the procedure); (ii) for payment of
claims which are privileged, such as claims of secured creditors; and (iii) for the payment of unsecured
creditors’ claims. Under Italian law, the highest priority claims (after the costs of the proceedings are
paid) are the claims of preferential creditors including, inter alia, a claim whose priority is legally
acquired (i.e., repayment of rescue or interim financing, mentioned above), the claims of the Italian tax
authorities and social security administrators, and claims for employee wages. The remaining priority
claims are those of ‘‘privileged’’ creditors (creditori privilegiati; a priority in payment in most
circumstances, but not exclusively, provided for by law), mortgagees (creditori ipotecari), pledgees
(creditori prignoratizi) and unsecured creditors (crediti chirografari).

_Avoidance Powers in Insolvency_

Under Italian law, there are ‘‘clawback’’ or avoidance provisions that may lead to, inter alia, the
revocation of payments made or security interests granted by the debtor prior to the declaration of
bankruptcy. The key avoidance provisions include, but are not limited to, transactions made below
market value, preferential transactions and transactions made with a view to defraud creditors.
Clawback rules under Italian law are normally considered to be particularly favorable to the receiver in
bankruptcy, compared to the rules applicable in other jurisdictions.

In bankruptcy proceedings, depending on the circumstances, the Italian Bankruptcy Law provides
for a clawback period of up to either one year or six months in certain circumstances (please note that
in the context of extraordinary administration procedures—see below—in relation to certain
transactions the clawback period can be extended to five and three years, respectively) and a two-year
ineffectiveness period for certain other transactions.

The Italian Bankruptcy Law distinguishes between acts or transactions which are ineffective by
operation of law and acts or transactions which are voidable at the request of the bankruptcy receiver/
court commissioner, as detailed below.

a) _Acts ineffective by operation of law_

i. Under Article 64 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, all transactions entered into for no
consideration are ineffective vis- `a-vis creditors if entered into by the debtor in the
two-year period prior to the insolvency declaration; and

ii. under Article 65 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, payments of debts falling due on the day
of the declaration of insolvency or thereafter are deemed ineffective vis-`a-vis creditors if
made by the debtor in the two-year period prior to the insolvency declaration.

b) _Acts which could be declared ineffective at the request of the bankruptcy receiver/court_
_commissioner_

i. The following acts and transactions, if done or made during the period specified below,
may be clawed back (revocati) vis-`a-vis the bankruptcy as provided for by article 67 of the
above referenced Royal Decree and be declared ineffective unless the other party proves
that it had no actual or constructive knowledge of the debtor’s insolvency:

I. the onerous transactions entered into in the year preceding the insolvency
declaration, where the value of the debt or of the obligations undertaken by the

180


-----

debtor exceeds by 25% the value of the consideration received by and/or promised to
the debtor;

II. payments of debts, due and payable, made by the debtor, which were not paid in
cash or by other customary means of payment in the year preceding the insolvency
declaration;

III. pledges and mortgages granted by the bankrupt entity in the year preceding the
insolvency declaration in order to secure pre-existing debts which have not yet fallen
due; and

IV. pledges and mortgages, granted by the bankrupt entity in the six months preceding
the insolvency declaration, in order to secure debts which had fallen due.

ii. The following acts and transactions, if done or made during the period specified below,
may be clawed back (revocati) and declared ineffective if the bankruptcy receiver proves
that the other party knew that the bankrupt entity was insolvent at the time of the act or
transaction:

I. the payments of debts that are immediately due and payable and any onerous
transactions entered into or made in the six months preceding the insolvency
declaration; and

II. the granting of security interests securing debts (even those of third parties) and
made in the six months preceding the insolvency declaration.

iii. The following transactions are exempt from clawback actions:

I. a payment for goods or services made in the ordinary course of business and in
accordance with market practice;

II. a remittance on a bank account, provided that it does not reduce the bankrupt
entity’s debt towards the bank in a material and lasting manner;

III. a sale, including an agreement for sale registered pursuant to Article 2645-bis of the
Italian Civil Code, currently in force, made for a fair value and concerning a
residential property that is intended as the main residence of the purchaser or the
purchaser’s family (within three degrees of kinship) or a nonresidential property that
is intended as the main seat of the enterprise of the purchaser, on the condition that,
as at the date of the insolvency declaration, such activity is actually exercised or the
investments for the start of such activity have been carried out;

IV. transactions entered into, payments made and security interests granted with respect
to the bankrupt entity’s goods, provided that they concern the implementation of a
_piano di risanamento attestato (see ‘‘—Out-Of-Court Reorganization Plans (Piani di_
_risanamento) Pursuant to Article 67, Paragraph 3(d) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law’’_
above);

V. a transaction entered into, payment made or security interest granted to implement a
_concordato preventivo (see Court-Supervised Pre-bankruptcy Composition with_
Creditors (concordato preventivo)) or an _accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti under_
Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law (see Debt Restructuring Agreements
with Creditors (accordi di ristrutturazione dei debiti) and transactions entered into,
payments made and security interests granted after the filing of the application for a
_concordato preventivo (see above);_

VI. remuneration payments to the bankrupt entity’s employees and consultants; and

VII. a payment of a debt that is immediately due, payable and made on the due date,
with respect to services necessary for access to concordato preventivo procedures.

In addition, in certain cases, the bankruptcy receiver can request that certain transactions of the
bankrupt entity be declared without effect vis-`a-vis the acting creditors within the Italian Civil Code
ordinary clawback period of five years (revocatoria ordinaria). Under Article 2901 of the Italian Civil
Code, a creditor may demand that transactions through which the bankrupt entity disposed of its assets
to the detriment of such creditor’s rights be declared ineffective with respect to such creditor, provided

181


-----

that the bankrupt entity was aware of such detriment (or, if the transaction was entered into prior to
the date on which the creditor’s claim originated, that such transaction was fraudulently entered into by
the debtor in order to cause detriment of such creditor’s rights) and that, in the case of a transaction
entered into for consideration with a third person, the third person was aware of such detriment (or, if
the transaction was entered into prior to the date on which the creditor’s claim originated, such third
party participated in the fraudulent scheme).

Law 132 also introduced new article 2929 bis to Italian Civil Code, providing for a ‘‘simplified’’
claw back action for the creditor in respect of certain type of transactions put in place by the debtor
with the aim to subtract (registered) assets from the attachment by its creditors.

In particular, the creditor can now start enforcement proceedings over the relevant assets without
previously obtaining a court decision clawing back/nullifying the relevant (fraudulent) transaction,
to the extent that such transaction had been carried out for no consideration (e.g. gratuitous
transfers, or creation of shield instruments such as trusts or the so-called fondo patrimoniale—
‘‘family trust’’). In case of gratuitous transfers, the enforcement action can be carried out by the
creditor also against the third party purchaser.

_Extraordinary Administration for Large Insolvent Companies (amministrazione straordinaria delle grandi_
_imprese in stato di insolvenza)_

An extraordinary administration procedure applies under Italian law for large industrial and
commercial enterprises (the Prodi-bis procedure). The relevant company must be insolvent, but
demonstrating serious recovery prospects. To qualify for this procedure, the company must have
employed at least 200 employees in the previous year. In addition, it must have debts equal to at least
two-thirds of its assets as shown in its financial statements and two-thirds of its income from sales and
services during its last financial year. Either of the creditors, the debtor, a court or the public
prosecutor may make a petition to commence an extraordinary administration procedure. The same
rules set forth for bankruptcy proceedings with respect to existing contracts and creditors’ claims largely
apply to extraordinary administration proceedings.

There are two main phases—a ‘‘judicial phase’’ and an ‘‘administrative phase.’’

_Judicial Phase_

In the judicial phase, the court determines whether the company meets the admission criteria and
whether it is insolvent. It then issues a decision to that effect and appoints up to three judicial receivers
(commissiario giudiziale) to investigate whether the company has serious prospects for recovery via a
business sale or reorganization. The judicial receiver files a report with the court within 30 days, and
within 10 days from such filing, the Italian Productive Activities Minister (the ‘‘Ministry’’) may make an
opinion on the admission of the company to the extraordinary administration procedure. The court
then decides (within 30 days from the filing of the report) whether to admit the company to the
procedure or to place it into bankruptcy.

_Administrative Phase_

Assuming that the company is admitted to the extraordinary administration procedure, the
administrative phase begins and an extraordinary commissioner (or commissioners) is appointed by the
Ministry. The extraordinary commissioner(s), prepares a plan which can provide for either the sale of
the business as a going concern within one year (unless extended by the Ministry) (the ‘‘Disposal
Plan’’) or a reorganization leading to the company’s economic and financial recovery within two years
(unless extended by the Ministry) (the ‘‘Recovery Plan’’). The plan may also include an arrangement
with creditors (e.g., a debt for equity swap, an issue of shares in a new company to whom the assets of
the company have been transferred, etc.) (concordato). The plan must be approved by the Ministry
within 30 days from submission by the extraordinary commissioner.

In addition, the extraordinary commissioner draws up a report every six months on the financial
condition and interim management of the company and sends it to the Ministry.

The procedure ends upon successful completion of either a Disposal Plan or a Recovery Plan,
failing which the company is declared bankrupt.

182


-----

_Industrial Restructuring of Large Insolvent Companies (ristrutturazione industriale di grandi imprese in stato_
_di insolvenza)_

Introduced in 2003, the industrial restructuring of large insolvent companies is also known as the
‘‘Marzano’’ procedure. It is complementary to the Prodi-bis procedure and, except as otherwise
provided, the same provisions apply. The Marzano procedure is intended to be faster than the Prodi-bis
procedure. For example, although a company must be insolvent, the application to the Ministry is made
together with the filing to the court for the declaration of the insolvency of the debtor.

The Marzano procedure only applies to large insolvent companies which, on a consolidated basis,
have at least 500 employees in the year before the procedure is commenced and at least A300.0 million
of debt. The decision whether to open a Marzano procedure is taken by the Ministry following the
debtor’s request (who must also file an application for the declaration of insolvency). The Ministry
assesses whether the relevant requirements are met and then appoints the extraordinary
commissioner(s) who will manage the company. The court also decides on the company’s insolvency.

The extraordinary commissioner(s) has/have 180 days (or 270 days if the Ministry so agrees) to
submit a Disposal Plan or Recovery Plan. The restructuring through the Disposal Plan or the Recovery
Plan must be completed within, respectively, one year (extendable to two years) and two years. If no
Disposal or Recovery Plan is approved by the Ministry, the court will declare the company bankrupt
and open bankruptcy proceedings.

_Compulsory Administrative Winding-Up (liquidazione coatta amministrativa)_

A compulsory administrative winding-up (liquidazione coatta amministrativa) is only available for
certain companies, including, inter alia, public interest entities such as state-controlled companies,
insurance companies, credit institutions and other financial institutions, none of which can be made
subject to bankruptcy proceedings. It is irrelevant whether these companies belong to the public or the
private sector. A compulsory administrative winding-up is a special sort of insolvency proceeding in
which the entity is liquidated not by the bankruptcy court, but by the relevant administrative authority
that oversees the industry in which the entity is active. The procedure may be triggered not only by the
insolvency of the relevant entity, but also on other grounds expressly provided for by the relevant legal
provisions (e.g., in respect of Italian banks, serious irregularities concerning the management of the
bank or serious violations of the applicable legal, administrative or statutory provisions). The effect of
this procedure is that the entity loses control over its assets and a liquidator (commissario liquidatore) is
appointed to wind up the company. The liquidator’s actions are monitored by a steering committee
(comitato di sorveglianza). The powers assigned to the designated judge and the bankruptcy court under
the other insolvency proceedings are assumed by the relevant administrative authority under this
procedure. The effect on creditors of the forced administrative winding-up is largely the same as under
bankruptcy proceedings and includes, for example, a ban on enforcement measures. The same rules set
forth for bankruptcy proceedings with respect to existing contracts and creditors’ claims largely apply to
extraordinary administration proceedings.

**_Certain Italian Law Considerations in Relation to Guarantees and Security Interests and Certain Other_**
**_Additional Italian Legal Considerations_**

_Corporate Benefit and Financial Assistance Issues under Italian Law_

Under Italian law, the entry into of a transaction (including the creation of a security interest or
the granting of a guarantee) by a company must be permitted by the applicable laws and by its by-laws
(statuto sociale) and is subject to compliance with the rules on corporate benefit and corporate
authorization. If a security interest or a guarantee is being provided in the context of an acquisition,
group reorganization, refinancing or restructuring, financial assistance issues may also be triggered.

_Corporate Benefit_

An Italian company entering into a transaction (including granting a security interest or a
guarantee) must receive a real and adequate benefit in exchange for it. The concept of a real and
adequate benefit is not specifically defined in the applicable legislation and is determined by a factual
analysis on a case-by-case basis. As a general rule, corporate benefit is to be assessed at the level of the
relevant company on a stand-alone basis, although upon certain circumstances and subject to specific
rules the interest of the group to which such company belongs may also be taken into consideration.

183


-----

As a general rule, absence of a real and adequate corporate benefit could render the transaction
(including granting a security interest or a guarantee) ultra vires and potentially affected by conflict of
interest and the related corporate resolutions adopted by the shareholders and directors may be the
subject matter of challenges and annulment. Civil liabilities also may be imposed on the directors of the
company if it is assessed that they did not act in the interest of it and that the acts they carried out do
not fall within the corporate purpose of the company or were against mandatory provisions of Italian
law. The lack of corporate benefit could also lead to civil liabilities on those companies or persons
ultimately exercising control over the Italian grantor or having knowingly received an advantage or
profit from such improper control. Moreover, the transaction (including the security interest or
guarantee granted by an Italian company) could be declared null and void if the lack of corporate
benefit was known or presumed to be known by the third party and such third party acted intentionally
against the interest of the company.

The above principles on corporate benefit apply equally to upstream/crossstream/downstream
security interest or guarantees granted by Italian companies.

In relation to security interests or guarantees, while corporate benefit for a downstream security or
guarantee (i.e., a security or a guarantee granted to secure financial obligations of direct or indirect
subsidiaries of the relevant grantor) can usually be easily proved, the validity and effectiveness of an
upstream or cross-stream security or guarantee (i.e., a security interest or a guarantee granted to secure
financial obligations of the direct or indirect parent or sister companies of the relevant grantor) granted
by an entity organized under the laws of Italy depend on the existence of a real and adequate benefit
in exchange for the granted security interest or guarantee. The general rule is that the risk assumed by
an Italian grantor of security or guarantee must not be disproportionate to the direct or indirect
economic benefit to it. In particular, in case of upstream and crossstream security interests or
guarantees for the financial obligations of group companies, examples may include financial
consideration in the form of access to cash flows through intercompany loans from other members of
that group or other economic benefit accruing to the Italian grantor in the context of the overall
transaction.

_Financial Assistance_

Save for specific exceptions, it is unlawful under Italian laws for a company to give financial
assistance (whether by means of loans, security, guarantees or otherwise) to support the acquisition or
subscription by a third party of its own shares or quotas or those of any entity that (directly or
indirectly) controls the Italian company, and any loan, guarantee or security given or granted in breach
of these provisions is null and void. Financial assistance to refinance indebtedness incurred by a
company to purchase or subscribe for its own shares or quotes or those of its direct or indirect parent
company might also be considered as falling within the scope of Italian financial assistance provisions.

Subject to the foregoing, the Guarantees by any Italian Guarantor are subject to certain
restrictions or limitations, including, inter alia:

  - the Guarantees will not secure any amounts the purpose of which is, directly or indirectly, the
acquisition or the subscription in any shares in such Italian Guarantor and/or any of its direct
and indirect holding companies in the context of the acquisition, in accordance with the
provisions of article 2358 and/ or article 2474, as the case may be, of the Italian Civil Code;

  - the Guarantees will be in any case limited to, and will not exceed, the amount of any
intercompany loans, or other financial support in any form, advanced to such Italian
Guarantor (or any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries pursuant to article 2359, paragraph 1,
numbers 1 and/or 2, of the Italian Civil Code) by any member of the Group on or after the
Issue Date using the proceeds of, respectively, the Floating Rate Senior Secured Notes and
the Secured Notes; and

  - the Guarantees will be limited to a specific maximum amount, pursuant to article 1938 of the
Italian Civil Code.

_Certain Limitations on Enforcement_

Under Italian law, in the event that an entity becomes subject to insolvency proceedings,
guarantees and security interests given by it or by way of a parallel debt obligation could be subject to
potential challenges by the appointed bankruptcy receiver or by other creditors under the rules of

184


-----

ineffectiveness or avoidance or clawback of Italian Bankruptcy Law and the relevant law on the
non-insolvency avoidance or clawback of transactions made by the debtor during a certain legally
specified period (the ‘‘suspect period’’). For a more detailed explanation of the terms, conditions and
consequences of clawback actions in an insolvency scenario, see ‘‘—Certain Italian Insolvency Laws’’
above.

If challenged successfully, the guarantee or the security interest may become unenforceable and
any amounts received must be refunded to the insolvent estate. To the extent that the grant of any
security interest or guarantee is voided, holders of the Notes could lose the benefit of the security
interest or guarantee and may not be able to recover any amounts under the related security
documents.

In addition, under Italian law, in certain circumstances also in the ordinary course of business, an
action can be brought by any creditor of a given debtor within five years from the date in which the
latter enters into a guarantee, security, agreement and any other act by which it disposes of any of its
assets, in order to seek a clawback action (azione revocatoria ordinaria) pursuant to Article 2901 of the
Italian Civil Code (which results in a declaration of ineffectiveness as to the acting creditor) of the said
guarantee, security, agreement and other act that is purported to be prejudicial to the acting creditor’s
right of credit. An Italian court could revoke the said guarantee, security, agreement and other act only
if it, in addition to the ascertainment of the prejudice, was to make the two following findings:

  - that the debtor was aware of the prejudice which the act would cause to the rights of the
acting creditor, or, if such act was done prior to the existence of the claim or credit, that the
act was fraudulently for the purpose of prejudicing the satisfaction of the claim or credit;

  - that, in the case of non-gratuitous act, the third party involved was aware of said prejudice
and, if that act was done prior to the existence of the claim or credit, that the said third party
participated in the fraudulent design.

Furthermore, under fraudulent conveyance and other provisions of Italian law, a court could void
or invalidate all or a portion of the obligations of a guarantor under the relevant guarantee and, if
payment had already been made under that guarantee, require the recipients of that payment to return
the payment to the relevant guarantor, if the court found that, inter alia:

  - the relevant guarantor gave such guarantee with actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud its
current or future creditors or with a desire to prefer some creditors over others, or when the
beneficiary of the guarantee was aware that the relevant guarantor was insolvent when it gave
the relevant guarantee;

  - the relevant guarantor did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value for its
guarantee or the relevant guarantor was insolvent at the time the guarantee was given;

  - the relevant guarantee was held to exceed the corporate objects of the relevant guarantor or
not to be in the best interest or for the corporate benefit of the relevant guarantor; or

  - the guarantor giving such guarantee was aware, or should have been aware, that the
transaction was to the detriment of the creditors.

If a court decided either that a guarantee was a fraudulent conveyance and voided such guarantee,
or held it unenforceable for any other reason, the beneficiary of the guarantee may cease to have any
claim with respect to the relevant guarantor. The same would also apply to any security interest.

**_Certain Considerations in Relation to Security Interests_**

_Parallel Debt_

It is uncertain and untested in the Italian courts whether, under Italian law, a security interest can
be created and perfected: (i) in favor of creditors (such as the holders of the Notes) which are neither
directly parties to the relevant security documents or are not specifically identified therein or in the
relevant share certificates and corporate documents or public registries; and (ii) in favor of a ‘‘trustee’’,
since there is no established concept of ‘‘trust’’ or ‘‘trustee’’ under Italian law and the precise nature,
effect and enforceability of the duties, rights and powers of a ‘‘trustee’’ as agent or trustee under
security interests granted over Italian assets is uncertain under Italian law.

185


-----

Given the above and considering that the holders of the Notes are not party to the Italian law
governed security documents, there is a risk that an Italian court may determine that the holders of the
Notes (in relation to which the relevant perfection formalities acknowledging their status as a secured
creditor are not perfected at the time of enforcement) are not secured by the security interests created
under the Italian law governed security documents and/or cannot enforce that security interest.

To address the above potential issue, the Intercreditor Agreement provides for the creation of a
‘‘parallel debt’’. Pursuant to the parallel debt claim and subject to the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement and to applicable law, the Security Agent, in its individual capacity acting in its own name
and not as agent or representative of the holders of the Notes, shall become the holder of a claim
equal to each amount payable by an obligor under the Notes. The security interests in the Notes
Collateral governed by Italian law will then secure the parallel debt. However, investors should note
that the enforceability of Italian law governed security interests granted in favor of the creditor of a
parallel debt has not been tested before the Italian courts and, therefore, it cannot be excluded that the
parallel debt will not per se eliminate or mitigate the risk of unenforceability by the holders of the
Notes of the Notes Collateral securing the Notes governed by Italian law.

General

The procedures for the enforcement of Italian law security and the timing for obtaining judicial
decisions (including in relation to security enforcement) in the Republic of Italy are materially complex
and time-consuming, especially given that the Italian courts maintain a significant role in the
enforcement process, in comparison to other jurisdictions with which investors may be familiar.

**Luxembourg**

**_Insolvency_**

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of insolvency law in Luxembourg. As
described above, in the event that Lecta S.A. or Sub Lecta S.A. experiences financial difficulty, it is not
possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings
would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings.

Pursuant to Luxembourg insolvency laws, your ability to receive payment under the Notes may be
more limited than would be the case under U.S. bankruptcy laws. Under Luxembourg law, the
following types of proceedings (together referred to as ‘‘insolvency proceedings’’) may be initiated
against a company having its ‘‘centre of main interests’’ (within the meaning of EU Council Regulation
No. 1346/2000 of May 29, 2000 on insolvency proceedings (the ‘‘EUIR’’)) or an establishment in
Luxembourg (in the latter case assuming that the centre of main interests is located in a jurisdiction
where the EUIR is applicable):

  - bankruptcy proceedings (faillite), the opening of which may be requested by the company, by
any of its creditors or by the courts ex officio. Following such a request, the Luxembourg
courts having jurisdiction may open bankruptcy proceedings if the company: (i) is in a state of
cessation of payments (cessation des paiements) and (ii) has lost its commercial
creditworthiness (´ebranlement de cr´edit). The main effect of such proceedings is the sale of the
assets and allocation of the proceeds of such sale between creditors taking into account their
rank of privilege, as well as the suspension of all measures of enforcement against the
company, except, subject to certain limited exceptions, for enforcement by secured creditors
and the payment of the secured creditors in accordance with their rank upon realization of the
assets. In addition, the managers or directors of a Luxembourg company that ceases its
payments (i.e., is unable to pay its debts as they fall due with normal means of payment) must
within a month of them having become aware of the company’s cessation of payments, file a
petition for bankruptcy (faillite) with the court clerk of the district court of the company’s
registered office. If the managers or directors fail to comply with such provision they may be
held (i) liable towards the company or any third parties on the basis of principles of directors’
liability for any loss suffered and (ii) criminally liable for simple bankruptcy (banqueroute
_simple) in accordance with article 573 of the Luxembourg Commercial Code._

  - controlled management proceedings (gestion contrˆol´ee), the opening of which may only be
requested by the company and not by its creditors and under which a Luxembourg court may

186


-----

order the provisional stay of enforcement of claims except for secured creditors (please see
the below applicable provision of the law as of August 5, 2005); or

  - composition proceedings (concordat pr´eventif de faillite), the opening of which may only be
requested by the company (subject to obtaining the consent of the majority of its creditors)
and not by its creditors directly. The Luxembourg court’s decision to admit a company to
composition proceedings triggers a provisional stay on enforcement of claims by creditors
except for secured creditors (see the below applicable provisions of the law as of August 5,
2005).

  - In addition to these proceedings, your ability to receive payment on the Notes may be affected
by a decision of a Luxembourg court to grant a stay on payments (sursis de paiement) or to
put a Luxembourg company into judicial liquidation (liquidation judiciaire). Judicial liquidation
proceedings may be opened at the request of the public prosecutor against companies
pursuing an activity violating criminal laws or that are in serious breach or violation of the
Luxembourg Commercial Code or of the Luxembourg laws applicable to commercial
companies, as amended. The management of such liquidation proceedings will generally follow
similar rules as those applicable to Luxembourg bankruptcy proceedings.

Liability of the Luxembourg companies in respect of the Notes will, in the event of a liquidation of
the company following bankruptcy or judicial liquidation proceedings, only rank after the cost of
liquidation (including any debt incurred for the purpose of such liquidation) and any claims that are
preferred under Luxembourg law. Preferential claims under Luxembourg law include, among others:

  - remuneration owed to employees (last six months’ wages amounting to a maximum of six
times the minimum social salary);

  - employees’ contributions to social security;

  - amounts owed to the Luxembourg Revenue (including direct and indirect taxes);

  - the employer’s contribution to social security;

  - landlord, pledgor not under the Financial Collateral Law (as defined herein); and

  - unsecured creditors.

Assets over which a security interest has been granted will in principle not be available for
distribution to unsecured and unpreferred creditors (except after enforcement and to the extent a
surplus is realized).

More-favorable rules apply in relation to security interests of claims or financial instruments
securing monetary claims (or claims for the delivery of financial instruments). In such a case, the act
dated August 5, 2005 concerning financial collateral arrangements, as amended (the ‘‘Financial
Collateral Law’’) applies. Article 20 of the Financial Collateral Law provides that all Luxembourg law
collateral arrangements (pledges, security assignments and repo agreements) over claims and financial
instruments, as well as all enforcement measures and valuation and enforcement measures agreed upon
by the parties in accordance with this law, are valid and enforceable even if entered into during the
preference period (periode suspecte) against third parties, commissioners, receivers, liquidators and
other similar persons notwithstanding the insolvency proceedings (save in the case of fraud).

Article 24 of the Financial Collateral Law provides that foreign law security interests over claims
or financial instruments granted by a Luxembourg pledgor will be valid and enforceable as a matter of
Luxembourg law notwithstanding any Luxembourg insolvency proceedings, if such foreign law security
interests are similar in nature to a Luxembourg security interest falling within the scope of the
Financial Collateral Law. If article 24 applies, Luxembourg preference period rules are disapplied (save
the case of fraud).

Article 21(2) of the Financial Collateral Law provides that where a financial collateral arrangement
has been entered into on the day of, but after the opening of liquidation proceedings or the coming
into force of reorganization measures or the entry into force of such measures, such arrangement is
enforceable against third parties, administrators, insolvency receivers, liquidators and other similar
persons if the collateral taker proves that it was unaware of the fact that such proceedings had been
opened or that such measures had been taken or that it could not reasonably be aware of such
proceedings, measures or arrangement.

187


-----

_Impact of Insolvency Proceedings on Transactions_

During such insolvency proceedings, all enforcement measures by unsecured creditors are
suspended. Other than as described above, the ability of certain secured creditors to enforce their
security interests may also be limited, particularly in the event of controlled management proceedings
expressly providing that the rights of secured creditors will be frozen until a final decision has been
taken by a Luxembourg court as to the petition for controlled management, and may be affected
thereafter by a reorganization order given by the court. A reorganization order requires the prior
approval by more than 50% of the creditors representing more than 50% of the relevant Luxembourg
company’s liabilities in order to take effect.

Furthermore, you should note that declarations of default and subsequent acceleration (such as
acceleration upon the occurrence of an event of default) may not be enforceable during controlled
management proceedings.

Luxembourg insolvency laws may also affect transactions entered into or payments made by a
Luxembourg company during the preference period (p´eriode suspecte) which is a maximum of six
months plus 10 days preceding the judgment declaring bankruptcy, except that in certain specific
situations the court may set the start of the suspect period at an earlier date. In particular:

  - pursuant to article 445 of the Luxembourg Code of Commerce (Code de commerce), specified
transactions (including the granting of a security interest for antecedent debts save in respect
of financial collateral arrangements within the meaning of the Financial Collateral Law; the
payment of debts which have not fallen due, whether payment is made in cash or by way of
assignment, sale, set-off or by any other means; the payment of debts which have fallen due by
any means other than in cash or by bill of exchange; and the sale of assets without
consideration or with substantially inadequate consideration) entered into during the
preference period (or the 10 days preceding it) must be set aside or declared null and void, if
so requested by the insolvency receiver;

  - pursuant to article 446 of the Luxembourg Code of Commerce, payments made for matured
debts as well as other transactions concluded for consideration during the preference period
are subject to cancellation by the court upon proceedings instituted by the insolvency receiver
if they were concluded with the knowledge of the bankrupt party’s cessation of payments; and

  - pursuant to article 448 of the Luxembourg Code of Commerce and article 1167 of the Civil
Code (action paulienne), the insolvency receiver (acting on behalf of the creditors) has the
right to challenge any fraudulent payments and transactions, including the granting of security
with an intent to defraud, made prior to the bankruptcy, without any time limit.

In principle, a bankruptcy order rendered by a Luxembourg court does not result in the automatic
termination of contracts except for employment agreements and powers of attorney. The contracts,
therefore, subsist after the bankruptcy order. However, the bankruptcy receiver may choose to
terminate certain contracts so as to avoid worsening the financial situation of the company. As of the
date of adjudication of bankruptcy, no interest on any unsecured claim will accrue vis-`a-vis the
bankruptcy estate. Insolvency proceedings may hence have a material adverse effect on the relevant
Luxembourg company’s business and assets and the Luxembourg company’s respective obligations
under the Notes.

Finally, international aspects of Luxembourg bankruptcy, controlled management or composition
proceedings may be subject to the EUIR. In particular, rights in rem over assets located in another
jurisdiction where the EUIR is applicable, will not be affected by the opening of insolvency
proceedings, without prejudice, however, to the applicability of rules relating to the voidness, voidability
or unenforceability of legal acts detrimental to all the creditors (subject to the application of article 24
of the Financial Collateral Law as described above and article 13 of the EUIR).

Under Luxembourg law, the following types of proceedings (together referred to as ‘‘insolvency
proceedings’’) may be opened against an entity having its registered office or ‘‘centre of main interests’’
in Luxembourg:

  - bankruptcy proceedings (faillite), the opening of which may be requested by the company or
by any of its creditors. Following such a request, the court having jurisdiction may open
bankruptcy proceedings if the company (i) is in a state of cessation of payments (cessation des
paiements) and cumulatively (ii) has lost its commercial creditworthiness. If a court finds that

188


-----

these conditions are satisfied, it may also open bankruptcy proceedings ex officio (absent a
request made by the company or a creditor). The main effect of such proceedings is the
suspension of all measures of enforcement against the company, except, subject to certain
limited exceptions, only for secured creditors and the payment of the creditors in accordance
with their rank upon realization of the assets;

  - controlled management proceedings (gestion contrˆol´ee), the opening of which may only be
requested by the company and not by its creditors;

  - composition proceedings (concordat pr´eventif de faillite), which may be requested only by the
company and not by its creditors. The court’s decision to admit a company to composition
proceedings triggers a provisional stay on enforcement of claims by creditors;

  - stay on payments (sursis de paiements) or to put the Issuer into judicial liquidation (liquidation
_judiciaire). Judicial liquidation proceedings may be opened at the request of the public_
prosecutor against companies pursuing an activity violating criminal laws or that are in serious
breach or violation of the Luxembourg Commercial Code or of the Luxembourg laws
applicable to commercial companies. The management of such liquidation proceedings will
generally follow the rules of bankruptcy proceedings.

The Issuer’s liabilities in respect of the Notes will, in the event of a liquidation of the Issuer
following bankruptcy or judicial liquidation proceedings, only rank after the cost of liquidation
(including any debt incurred for the purpose of such liquidation) and those of the Issuer’s debts that
are entitled to priority under Luxembourg law. Preferential debts under Luxembourg law include,
among others:

  - remuneration owed to employees (last six months’ wages amounting to a maximum of six
times the minimum social salary);

  - employees’ contributions to social security;

  - amounts owed to the Luxembourg Revenue (including direct and indirect taxes);

  - the employer’s contribution to social security;

  - landlord, pledgor not under the Financial Collateral Law (as defined herein); and

  - unsecured creditors.

Assets over which a security interest has been granted will in principle not be available for
distribution to unsecured creditors (except after enforcement and to the extent a surplus is realized).

During such insolvency proceedings, all enforcement measures by unsecured creditors are
suspended. The ability of secured creditors to enforce their security interests may also be limited
(particularly in the event of controlled management proceedings providing expressly that the rights of
secured creditors will be frozen until a final decision has been taken by the court as to the petition for
controlled management) and may be affected thereafter by any reorganization order given by the court.

Furthermore, declarations of default and subsequent acceleration (such as acceleration upon the
occurrence of an event of default) are not enforceable during controlled management proceedings.

Luxembourg insolvency laws may affect transactions entered into or payments made by the Issuer
during the period before any liquidation or administration. If the liquidator or administrator can
demonstrate that a payment was made during the ‘‘preference period’’ (which is a maximum of six
months and 10 days preceding the judgment declaring bankruptcy) that is disadvantageous to the estate
of creditors and the party receiving such payment is shown to have known that the bankrupt party had
generally stopped making payments when such payment occurred, a Luxembourg court has the power,
among other things, to void the preferential transaction.

If the liquidator or administrator can demonstrate that the Issuer has given ‘‘preference’’ to any
person by defrauding the rights of creditors generally, regardless of when this fraud occurred, a
Luxembourg court has the power, among other things, to void the preferential transaction.

Finally, any international aspects of Luxembourg bankruptcy, controlled management and
composition proceedings may be subject to the EU Insolvency Law. See ‘‘—European Union—
Insolvency.’’

**_Limitation on Enforcement of Guarantees and Security Interests_**

_Guarantees_

Sub Lecta S.A. will guarantee certain obligations under the Notes.

Luxembourg law dated August 10, 1915 on commercial companies, as amended, does not provide
for rules governing the ability of a Luxembourg company to guarantee the indebtedness of another
entity of the same group. It is generally held that within a group of companies, the corporate interest
of each individual corporate entity should, to a certain extent, be tempered by and subordinated to the
interest of the group. A reciprocal assistance from one group company to another does not necessarily
conflict with the interest of the assisting company. However, this assistance must be justified by a group
policy, be in proportion with the real financial means of the assisting company (which in relation to
upstream or cross-stream guarantees may be addressed by guarantee limitations) and have a reciprocal
character. A guarantee not satisfying these criteria would expose its de facto or de jure directors or
managers to personal liability or criminal liability. In addition, the guarantee or security interest could
itself be held unenforceable. The Guarantee granted by Sub Lecta S.A. will be limited to a certain
percentage of, among other things, the company’s net worth (capitaux propres).

The granting of the Guarantee or of the security interests also needs to be part of the corporate
object of Sub Lecta S.A.

_Security Interests_

Assets over which a valid security right has been granted will in principle not be available for
distribution to unsecured creditors (except after enforcement and to the extent a surplus is realized).
Under Article 20 of the Luxembourg Act dated August 5, 2005 on financial collateral arrangements, as
amended (the ‘‘Collateral Act’’), all collateral arrangements in respect of assets over which Luxembourg
security rights have been granted, as well as all enforcement measures and valuation and enforcement
measures agreed upon by the parties in accordance with the Collateral Act, are valid and enforceable
against third parties, insolvency receivers, liquidators and other similar persons notwithstanding the
insolvency proceedings and even if entered into during the pre-bankruptcy period (p´eriode suspecte) (in
all cases except in case of fraud).

Security rights granted by Sub Lecta S.A. that are governed by a law other than Luxembourg law
are subject to Article 24 of the Collateral Act, which provides that a foreign law security right granted
by a Luxembourg grantor will be valid and enforceable as a matter of Luxembourg law notwithstanding
any Luxembourg insolvency proceedings, if such foreign law security right is similar in nature to a
Luxembourg financial collateral arrangement falling within the scope of the Collateral Act (i.e., a
pledge or transfer of title by way of security covering financial instruments and/or monetary claims).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a foreign security that is not of a similar legal nature to a Luxembourg
security right, where it covers collateral located in a Member State (other than Luxembourg) of the
European Union party to the EU Insolvency Regulation will not be affected by Luxembourg insolvency
proceedings.

**Spain**

**_Insolvency_**

Under the current Spanish Insolvency Law, a debtor is considered insolvent when it cannot
possibly comply with its due obligations on a regular basis (the so-called ‘‘current insolvency’’
(insolvencia actual) or when it expects that it will shortly be unable to do so (the so-called ‘‘imminent
insolvency’’ (insolvencia inminente). The debtor must seek the court’s assistance in order to be declared
bankrupt within two months as of the date the debtor knew or should have been aware of its
insolvency. A creditor may also apply for a debtor’s insolvency if it can prove to the court: (i) a general
failure on the part of the debtor to meet its payment obligations; (ii) the existence of attachments on
the debtor’s assets that will generally affect its business; (iii) a general liquidation by the debtor of its
assets in certain circumstances; or (iv) a general failure on the part of the debtor to comply with tax,
social security, salary and other employment obligations during the three-month period preceding the
insolvency filing. If filed by the debtor, the insolvency is deemed ‘‘voluntary’’ (concurso voluntario) and,
if filed by a third party, the insolvency is deemed ‘‘mandatory’’ (concurso necesario). In the case of
voluntary insolvency, as a general rule, the debtor retains the management and full powers of disposal
over its assets, although it is subject to the intervention (intervenci´on) of the insolvency administrators.

190


-----

In the case of mandatory insolvency, as a general rule, the debtor’s management powers are suspended,
and management’s former power, including the power to dispose of assets, is conferred solely upon the
insolvency administrators.

There is no clawback date by operation of law. Therefore, there are no prior transactions that
automatically become void as a result of the initiation of insolvency proceedings but instead the
insolvency administrators must expressly challenge those transactions. Under the current Spanish
Insolvency Law, upon a declaration of insolvency, acts detrimental (perjudiciales) to the debtor’s estate
carried out during the two years prior to the date the insolvency is declared may be rescinded,
regardless of fraudulent intention. Article 71 contains an irrefutable presumption that those acts where
no consideration is received for a disposed asset and acts which result in the early repayment of
obligations which would have become due after the declaration of insolvency (unless such obligations
were guaranteed by means of an in rem security) are detrimental. In addition, unless the debtor or
another affected party (such as a creditor) can prove otherwise to the court’s satisfaction, a disposal
made in favor of a related person or entity (as defined in the Spanish Insolvency Law) as well as the
creation of a security interest securing a preexisting obligation or a new obligation that replaces an
existing one, and those payments or other acts extinguishing obligations which would have become due
after the declaration of insolvency and which are guaranteed by means of an in rem security, are
presumed to be detrimental. In the case of actions not covered by the presumptions above, the burden
of proof is on the person bringing the action of rescission. Acts deriving from the debtor’s ordinary
course of business made at arm’s length and some kinds of refinancing arrangements meeting certain
legal requirements set forth in Article 71 bis may not be rescinded (as explained below).

Accordingly, a Guarantor’s acts of disposal with a ‘‘related person or entity,’’ as defined in the
Spanish Insolvency Law (such as the Issuer), are presumed to be detrimental unless proved otherwise.
Also, the general principle of ‘‘no termination effect’’ is established such that all agreements remain
effective at the time of the insolvency.

Creditors may join more than one set of insolvency proceedings together, or apply for a joint
insolvency order for various entities if the debtor belongs to a group of companies with joint decisionmaking powers and joint assets. In any event, and particularly in joint insolvency proceedings, set-off is
prohibited unless the requirements for the set-off were satisfied prior to the declaration of insolvency
or the set-off provisions are pursuant to an agreement subject to a law that permits set-off.

The current Spanish Insolvency Law also makes a distinction between general debts (cr´editos
_concursales) under insolvency proceedings and debts against the insolvency estate (cr´editos contra la_
_masa). Debts against the insolvency estate, such as certain amounts of the employee payroll and the_
costs and expenses of the insolvency proceedings, and 50% of the funds lent under a refinancing
arrangement entered into in compliance with the requirements set forth in Article 71 bis, are not
considered part of the debtor’s general debt and are paid before other debts under insolvency
proceedings and at their respective maturities (as this will be further explained).

The Spanish Insolvency Law provides that insolvency proceedings conclude following either the
implementation of an agreement between the creditors and the debtor (the ‘‘Company Voluntary
Agreement’’ or the ‘‘CVA’’) or the liquidation of the debtor.

Creditors are required to report their claims to the insolvency administrators within one month
from the last official publication of the court order declaring the insolvency, providing a copy of the
documentation that justifies such claims though the insolvency administrator can ask for the original
one. Based on the documentation provided by the creditors and documentation held by the debtor, the
insolvency administrator draws up a list of acknowledged creditors/claims and classifies them according
to the categories established in the Spanish Insolvency Law:

  - Creditors benefiting from special privileges, representing security on certain assets (in rem
sureties). Nevertheless the amount of the special privileged credit will reach the value of the
guarantee calculated according to the formula fixed by law. These privileges may entail
separate proceedings, although subject to certain restrictions derived from a waiting period
that may last up to one year. Secured creditors are bound by the CVA if they have voted in
favor of it, and though they might not have voted in favor, they will also be enforced by the
CVA if certain creditor majorities are met (labor, public, financial or the others). In the event
of liquidation, they are the first to collect payment against the assets on which they are

191


-----

secured. However, the insolvency administrator has the option to halt any enforcement of the
securities and pay these claims as administrative expenses under specific payment rules.

  - Creditors benefiting from a general privilege, including, among other things, specific labor
claims and specific claims brought by public entities or authorities, which are recognized for
half their amount, and claims held by the creditor taking the initiative to apply for the
insolvency proceedings, for up to 50% of the amount of such debt and the funds lent under a
refinancing arrangement entered into in compliance with the requirements set forth in
Article 71 bis (in the amount not admitted as a debt against the insolvency estate). Secured
creditor are bound by the CVA if they have voted in favor of it, and though they might not
have voted in favor, they will also be enforced by the CVA if certain creditors majorities are
met (labor, public, financial or the others) and, in the event of liquidation, they are the first
collecting payment, in accordance with the ranking established under the Spanish Insolvency
Law.

  - Ordinary creditors (non-subordinated and non-privileged claims), such as ordinary commercial
suppliers, will be paid once the privileged credits have been paid and pro rata temporis. This is
a residual category.

  - Subordinated creditors (so classified by virtue of an agreement or pursuant to law), include,
among others, credits communicated late (outside the specific one-month period mentioned
above); credits which are contractually subordinated vis-`a-vis all other credits of the debtor;
credits relating to surcharge and unpaid interest claims (including default interest) except for
those credits secured with an in rem right up to the secured amount; fines; and loans or
similar transactions granted by those creditors which are ‘‘specially related parties’’ to the
insolvent debtor.

Other claims are not subject to the insolvency proceedings and are therefore neither acknowledged
nor classified. These include any claims accrued after the insolvency proceedings (e.g., those entered
into in order to continue the business) as well as other claims prescribed by law, even if accrued earlier
(i.e., salaries accrued during the last 30 days before the insolvency proceedings are initiated or new
money lent within the context of protected refinancing agreements: 50% if lent after October 2016,
100% if lent before 2016). These claims are immediately payable (cr´editos contra la masa), although the
Spanish Insolvency Law imposes some restrictions on their enforceability.

In the case of a legal entity, the following shall be deemed to be ‘‘specially related parties’’:
(i) shareholders with unlimited liability; (ii) limited liability shareholders holding 10% or more of the
insolvent company’s share capital (or 5% if the company is listed); (iii) directors and those holding
general powers of attorney from the insolvent company and those who have held the said posts in the
two years immediately preceding the declaration of insolvency; and (iv) companies pertaining to the
same group as the debtor and their common shareholders, provided such shareholders meet the
minimum shareholding requirements set forth in (ii) above.

Subordinated creditors do not have the right to vote at the creditors’ meeting (whereby the CVA is
approved or rejected) and they are not paid until ordinary credits are not fully satisfied.

As a general rule, insolvency proceedings are not compatible with other enforcement proceedings.
When compatible, in order to protect the interests of the debtor and creditors, the Spanish Insolvency
Law extends the jurisdiction of the court dealing with insolvency proceedings, which is then legally
authorized to handle any enforcement proceedings or interim measures affecting the debtor’s assets
(whether based upon civil, labor or administrative law).

**_Pre-insolvency moratorium (section 5 bis of the Spanish Insolvency Law)_**

The debtor is allowed to obtain an additional four-month moratorium upon application to the
court, in order to allow the discussion of an advanced proposal for arrangement or a refinancing
agreement. The debtor would have to file the application for the declaration of insolvency within the
four-month period if it has not reached a restructuring agreement that resolves its insolvency issues.

Court and out-of-court enforcement actions against assets which are necessary to enable the
business to continue cannot be pursued by creditors from the time an application for a moratorium is
filed with the court. Insolvency filing by creditors would also not be allowed. Creditors involved in a
scheme of arrangement would also not be allowed to enforce (against any assets) if at least 51% of the

192


-----

financial creditors have agreed not to do so while the scheme was being negotiated. Apart from that,
business would continue as usual after the filing of the application under section 5 bis the Spanish
Insolvency Law.

The debtor will not be entitled to apply for any further moratorium within a year of the last
moratorium being granted.

The amendments to the Spanish Insolvency Law introduced in 2009, 2011 and 2014 by the Spanish
legislator aimed to reduce the risk of claw-back under certain circumstances, thus facilitating certain
refinancing agreements between financial entities and companies in distress.

The refinancing agreement will avoid the risk of being subject to a claw-back action if certain
conditions are met (Article 71 bis of the Spanish Insolvency Law):

  - The refinancing agreement is deemed to be a transaction providing for:

    - a ‘‘significant’’ increase of the available funds, or

    - a novation or write-off of the existing obligations (as a result either of the extension of
the term, or the establishment of obligations to replace the existing ones).

  - Requirements to be met by such refinancing agreements in order to be outside of the
claw-back regime are the following:

    - Formalities: the agreement must be executed in a public instrument enclosing all of the
documents that justify the fulfilment of the requirements set out below.

    - Creditors’ approval: the agreement must be signed by creditors representing at least three
fifths of the debtor’s liabilities (including non-financial liabilities, e.g., trade creditors) at
the date of the adoption of the refinancing agreement. In cases where refinancing
agreements affect a group of companies, this majority needs to be achieved at an
individual company level and at a consolidated group level, (intercompany debts are
excluded for voting purposes). For the purpose of calculating these majorities, in case of
syndicated loans, the approval by 75% of the syndicated creditors (or less if agreed in the
syndicated facilities) will be binding for 100% of the syndicated debt.

    - Viability: the agreement must be supported by a viability plan that confirms the debtor’s
ability to continue the business in the short and medium term.

    - Certificate of auditors: the agreement must include a certificate issued by the auditors of
the debtor confirming that the required majority has been duly calculated.

Agreements that do not meet the requirements mentioned above will also be protected if the
following conditions are all met: (i) they entail the reduction of the proportion between liabilities and
assets; i.e. write-off; (ii) the resulting current assets exceed the resulting short term liabilities; (iii) the
resulting securities do not guarantee more than 90% of the resulting liabilities, nor do they entail an
increase of the percentage of liabilities secured prior to the agreement; (iv) the resulting interest rate
does not exceed in more than 1/3 the former interest rate; and (v) the agreement is executed in a
public instrument and includes a detailed explanation of the transaction.

_Extended binding effects of the protected refinancing agreements_

If judicially sanctioned, certain refinancing agreements will be, not only protected from future
claw-back actions (51% majority of financial liabilities would be enough for this purpose), but also will
cram down financial creditors who have dissented.

Dissenting unsecured financial creditors, or secured financial creditors with exposures that exceed
the value of their security, will be bound by judicially sanctioned agreements as follows:

  - If the agreement has been approved by 60% of the financial liabilities of the debtor, the
aforementioned creditors will be bound by any debt extensions for up to 5 years and by any
agreed conversion of debt into Profit Participating Loans (‘‘PPLs’’) with a term of less than
5 years.

  - If the agreement has been approved by 75% of the financial liabilities of the debtor, the
aforementioned creditors will be bound by any debt extensions agreed for up to 10 years,

193


-----

write-offs and any agreed conversion of debt into PPL up to 10 years, debt to equity swaps
and payments in kind of the loans.

Dissenting secured financial creditors will be bound by judicially sanctioned refinancing agreements
for the amounts covered by the security as follows:

  - If the agreement has been approved by 65% of the financial liabilities of the debtor, the
aforementioned creditors will be bound by an extension of the debt for up to 5 years and by
any agreed conversion of debt into PPL also with a term not exceeding 5 years.

  - If the agreement has been approved by 80% of the financial liabilities of the debtor, the
aforementioned creditors will be bound by an extension of the debt up to 10 years, write-offs
and any agreed conversion of debt into PPL for up to 10 years, debt to equity swaps and
payments in kind of the loans.

For this purpose, the security value will be 90% of the reasonable value of the asset (as defined in
the Spanish Insolvency Law) after deducting other liabilities that are preferentially secured by the same
asset.

For the calculation of the aforementioned majorities the following should be taken into account:

  - Financial liabilities will include any financial claims excluding public, commercial claims and
connected party claims.

  - In case of syndicated loans, the approval by 75% of the syndicated creditors (or less if agreed
so in the syndicating facilities) will entail the approving vote of 100% of the debt.

The protected refinancing agreements are subject to the approval of an insolvency judge. By means
of an expedited proceeding, the judge will verify that the above requirements have been met.

Once approved, any affected creditors may file a challenge by way of incidental proceedings, only
if they find that the majorities have not been properly calculated or if the refinancing agreement
represents a disproportionate sacrifice for the affected creditors.

_New money lending_

Amendments of 2014 have introduced two preferences for new money, in order to facilitate the
obtaining of financing by companies with financial difficulties:

  - Financing granted in the context of refinancing in accordance with Article 71 bis of the
Spanish Insolvency Law will be split into a claim against the insolvency estate and a claim
enjoying a general priority, in the event of subsequent insolvency proceedings.

  - Financing in the context of an agreement will be made against the insolvency estate if
liquidation arises later (unless it was granted by a connected party).

The amendment of 2014 has enhanced this regime, by providing that until October 2, 2016
financing granted in the context of refinancing in accordance with 71 bis of the Spanish Insolvency Law
will be considered a claim against the insolvency estate, even if it was granted by a connected party.

_Applicable Jurisdiction_

The applicable jurisdiction to conduct an insolvency proceeding is the one in which the insolvent
party has its ‘‘centre of main interests.’’ This center is deemed to be where the insolvent party conducts
the administration of its interests on a regular basis and which is recognized as such by third parties.
Insolvency proceedings conducted by the court with jurisdiction over the ‘‘centre of main interests’’ are
considered to be the ‘‘principal insolvency proceedings’’ and have universal reach affecting all the assets
of the insolvent party worldwide. If the ‘‘centre of main interests’’ is not in Spain, but the insolvent
party has a permanent establishment in Spain, Spanish courts will only have jurisdiction over the assets
located in Spain (the ‘‘territorial insolvency proceedings’’).

In the event Spanish courts have jurisdiction (upon a judicial consideration that the Issuer’s
‘‘centre of main interests’’ is in Spain), Article 87.6 of the current Spanish Insolvency Law would apply
to the Issuer. Article 87.6 provides that creditors holding a third-party guarantee will be recognized in
the insolvency proceeding in their full amount without any limitation and without prejudice to the
subrogation of the guarantor in the creditor’s place, if the guarantee is enforced. This Article also

194


-----

provides that both bondholders’ and guarantors’ credits will be classified according to what is more
beneficial for the insolvent debtor. The Guarantors’ credits against the Issuer would be subordinated
because they are related entities, as discussed above. Although there are no clear judicial precedents in
respect of this matter, under Article 87.6 a bondholder’s credits might be classified as subordinated,
notwithstanding their original qualification as ordinary credits, because the classification as
subordinated (instead of ordinary credits) would be more beneficial to the insolvent party.

In the event that any of the Guarantors becomes insolvent and is subject to the current Spanish
Insolvency Law, its Guarantee will be treated as ordinary debt. Under the current Spanish Insolvency
Law, the funding loans between the Spanish Guarantors and the Issuer would be treated as
subordinated debt. In addition, creditors may seek repayment directly from the insolvent entity’s
directors or attorneys in fact if a court determines that the bankruptcy resulted from their negligence
(concurso culpable), if some legal requirements are met.

_Moratorium_

The current Spanish Insolvency Law imposes a moratorium on the enforcement of secured
creditor’s rights in the event of insolvency. The moratorium would take effect following the declaration
of insolvency until the earlier of (i) one year from the declaration of the insolvency if the insolvent
company has not been placed in liquidation or (ii) the date the creditors reach an agreement that does
not affect the exercise of the rights granted by the security interest. However, such moratorium may
only be imposed where the assets subject to the guarantee are necessary for the debtor’s activity.

**_Limitations on Enforcement of Guarantees and Security Interests_**

Under Spanish law, claims may become time-barred (5 years being the general term established for
obligations in personam under Article 1,964 of the Spanish Civil Code (C´odigo Civil)) or may be or
become subject to the defense of set-off or counterclaim.

The terms ‘‘enforceable,’’ ‘‘enforceability,’’ ‘‘valid,’’ ‘‘legal,’’ ‘‘binding’’ and ‘‘effective’’ (or any
combination thereof) mean that all the obligations assumed by the relevant party under the relevant
documents are of a type enforced by Spanish courts; the terms do not mean that these obligations will
necessarily be enforced in all circumstances in accordance with their terms. In particular, enforcement
before the courts will in any event be subject to:

  - the nature of the remedies available in the courts; and

  - the availability of defenses such as (without limitation), set-off (unless validly waived), fraud
(fraude de ley), abuse in the exercise of rights (abuso de derecho), misrepresentation, force
majeure, unforeseen circumstances, undue influence, duress, abatement and counterclaim.

In general terms, under Spanish law, any guarantee, pledge or mortgage must guarantee or secure
another obligation to which it is ancillary, which must be clearly identified in the relevant guarantee or
security agreement. Therefore, the guarantee or security interest follows the underlying obligation in
such a way that nullity of the underlying obligation entails nullity of the guarantee or security and
termination of the underlying obligation entails termination of the guarantee or security. In the event
that the security providers are able to prove that there are no existing and valid guaranteed obligations,
Spanish courts may consider that the security providers’ obligations under the relevant guarantees or
securities are not enforceable.

The obligations under the Guarantee granted by a Spanish Guarantor:

  - shall not extend to any use of the proceeds of the Notes for the purpose of acquiring shares
representing the share capital of such Spanish Guarantor or shares representing the share
capital of its holding company, or refinancing a previous debt incurred for the acquisition of
shares representing the share capital of such Spanish Guarantor or shares representing the
share capital of its holding company; and

  - shall be deemed not to be undertaken or incurred by the Spanish Guarantor to the extent that
the same would constitute unlawful financial assistance within the meaning of Article 150 of
the Spanish Companies Act (Real Decreto Legislativo 1/2010, de 2 de Julio, approving Texto
Refundido de la Ley de Sociedades de Capital), and, in that case, all provisions of such
Guarantee shall be construed accordingly in the sense that, in no case can any Guarantee or
security given by the Spanish Guarantor secure repayment of the above mentioned funds.

195


-----

Under Spanish law, the ability of the Security Trustee to enforce the collateral consisting of
pledges governed by Spanish law may be restricted. In this regard, you should be aware of the
following:

  - Spanish law does not expressly forbid the possibility of creating more than a single pledge
over the same assets or rights. Nevertheless, some scholars and practitioners believe that
Spanish law may indirectly forbid the creation of multiple pledges over the same assets or
rights. To the best of our knowledge, there is no Spanish Supreme Court case law that directly
resolves this issue.

  - Catalan law expressly forbids granting more than one pledge over the same assets or rights
(unless the pledges are given for the benefit of the same creditors). However, some scholars
and practitioners believe that since Catalan law does not expressly provide for the creation of
a pledge securing different obligations, it would be possible to create one single pledge
securing different obligations without any restriction. To the best of our knowledge, there is no
Spanish Supreme Court case law that directly resolves this issue.

  - Under Spanish law, pledges are governed by the law where the pledged assets are located (lex
_rei sitae). Collateral consisting of concurrent pledges over the same assets will be governed by_
Spanish state law (which, as described above, does not expressly forbid granting more than
one pledge over the same asset), as these assets will be located in a place where only Spanish
state law is applicable.

  - Spanish law does not recognize the concept of security trustees and, therefore, trust structures
may not be recognized by Spanish courts. In this case, there is a risk that a Spanish court
would consider a pledge given for the benefit of a security trustee as a number of concurrent,
independent pledges, each of them securing the rights of each of the individual beneficiaries
of the trust. In this case, if these pledges are governed by Catalan law, there is the possibility
that only one of the pledges will be valid, and the remaining pledges will be deemed null and
void. However, as mentioned above, some scholars and practitioners believe that since Catalan
law does not expressly provide for the creation of a pledge securing different obligations, it
would be possible to create one single pledge securing different obligations without any
restriction. To the best of our knowledge, there is no Spanish Supreme Court case law that
directly resolves this issue.

As a result, the Security Trustee may not be able to enforce the pledges on behalf of all of the
secured creditors, and secured creditors treated under Spanish law as not having the benefit of the
pledges effectively may be treated as unsecured creditors.

**BOOK-ENTRY, DELIVERY AND FORM**

**General**

Each series of Notes sold to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the U.S.
Securities Act will initially be represented by a global note in registered form without interest coupons
attached (the ‘‘Rule 144A Global Notes’’). Each series of Notes sold to non-U.S. persons outside the
United States in reliance on Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act will initially be represented by
a global note in registered form without interest coupons attached (the ‘‘Regulation S Global Notes’’
and, together with the Rule 144A Global Notes, the ‘‘Global Notes’’). The Global Notes will be
deposited, on the Issue Date, with a common depositary and registered in the name of the nominee of
the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.

Ownership of interests in the Rule 144A Global Notes (‘‘Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests’’) and
ownership of interests in the Regulation S Global Notes (the ‘‘Regulation S Book-Entry Interests’’ and,
together with the Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests, the ‘‘Book-Entry Interests’’) will be limited to
persons that have accounts with Euroclear and/or Clearstream or persons that hold interests through
such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream will hold interests in the Global Notes on behalf of their
participants through customers’ securities accounts in their respective names on the books of their
respective depositories. Except under the limited circumstances described below, Book-Entry Interests
will not be issued in definitive form.

Book-Entry Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be effected only through, records
maintained in book-entry form by Euroclear and Clearstream and their participants. The Book-Entry
Interests in Global Notes will be issued only in denominations of A100,000 and in integral multiples of
A1,000 in excess thereof. The laws of some jurisdictions, including certain states of the United States,
may require that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of those securities in definitive
form. The foregoing limitations may impair your ability to own, transfer or pledge Book-Entry
Interests. In addition, while the Notes are in global form, holders of Book-Entry Interests will not be
considered the registered owners or ‘‘holders’’ of Notes for any purpose.

So long as the Notes are held in global form, the common depositary for Euroclear and/or
Clearstream (or their respective nominees), as applicable, will be considered the sole holders of the
Global Notes for all purposes under the respective Indentures. In addition, participants must rely on
the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, and indirect participants must rely on the procedures of
Euroclear and Clearstream and the participants through which they own Book-Entry Interests, to
transfer their interests or to exercise any rights of holders of Notes under the respective Indentures.

None of the Issuer, the Guarantors, the Trustee or the Agents or any of their respective affiliates
will have any responsibility, or be liable, for any aspect of the records relating to the Book-Entry
Interests.

For the purpose of Luxembourg law, ownership of the Notes will be evidenced through registration
from time to time at the registered office of the Issuer, and such registration is a means of evidencing
title to the Notes.

**Redemption of the Global Notes**

In the event that any Global Note (or any portion thereof) is redeemed, Euroclear and/or
Clearstream, as applicable, will redeem an equal amount of the Book-Entry Interests in such Global
Note from the amount received by them in respect of the redemption of such Global Note. The
redemption price payable in connection with the redemption of such Book-Entry Interests will be equal
to the amount received by Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable, in connection with the redemption
of such Global Note (or any portion thereof). The Issuer understands that, under the existing practices
of Euroclear and Clearstream, if fewer than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, Euroclear
and Clearstream will credit their respective participants’ accounts on a proportionate basis (with
adjustments to prevent fractions) or on such other basis as they deem fair and appropriate unless
otherwise required by law or applicable stock exchange or depositary requirements.

**Payments on Global Notes**

The Issuer will make payments of any amounts owing in respect of the relevant Global Notes
(including principal, premium, if any, interest and Additional Amounts, if any) to the Paying Agent.

197


-----

The Paying Agent will, in turn, make such payments to the common depositary or its nominees for
Euroclear and Clearstream, which will distribute such payments to participants in accordance with their
respective customary procedures. All payments required to be made by the Issuer with respect to the
Notes, or by any Guarantor under its Guarantee, will be made free and clear of, and without deduction
or withholding for, or on account of, any present or future taxes, duties, assessments or governmental
charges of whatever nature, except as may be required by law and as described under ‘‘Description of
the Notes—Additional Amounts.’’ If any such deduction or withholding is required to be made, then,
to the extent as described under ‘‘Description of the Notes—Additional Amounts,’’ the Issuer will pay
additional amounts as may be necessary in order for the net amounts received by any holder of the
relevant Global Notes or owner of Book-Entry Interests after such deduction or withholding to equal
the net amounts that such holder or owner would have otherwise received in respect of such Global
Note or Book-Entry Interest, as the case may be, absent such withholding or deduction. The Issuer
expects that standing customer instructions and customary practices will govern payments by
participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through such participants.

Under the terms of the respective Indentures, the Issuer, the Trustee and the relevant Agents will
treat the registered holders of the Global Notes (e.g., Euroclear or Clearstream (or their respective
nominees)) as the owner thereof for the purpose of receiving payments and for all other purposes.
Consequently, none of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Agents or any of their respective agents has or will
have any responsibility or liability for:

  - any aspect of the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant
relating to, or payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest or for maintaining,
supervising or reviewing the records of Euroclear or Clearstream or any participant or indirect
participant relating to, or payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest;

  - Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant; or

  - the records of the common depositary.

Payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through participants are the
responsibility of such participants.

**Currency of Payment for the Global Notes**

The principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of, the
Global Notes, will be paid to holders of interest in such Notes (the ‘‘Holders’’) through Euroclear
and/or Clearstream in euro.

**Action by Owners of Book-Entry Interests**

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised us that they will take any action permitted to be taken by
a holder of a Note (including the presentation of Notes for exchange as described above) only at the
direction of one or more participants to whose account the Book-Entry Interests in the Global Notes
are credited and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of Notes as to which
such participant or participants has or have given such direction. Euroclear and Clearstream will not
exercise any discretion in the granting of consents, waivers or the taking of any other action in respect
of the Global Notes. However, if there is an Event of Default under the relevant Notes, each of
Euroclear and Clearstream, at the request of the holders of such Notes, reserve the right to exchange
the Global Notes for definitive registered Notes in certificated form (the ‘‘Definitive Registered
Notes’’), and to distribute such Definitive Registered Notes to their participants.

**Transfers**

Transfers between participants in Euroclear and Clearstream will be effected in accordance with
Euroclear and Clearstream’s rules and will be settled in immediately available funds. If a holder of a
Note requires physical delivery of Definitive Registered Notes for any reason, including to sell Notes to
persons in states that require physical delivery of such securities or to pledge such securities, such
holder of Notes must transfer its interests in the Global Notes in accordance with the normal
procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream and in accordance with the procedures set forth in the
relevant Indenture.

198


-----

The Global Notes will each bear a legend to the effect set forth under ‘‘Notice to Investors.’’
Book-Entry Interests in the Global Notes will be subject to the restrictions on transfers and
certification requirements discussed under ‘‘Notice to Investors.’’

Transfers of Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests to persons wishing to take delivery of Rule 144A
Book Entry Interests will at all times be subject to such transfer restrictions.

Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of
a Regulation S Book-Entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in
the form provided in the relevant Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in
accordance with Regulation S or Rule 144 under the U.S. Securities Act or any other exemption (if
available under the U.S. Securities Act).

Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form
of a Rule 144A Book-Entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in
the form provided in the relevant Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a person
who the transferor reasonably believes is a ‘‘qualified institutional buyer’’ within the meaning of
Rule 144A in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance with the
transfer restrictions described under ‘‘Notice to Investors’’ and in accordance with any applicable
securities laws of any other jurisdiction.

In connection with transfers involving an exchange of a Regulation S Book-Entry Interest for a
Rule 144A Book-Entry Interest, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in the
principal amount of the Regulation S Global Note and a corresponding increase in the principal
amount of the Rule 144A Global Note.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests in a
Global Note only as described under ‘‘Description of the Notes—Transfers,’’ as the case may be and, if
required, only if the transferor first delivers to the relevant Trustee a written certificate (in the form
provided in the relevant Indenture) to the effect that such transfer will comply with the appropriate
transfer restrictions applicable to such Notes. See ‘‘Notice to Investors.’’

Any Book-Entry Interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes
delivery in the form of a Book-Entry Interest in any other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be
a Book-Entry Interest in the first-mentioned Global Note and become a Book-Entry Interest in the
other Global Note, and accordingly will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and
other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in such other Global Note for as long as it remains
such a Book-Entry Interest.

**Definitive Registered Notes**

Under the terms of each Indenture, owners of the Book-Entry Interests will receive Definitive
Registered Notes:

(1) if Euroclear or Clearstream notifies the Issuer that it is unwilling or unable to continue to act
as depositary and a successor depositary is not appointed by the Issuer within 120 days; or

(2) if the owner of a Book-Entry Interest requests such exchange in writing delivered through
Euroclear or Clearstream following an event of default under the relevant Indenture and
enforcement action is being taken in respect thereof under the Indenture.

In such an event, the Registrar will issue Definitive Registered Notes, registered in the name or
names and issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of Euroclear and/or
Clearstream or the Issuer (in accordance with their respective customary procedures and based upon
directions received from participants reflecting the beneficial ownership of Book-Entry Interests), and
such Definitive Registered Notes will bear the restrictive legend as provided in the relevant Indenture,
unless that legend is not required by such Indenture or applicable law.

To the extent permitted by law, the Issuer, the Trustee and the Agents shall be entitled to treat the
registered holder of any Global Note as the absolute owner thereof and no person will be liable for
treating the registered holder as such. Ownership of the Global Notes will be evidenced through
registration from time to time at the registered office of the Issuer, and such registration is a means of
evidencing title to the Notes.

199


-----

We will not impose any fees or other charges in respect of the Notes; however, owners of the
Book Entry Interests may incur fees normally payable in respect of the maintenance and operation of
accounts in Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable.

**Information Concerning Euroclear and Clearstream**

All Book-Entry Interests will be subject to the operations and procedures of Euroclear and
Clearstream, as applicable. We provide the following summaries of those operations and procedures
solely for the convenience of investors. The operations and procedures of the settlement, the Trustee,
the Agents, system are controlled by the settlement system and may be changed at any time. Neither
the Issuer nor any of the Initial Purchasers is responsible for those operations or procedures.

The Issuer understands as follows with respect to Euroclear and Clearstream: Euroclear and
Clearstream hold securities for participating organizations. They facilitate the clearance and settlement
of securities transactions between their participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts
of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide various services to their participants, including
the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of internationally traded
securities. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with domestic securities markets. Euroclear and
Clearstream participants are financial institutions such as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers,
banks, trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear and Clearstream is
also available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or
maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear and Clearstream participant, either directly or
indirectly.

Because Euroclear and Clearstream can act only on behalf of participants, who in turn act on
behalf of indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to
pledge such interest to persons or entities that do not participate in the Euroclear and/or Clearstream
systems, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definitive
certificate for that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical
delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such
persons may be limited. In addition, owners of beneficial interests through the Euroclear or
Clearstream systems will receive distributions attributable to the Rule 144A Global Notes only through
Euroclear or Clearstream participants.

**Global Clearance and Settlement under the Book-Entry System**

The Notes represented by the Global Notes are expected to be listed on the Official List of the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted for trading on the Euro MTF market of the Luxembourg
Stock Exchange. Transfers of Interests in the Global Notes between participants in Euroclear and
Clearstream will be effected in the ordinary ways in accordance with their respective rules and
operating procedures.

Although Euroclear and Clearstream currently follow the foregoing procedures in order to
facilitate transfers of interests in the Global Notes among participants in Euroclear or Clearstream, as
the case may be, they are under no obligation to perform or continue to perform such procedures, and
such procedures may be discontinued or modified at any time. None of the Issuer, the Guarantors, the
Initial Purchasers, the Trustee or the Agents will have any responsibility for the performance by
Euroclear, Clearstream or their participants or indirect participants of their respective obligations under
the rules and procedures governing their operations.

**Initial Settlement**

Initial settlement for the Notes will be made in euro. Book-Entry Interests owned through
Euroclear or Clearstream accounts will follow the settlement procedures applicable to conventional
bonds in registered form. Book-Entry Interests will be credited to the securities custody accounts of
Euroclear and Clearstream holders on the business day following the settlement date against payment
for value of the settlement date.

**Secondary Market Trading**

The Book-Entry Interests will trade through participants of Euroclear or Clearstream and will
settle in same-day funds. Since the purchase determines the place of delivery, it is important to
establish at the time of trading of any Book-Entry Interests where both the purchaser’s and the seller’s
accounts are located to ensure that settlement can be made on the desired value date.

**TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

The information provided below does not purport to be a complete analysis of the tax law and
practice currently applicable in Luxembourg, the United States, France or Spain and does not purport
to address the tax consequences applicable to all categories of investors, some of which may be subject
to special rules.

Prospective purchasers of the Notes are advised to consult their own tax advisors as to the tax
consequences of a purchase of Notes including, without limitation, the consequences of receipt of
interest and premium paid (if any), and the sale or redemption of the Notes or any interest therein.

The summaries set forth below are based upon Luxembourg, the United States, French or Spanish
law as in effect on the date of this Offering Memorandum and are subject to any change in such law
that may take effect after such date. References in this section to holders of Notes include the
beneficial owners of the Notes. The statements regarding the Luxembourg and U.S. laws and practices
set forth below assume that the Notes will be issued, and transfers thereof will be made, in accordance
with the Indentures.

**Luxembourg Taxation**

**_Withholding Tax, Income Tax_**

_Taxation of Interest_

There is no withholding tax for Luxembourg residents and non-residents on payments of interest
(including accrued but unpaid interest) in respect of Notes, which are not profit participating, nor is
any Luxembourg withholding tax payable on payments received upon repayment of the principal or
upon an exchange of Notes except that in certain circumstances a withholding tax may be required to
be paid on interest pursuant to the law of December 23, 2005, as amended (the ‘‘Interest Withholding
Tax Law’’).

By the Interest Withholding Tax Law, effective as of January 1, 2006, Luxembourg introduced a
withholding tax of 10% on savings income in the form of interest paid or secured by a Luxembourg
paying agent to or for the benefit of beneficial owners, who are individuals, resident in Luxembourg
and residual entities (i.e. entities (i) that are not legal persons (whereby certain Swedish and Finnish
entities which have legal personality are nevertheless treated as not being a separate legal person for
this provision), (ii) whose profits are not taxed under the general arrangements for business taxation;
and (iii) which are not (or have not opted to be considered as) a UCITS recognized in accordance with
the Council Directive 85/611/EEC, as replaced by the Directive 2009/65/EC of the European Parliament
and of the Council, the ‘‘Residual Entities’’) established in other EU Member States or certain
dependent and associated territories thereof (to the extent beneficial owners who are individuals
resident in Luxembourg have an interest in such entities and, according to the Interest Withholding Tax
Law, if the Residual Entity has not opted for information exchange or to be treated as a UCITS). For
an individual holder of Notes who is a resident of Luxembourg and who acts in the course of the
management of his private wealth, the 10% withholding tax is a final levy (the ‘‘10% WHT’’).

Furthermore, a Luxembourg resident individual who acts in the course of the management of
his/her private wealth and who is the beneficial owner of an interest payment made by a paying agent
established outside Luxembourg in an EU Member State or in a member of the European Economic
Area or in a jurisdiction having concluded an agreement with Luxembourg in connection with the
European Council Directive 2003/48/EC of June 3, 2003 on the taxation of savings income in the form
of interest payments, as amended and repealed, may also, in accordance with the Withholding Tax Law,
opt for a final 10% levy (the ‘‘10% Levy’’). In such case, the 10% Levy is calculated on the same
amounts as for the payments made by Luxembourg resident paying agents. The option for the 10%
Levy must cover all interest payments made by the paying agent to the Luxembourg resident beneficial
owner during the entire civil year.

A holder of Notes is subject to Luxembourg income tax in respect of the interest paid or accrued
on the Notes only if such holder (i) is or is deemed to be a resident of Luxembourg for tax purposes
and the interest falls within the scope of the 10% Levy but the holder has not opted for the application
of the 10% Levy or (ii) is or is deemed to be a resident of Luxembourg for tax purposes and the
interest has not been received by him in the course of the management of his private wealth or

201


-----

(iii) such income is attributable to an enterprise or part thereof, which is carried on through a fixed
place of business, a permanent establishment or a permanent representative in Luxembourg.

Responsibility for the withholding of tax in application of the Interest Withholding Tax Law is
assumed by the Luxembourg paying agent (within the meaning of the Interest Withholding Tax Law),
which is not necessarily the issuer of Notes.

_Taxation of Capital Gains_

Gains realized by an individual holder of Notes, who acts in the course of the management of
his/her private wealth and who is resident in Luxembourg for tax purposes, are not subject to
Luxembourg income tax, unless they (i) correspond to redemption premiums or issue discounts or
(ii) are speculative gains within the meaning of Luxembourg income tax law. Gains on the Notes will
be speculative gains within the meaning of Luxembourg income tax law and trigger taxation at the
Luxembourg full income tax rate if the sales of the Notes giving rise to the capital gains occur six
months or less after their acquisition or if their disposal precedes their acquisition. For a Luxembourg
resident individual holder of Notes or a Residual Entity to the extent beneficial owners who are
individuals resident in Luxembourg have an interest in such an entity, the portion of the gain
corresponding to accrued but unpaid interest will be considered as interest income and will be taxed as
described under ‘‘—Withholding Tax, Income Tax—Taxation of Interest.’’

Gains realized by a corporate holder of Notes or by an individual holder of Notes, who acts in the
course of the management of a professional or business undertaking, who is resident in Luxembourg
for tax purposes or who has a permanent establishment, a fixed place of business or a permanent
representative in Luxembourg, to which the Notes are attributable, will be subject to Luxembourg
income tax on the sale of Notes.

Gains realized by a nonresident holder of Notes, who does not have a permanent establishment, a
fixed place of business or a permanent representative in Luxembourg to which the Notes or the gains
realized thereon are attributable, will not be subject to Luxembourg income tax on the sale of Notes
except that, in the situation where the nonresident holder of Notes is a Residual Entity in which
beneficial owners who are individuals resident in Luxembourg have an interest, the portion of the gain
corresponding to accrued but unpaid interest will be taxed as described under ‘‘—Withholding Tax,
Income Tax—Taxation of Interest.’’

**_Registration Taxes_**

Under current Luxembourg tax law and current administrative practice, it is not compulsory that
the Notes be notarized, recorded or enrolled with any court or other authority in Luxembourg or that
registration tax, transfer tax, capital tax, stamp duty or any other similar tax or duty be paid in respect
of or in connection with the execution, delivery and/or enforcement by legal proceedings (including any
foreign judgment in the courts of Luxembourg) of the Notes, except that in the event of court
proceedings in a Luxembourg court (including, but not limited to, a Luxembourg insolvency
proceeding), registration of the Notes or of the financial documents may be ordered by the court, and
even in the absence of such order, could in principle be required in the event the relevant Notes are
produced either directly or by way of reference in any act introducing legal proceedings (including, but
not limited to, a Luxembourg insolvency proceeding). In such a case, a fixed or an ad valorem
registration duty calculated on the amounts mentioned in the Notes shall apply and be payable by the
party(ies) benefiting from the Notes. In principle, registration would also be required, and the same
registration duties would be due, if the Notes were produced, either directly or by way of reference,
before an official authority (autorit´e constitu´ee) in Luxembourg.

**_Other Taxes_**

Luxembourg net wealth tax will not be levied on a holder of a Note unless:

  - such holder is, or is deemed to be, resident in Luxembourg for the purpose of the relevant
provisions to the exception of the following entities that are net wealth tax exempt, being
(i) undertakings for collective investment (UCITS) within the meaning of the law of
December 17, 2010, as amended (ii) investment company in risk capital (SICAR) within the
meaning of the law dated June 15, 2004 as amended (except for the Luxembourg minimum

202


-----

annual net wealth tax (EUR 3,120 for companies investing predominantly (i.e. more than
90%) in financial assets and between EUR 535 and EUR 32,100 for other companies))
(iii) securitization entities within the meaning of the law dated March 22, 2004, as amended
(except for the Luxembourg minimum annual net wealth tax) and (iv) special investment funds
within the meaning of the law of February 13, 2007 as amended; or

  - such Note is attributable to an enterprise or part thereof, which is carried on through a
permanent establishment, a permanent representative or a fixed place of business in
Luxembourg.

With regard to individuals, the Interest Withholding Tax Law has abrogated the net wealth tax
starting with the year 2006. No estate or inheritance tax is levied on the transfer of Notes upon the
death of a holder of Notes in cases where the deceased was not a resident of Luxembourg for
inheritance tax purposes and no gift tax is levied upon a gift of Notes if the gift is not passed before a
Luxembourg notary or recorded in a deed registered in Luxembourg. Where a holder of Notes is
resident for tax purposes in Luxembourg at the time of his/her death, the Notes are included in its
taxable estate for inheritance tax or estate tax purposes.

There is no Luxembourg value added tax payable in respect of payments in consideration for the
issuance of the Notes or in respect of the payment of interest or principal under the Notes or the
transfer of the Notes. Luxembourg value added tax may, however, be payable in respect of fees charged
for certain services rendered to the Issuer, if for Luxembourg value added tax purposes such services
are rendered or are deemed to be rendered in Luxembourg and an exemption from Luxembourg value
added tax does not apply with respect to such services.

**_Exchange of Information_**

_Common Reporting Standard_

The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development has developed a new global
standard for the automatic exchange of financial information between tax authorities (the ‘‘CRS’’).
Luxembourg is a signatory jurisdiction to the CRS and intends to conduct its first exchange of
information with tax authorities of other signatory jurisdictions in September 2017, as regards
reportable financial information gathered in relation to fiscal year 2016. The CRS has been
implemented in Luxembourg via the law dated 18 December 2015 concerning the automatic exchange
of information on financial accounts and tax matters and implementing the EU Directive 2014/107/EU
(the ‘‘CRS Law’’). The regulations may impose obligations on the Issuer and holders of Notes, if the
Issuer is considered as a Reporting Financial Institution (e.g. an Investment Entity) under the CRS, so
that the latter could be required to conduct due diligence and obtain (among other things)
confirmation of the tax residency, tax identification number and CRS classification of holders of Notes
in order to fulfil its own legal obligations from 1 January 2016. Further, the holders of Notes have
permitted the Issuer to share such information with the relevant taxing authority. It is intended that the
Issuer will fully comply with CRS regulations.

**Foreign Account Tax Compliance**

The Intergovernmental Agreement (‘‘IGA’’) between the United States and Luxembourg to
improve International Tax Compliance and with respect to the United States information reporting
provisions commonly known as the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (‘‘FATCA’’) has been ratified
by Luxembourg’s Parliament and implemented into Luxembourg domestic legislation on 24 July 2015
(the ‘‘Luxembourg IGA Legislation’’).

Under the terms of the IGA, the Issuer is obliged to comply with the provisions of FATCA under
the terms of the IGA and under the terms of the Luxembourg IGA Legislation, rather than under the
US Treasury Regulations implementing FATCA. Under the IGA, Luxembourg-resident financial
institutions that comply with the requirements of the Luxembourg IGA Legislation are treated as
compliant with FATCA and, as a result, are not subject to withholding tax under FATCA (‘‘FATCA
Withholding’’). The Issuer expects that it is considered to be a Luxembourg resident financial
institution that needs to comply with the requirements of the Luxembourg IGA Legislation and, as a
result of such compliance, the Issuer should not be subject to FATCA Withholding.

203


-----

While the Issuer itself should not be subject to FATCA Withholding, (a) US holders of Notes who
fail to waive rights to prevent the Issuer from complying with its disclosure obligations under the
Luxembourg IGA and the Luxembourg IGA Legislation, (b) persons who fail to establish their non-US
status, (c) non-US financial institution investors that themselves do not comply with the US Treasury
Regulations or an applicable IGA and (d) certain other non-US entities that do not provide
certifications or information regarding their US ownership, may be subject to FATCA Withholding on
their share of payments made to or from the Issuer.

Additionally, under the Luxembourg IGA, the Issuer may be required to report to the Luxembourg
tax authorities certain holdings by and payments made to (a) certain US holders of Notes, (b) certain
US controlled foreign entity holders of Notes and (c) non-US financial institution holders of Notes that
do not comply with the terms of the US Treasury Regulations or an applicable IGA. Under the
Luxembourg IGA, such information is onward reported by the Luxembourg tax authorities to the US
Internal Revenue Service.

Holders of Notes should contact their own tax advisers regarding the application of FATCA to
their particular circumstances.

**Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations**

The following discussion is a general summary of certain U.S. federal income tax consequences of
the purchase, ownership and disposition of Notes by a U.S. holder (as defined below) that holds its
Notes as capital assets (generally, property held for investment) and that purchases the Notes in the
Offerings for cash at their ‘‘issue price’’ (generally, the first price at which a substantial amount of the
applicable series of Notes is sold to the public for cash, excluding sales to bond houses, brokers or
similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents or
wholesalers). This summary is based on the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the ‘‘Code’’),
Treasury regulations issued thereunder (the ‘‘Regulations’’) and rulings, judicial decisions and
administrative pronouncements related thereto, all as in effect as of the date hereof, and all of which
are subject to change or changes in interpretation, possibly with retroactive effect.

This summary does not address all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may apply to
holders that are subject to special tax rules, including U.S. expatriates, insurance companies, tax-exempt
entities, banks, financial institutions, persons subject to the alternative minimum tax, securities brokerdealers, regulated investment companies, traders in securities that elect to use the mark to market
method of accounting for their securities, persons holding their Notes as part of a hedging, integrated,
constructive sale or conversion transaction or a straddle, or persons whose functional currency is not
the U.S. dollar. These holders may be subject to U.S. federal income tax consequences different from
those set forth below. This summary does not address the Medicare tax on net investment income,
other federal tax laws (such as estate and gift tax laws) or any state, local or non-U.S. tax laws. If a
partnership (including for this purpose any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S.
federal income tax purposes) holds Notes, the tax treatment of a partner generally will depend upon
the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. A partner in a partnership that holds
Notes is urged to consult its tax advisor regarding the specific tax consequences of the purchase,
ownership and disposition of the Notes.

For purposes of this discussion, the term ‘‘U.S. holder’’ means a beneficial owner of Notes (as
determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes) who is (a) a citizen or individual resident of the
United States, (b) a corporation (or other entity taxable as a corporation) created or organized in or
under the laws of the United States or any state thereof or the District of Columbia, (c) an estate the
income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source, or (d) a trust if a
court within the United States can exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and
one or more U.S. persons are authorized to control all substantial decisions of the trust or if a valid
election is in place to treat the trust as a U.S. person.

U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the specific Luxembourg, other non-U.S.
and U.S. federal, state and local tax consequences of purchasing, owning and disposing of Notes in
light of their particular circumstances as well as any consequences arising under the laws of any other
relevant taxing jurisdiction.

204


-----

**_Payments of Stated Interest_**

Stated interest paid on the Notes (including a payment of any Additional Amounts and any
non-U.S. taxes withheld on such payments of stated interest or Additional Amounts) will be includible
in the gross income of a U.S. holder as ordinary interest income at the time the interest is received or
accrued, depending on the U.S. holder’s method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

A cash method U.S. holder will be required to include in gross income the U.S. dollar value of the
interest payment, based on the spot exchange rate on the date of receipt, regardless of whether the
payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars at that time. A cash method U.S. holder will not realize
foreign currency exchange gain or loss on the receipt of the interest income but may recognize
exchange gain or loss upon the actual disposition of the euro so received.

An accrual method U.S. holder may determine the amount of income recognized with respect to
such interest in accordance with either of two methods. Under the first method, an accrual method
U.S. holder will be required to include in gross income the interest income that has accrued on the
Notes during an interest accrual period in euro and translate that amount into U.S. dollars at the
average rate of exchange in effect for the interest accrual period (or, with respect to an accrual period
that spans two taxable years, at the average rate for the partial period within the U.S. holder’s taxable
year). The average rate of exchange for an interest accrual period (or partial period) is the simple
average of the spot exchange rates for each business day of the period or other average rate for the
period that is reasonably derived and consistently applied by the holder. Under the second method, an
accrual method U.S. holder may make an election to translate interest income at the spot rate on
(i) the last day of the interest accrual period, (ii) the last day of the taxable year in the case of a partial
accrual period, or (iii) the date of receipt or payment if such date is within five business days of the
last day of the accrual period. This election must be applied consistently to all debt instruments from
year to year and cannot be changed without the consent of the Internal Revenue Service (the ‘‘IRS’’).
An accrual method U.S. holder generally will realize exchange gain or loss with respect to accrued
interest income on the date the interest payment actually is received. The amount of exchange gain or
loss to be recognized by the holder will be an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the U.S.
dollar value of the euro interest payment received (determined on the basis of the spot rate on the
date the interest income is received) in respect of the accrual period and the U.S. dollar value of the
interest income that has accrued during the accrual period (as determined above), regardless of
whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars at that time. This exchange gain or loss
generally will be treated as U.S.-source ordinary income or loss and generally will not be treated as an
adjustment to interest income or expense.

**_Foreign Tax Credit_**

Stated interest paid on the Notes (including the payment of any Additional Amounts and any
non-U.S. taxes withheld on such payments of interest or Additional Amounts) generally will constitute
foreign-source income. For purposes of computing allowable foreign tax credits for U.S. federal income
tax purposes, interest generally will be treated as ‘‘passive category’’ income, or, in the case of certain
U.S. holders, ‘‘general category’’ income. The rules relating to foreign tax credits are complex and U.S.
holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the availability of a foreign tax credit and the
application of the foreign tax credit limitations to their particular situation.

**_Sale or Other Taxable Disposition_**

Upon the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of the Notes, a U.S.
holder generally will recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between the amount
realized (other than amounts attributable to accrued and unpaid interest, which will be taxable as
ordinary interest income to the extent not previously included in income) and such holder’s adjusted
tax basis in the Notes. The amount realized generally will equal the amount of any cash plus the fair
market value of any property received in exchange for the Notes, translated into U.S. dollars at the
spot rate on the date of disposition. A U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Notes generally will be
the cost of such Note to the U.S. holder. The cost of a Note purchased with euro will be the U.S.
dollar value of the euro purchase price on the date of purchase, calculated at the spot rate in effect on
that date. If the Notes are traded on an established securities market, a cash method taxpayer and an
electing accrual method taxpayer will determine the U.S. dollar value of the amount realized by

205


-----

translating that amount at the spot rate on the settlement date of the sale or other taxable disposition,
and will determine the U.S. dollar value of the cost of the Notes at the spot rate on the settlement
date of the purchase. If an accrual method taxpayer makes this election, the election must be applied
consistently by the taxpayer from year to year and once made cannot be revoked without the consent of
the IRS.

Except as discussed in the following paragraph with respect to foreign currency exchange gains or
losses, any gain or loss recognized upon the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable
disposition of the Notes by a U.S. holder generally will be U.S.-source capital gain or loss, and will be
long-term capital gain or loss if the Notes have been held for more than one year at the time of the
sale or other disposition. Long-term capital gains recognized by a non-corporate U.S. holder (including
an individual) generally are subject to U.S. federal income taxation at preferential rates. The
deductibility of capital losses is subject to significant limitations.

Gain or loss realized upon the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition
of the Notes that is attributable to fluctuations in currency exchange rates will constitute exchange gain
or loss with respect to the principal amount to the extent provided under special rules. This exchange
gain or loss generally will be taxable as U.S.-source ordinary income or loss, but generally will not be
treated as interest income or expense. For these purposes, the principal amount of a Note is a U.S.
holder’s purchase price for the Note calculated in euro on the date of purchase. A U.S. holder will
recognize exchange gain or loss on the principal amount of the Notes equal to the difference between
(i) the U.S. dollar value of the euro principal amount of the Notes determined at the spot rate on the
date of the sale or other taxable disposition and (ii) the U.S. dollar value of the euro principal amount
of the Notes determined at the spot rate on the date the U.S. holder acquired the Notes (or, in each
case, determined on the settlement date, if the Notes are traded on an established securities market
and the holder is either a cash basis U.S. holder or an electing accrual basis U.S. holder). In addition,
upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. holder
may recognize exchange gain or loss attributable to amounts received with respect to accrued and
unpaid stated interest, if any, which will be treated as discussed above under ‘‘—Payments of Stated
Interest’’. However, a U.S. holder will recognize exchange gain or loss with respect to principal and
accrued and unpaid stated interest only to the extent of the total gain or loss realized on the sale or
other taxable disposition of the Notes.

**_Receipt of Euro_**

A U.S. holder may receive euro in payment for interest or principal. The tax basis of any euro
received by a U.S. holder generally will equal the U.S. dollar equivalent of the euro at the spot rate on
the date the euro are received. Upon any subsequent conversion or other disposition of the euro for
U.S. dollars, a U.S. holder generally will recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss equal to the
difference between the amount of U.S. dollars received and the U.S. holder’s tax basis in the euro. In
addition, upon any subsequent exchange of euro for property (including non-U.S. currency), a U.S.
holder generally will recognize exchange gain or loss equal to the difference between the U.S. dollar
value of the euro exchanged based on the U.S. dollar spot rate for euro on the date of the exchange
and the U.S. holder’s tax basis in the euro so exchanged. Exchange gain or loss generally will be
treated as U.S.-source ordinary income or loss.

**_Additional Notes_**

The Issuer may issue Additional Notes as described under ‘‘Description of the Notes.’’ These
Additional Notes, even if they are treated for non-tax purposes as part of the same series as the
applicable series of original Notes, in some cases may be treated as a separate series for U.S. federal
income tax purposes. In such case, the Additional Notes may be considered to have original issue
discount which may adversely affect the market value of the applicable series of original Notes if the
Additional Notes are not otherwise distinguishable from the applicable series of original Notes.

**_Tax Return Disclosure Requirements_**

A U.S. holder may be required to report receipt or accrual of interest on, or a sale or other
disposition of, its Notes on IRS Form 8886 (Reportable Transaction Disclosure Statement) if it
recognizes foreign currency exchange loss that exceeds US$50,000 in a single taxable year from a single

206


-----

transaction, if such U.S. holder is an individual or trust. Higher minimum amounts apply for other
non-individual U.S. holders. U.S. holders are urged to consult their tax advisors in this regard.

**_U.S. Information Reporting and Backup Withholding_**

Payments of interest on and proceeds from the sale or other disposition of Notes held by U.S.
holders may be subject to information reporting to the IRS. Payments of such amounts may also be
subject to backup withholding at a current rate of 28%. Certain exempt recipients (such as
corporations) are not subject to these information reporting requirements. Backup withholding will not
apply to a U.S. holder who furnishes a correct taxpayer identification number and makes any other
required certification, or who is otherwise exempt from backup withholding. U.S. persons who are
required to establish their exempt status generally must provide IRS Form W-9 (Request for Taxpayer
Identification Number and Certification). Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Amounts
withheld as backup withholding may be credited against a holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability. A
holder may obtain a refund of any excess amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules by
timely filing the appropriate claim for refund with the IRS and furnishing any required information.

**_Foreign Financial Asset Reporting_**

Individuals and certain entities that own ‘‘specified foreign financial assets’’ with an aggregate
value in excess of US$50,000 (or such higher amount specified in applicable regulations) generally are
required to file an information report with respect to such assets with their tax returns. ‘‘Specified
foreign financial assets’’ include any financial accounts maintained by foreign financial institutions, as
well as any of the following, but only if they are not held in accounts maintained by certain financial
institutions: (i) stocks and securities issued by non-U.S. persons; (ii) financial instruments and contracts
held for investment that have non-U.S. issuers or counterparties; and (iii) interests in foreign entities.
The Notes may be subject to these rules. Prospective investors are urged to consult their tax advisors
regarding the application of this legislation to their ownership of the Notes.

**French Taxation**

**_Taxation of Payments under the Guarantees Made by a French Resident Guarantor_**

In the absence of any judicial precedent or statement of practice issued by the French tax
authorities in respect of payments made under a guarantee, we do not express any opinion as to
whether the payments made by a French resident Guarantor under the Guarantees are subject to
withholding tax in France pursuant to article 182 B of the French tax code, according to which
payments made by a person who carries on a business in France to a non-resident person subject to
corporate income tax who has no permanent professional installation in France in consideration of
services (whatever their nature) rendered or used in France are subject to withholding tax in France.

We however note that: (i) in accordance with one interpretation of French tax law, payments made
under a Guarantee are to be treated as a payment in lieu of payments to be made on the Notes by the
Issuer and accordingly, the payments to be made by a French resident Guarantor under a Guarantee
should be exempt from withholding tax in France to the extent that payments are not made in a
non-cooperative jurisdiction within the meaning of article 238-0 A of the French Tax Code nor to a
person domiciled or established in a non-cooperative jurisdiction; (ii) in accordance with another
interpretation of French tax law, payments made under a Guarantee are to be treated as payments
independent from the payments to be made under the Notes and accordingly, and in the absence of
any specific provision to the contrary in the French tax code, such payments should be out of the scope
from withholding tax in France.

It cannot be ruled out, however, that the French tax authorities or French courts adopt a view
other than these two interpretations and consider such payments to be subject to withholding tax in
France. An exemption from this withholding tax could be available under double tax treaties entered
into by France.

**_Residents of France for Tax Purposes Holding Notes_**

_Individuals Holding Notes as Part of Their Private Assets_

_Interest and redemption premium._ Income from the Notes received by individuals holding the
Notes as part of their private assets is either included in total income, which is subject to:

  - personal income tax calculated on a progressive scale, after an initial withholding at a rate of
24%; plus

    - a general social contribution (contribution sociale g´en´eralis´ee) (‘‘CSG’’) at the rate of 8.2%,
5.1% of which is deductible from taxable income;

    - a social levy (pr´el`evement social) of 4.5%;

    - an additional contribution of 0.3% to the social levy and a solidarity levy (pr´el`evement de
_solidarit´e) of 2%; and_

    - a social debt repayment contribution (contribution au remboursement de la dette sociale)
(‘‘CRDS’’) of 0.5%.

_Capital gains._ Capital gains on the disposal of securities are subject to personal income tax
calculated on a progressive scale, to which is added:

  - a CSG at the rate of 8.2%, 5.1% of which is deductible from taxable income;

  - a social levy (pr´el`evement social) of 4.5%;

  - an additional contribution of 0.3% to the social levy and a solidarity levy (pr´el`evement de
solidarit´e) of 2%; and

  - a CRDS of 0.5%.

Capital losses incurred in one year can only be offset against capital gains of a similar nature
realized in the same year or in the 10 following years.

_Wealth tax._ Notes held by individuals are included in their taxable assets subject to wealth tax.

_Duties on inheritance and gifts._ Notes acquired by way of inheritance or gift are subject to French
inheritance and gifts duties.

_Legal Entities Subject to Corporate Income Tax_

_Interest and redemption premium._ Interest accrued on the Notes over the fiscal year is included in
taxable income subject to corporate tax at the rate of 33.33%. In addition, a social contribution of 3.3%
is also applicable. This contribution is calculated on the amount of corporate tax with an allowance of
A763,000 for each 12-month period. Furthermore, for fiscal years closed between December 31, 2011
and December 30, 2016, a temporary exceptional contribution is due by corporate income taxpayers
realizing an annual turnover exceeding A250,000,000. This exceptional contribution is equal to 10.7% of
the amount of the corporate income tax, before deduction of any tax credit or tax claim of any nature.
However, with respect to entities that have a turnover of less than A7,630,000 and whose share capital
is fully paid up and of which at least 75% is held continuously by individuals or by an entity meeting all
of these requirements, the corporate tax rate is set, within the limit of A38,120 of taxable income for
every 12-month period, at 15%. The latter entities are also exempt from the 3.3% social contribution
mentioned above.

In accordance with Article 238 septies E of the French tax code, companies must include a portion
of the redemption premium, which they record at the time of the subscription or acquisition of the
Notes, into the taxable results for each of their fiscal years, each time this premium exceeds 10% of the
subscription or acquisition price. For the purpose of these provisions, redemption premium means the
difference between the sums to be received from the Issuer, exclusive of straight-line interest paid each
year, and the sums paid on subscription or acquisition of the Notes. However, these provisions do not
apply to notes whose average issue price is higher than 90% of the redemption value. The taxable
annuity is obtained by applying the annual yield determined at the date of subscription or acquisition

208


-----

respectively to the subscription or acquisition price. This price is increased each year by the portion of
the premium capitalized each year on the date on which the redemption date falls. The annual yield is
the annual rate which, on the subscription or acquisition date, equals, at that rate and on a compound
interest basis, the current value of the amounts to be paid and the amounts to be received.

_Capital gains._ Disposals of the Notes give rise to a gain or loss to be included in taxable income.
The amount of the gain or loss is equal to the difference between (i) the disposal price reduced, as the
case may be, by the amounts of redemption premium already taxed in accordance with Article 238
septies E of the French tax code and not yet received and (ii) the subscription or acquisition price of
the Notes. Such amount is included in the results subject to corporate tax at the rate of 33.33% (or,
within the limit of A38,120 for every 12-month period, at a rate of 15% for companies that fulfill the
conditions described above). Where applicable, the social contribution of 3.3% and, for fiscal years
between December 31, 2011 and December 30, 2016, the 10.7% temporary exceptional contribution,
are to be added in accordance with the conditions mentioned above.

**_Non-Residents of France for Tax Purposes Holding Notes_**

Individual holders of the Notes which are not resident in France for tax purposes will not be
subject to French taxation on any income derived from the Notes, including receipt of interest income,
redemption premium paid, if any, and income from a sale of Notes, assuming the Notes are not
deposited in France.

Notwithstanding the above, Notes acquired by way of inheritance or gift by an individual who is a
French resident for tax purposes will be subject to French inheritance and gift duties, subject to the
application of double taxation treaties signed by France with certain countries regarding gift and
inheritance duties.

A corporate holder of the Notes who is not a resident in France for tax purposes and has no
permanent establishment in France to which the Notes are attributable will not be subject to any
French taxation on income derived from the Notes, including receipt of interest income, redemption
premium paid, if any, and income from a sale of Notes.

**Spanish Taxation**

**_Introduction_**

This section does not purport to deal with all aspects of Spanish taxation that relate to an
investment in Notes or that may be relevant to particular investors in light of their personal
circumstances. If you are considering buying Notes, you should consult your own tax advisor concerning
the tax consequences of holding the Notes in your particular situation.

**_Taxation of Payments under the Guarantees Made by a Spanish Resident Guarantor_**

In the event that any payments of principal or interest are made under the Guarantees by Spanish
resident Guarantors, these may be characterized by the Spanish tax authorities as an indemnity and,
accordingly, may be made free and clear of withholding or deduction of any taxes, duties, assessments
or governmental charges of any nature whatsoever which may be imposed, levied, collected, withheld or
assessed by the Kingdom of Spain or any political subdivision or authority thereof or therein having
power to tax.

However, the Spanish tax authorities may take the view that a Guarantor resident in Spain has
validly, legally and effectively assumed (whether contractually or by any other means) all of the
obligations of the Issuer under the Notes, subject to and in accordance with the Guarantee of such
Guarantor. In such a case, the Spanish tax authorities may treat part of the payments made by such
Guarantor to the holders of the Notes under such Guarantee as Spanish source interest and attempt to
impose withholding tax at the current rate of 19% on the payments by such Guarantor on the Notes.

In the event that part of the payments made by a Spanish Guarantor are treated by the Spanish
tax authorities as Spanish source interest, no withholding would apply for the following types of holders
of the Notes: (i) holders that are resident for tax purposes in a Member State other than Spain, and
that are not acting through countries or territories considered as tax havens pursuant to Royal

209


-----

Decree 1080/1991 of July 5, 1991; (ii) holders that pay corporate income tax in Spain; and (iii) holders
that are non-residents of Spain acting through a permanent establishment in Spain.

In the case of (i) above, for withholding to be avoided, the holder must provide to the applicable
Spanish Guarantor a certificate of residence issued by the tax authorities of the jurisdiction in which
the holder resides, prior to any payment, and such certificate must be valid for one year from issuance.
In the cases of (ii) and (iii) above, the Paying Agent must be provided with a list of those investors
who are, as the case may be, Spanish corporate income taxpayers or non-residents of Spain acting
through a permanent establishment in Spain, together with their name, address, tax identification
number, ISIN code of the Notes, principal amount of Notes held at each interest payment date, gross
income and amount withheld.

Additionally, such withholding tax, if any, may be reduced or eliminated under an applicable
income tax treaty to which the Kingdom of Spain is a party. The applicability of a reduced tax rate or
exemption shall be evidenced by the appropriate document as set forth in the order, if any,
implementing the applicable tax treaty.

Prospective investors should be aware that in the event that a Spanish-resident Guarantor
reasonably and timely requests Noteholders to supply such information as may be necessary in order to
allow such Guarantor to make payments under the relevant Guarantee free and clear of withholding
taxes, and such Noteholder fails to do so, such Guarantor may not be required to pay Additional
Amounts to such Noteholder. See ‘‘Description of the Notes—Additional Amounts’’ and ‘‘Risk
Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and Our Structure—If Spanish tax authorities determine that
interest payments that any Spanish Guarantor makes should be treated as Spanish source income,
withholding rules could apply and we could be required to gross-up any such payments for the amount
of any required withholding.’’

**_Income Taxation of Spanish Resident Noteholders_**

Interest payments and capital gains realized by individual holders of the Notes who are resident
for tax purposes in Spain will be subject to taxation at the fixed tax rate of 23% (though a 19% tax rate
will apply to the first A6,000, and a 21% flat rate will apply to the next bracket between A6,001 and
A50,000). Should any withholding tax be applied, taxation may be reduced or eliminated upon
application of the corresponding provisions.

Interest payments and capital gains realized by corporate holders of the Notes that are resident for
tax purposes in Spain and subject to the regular provisions of the Spanish Corporate Income Tax Act or
non-resident for tax purposes in Spain and that are holders acting through a permanent establishment
in the Spanish territory to which such income is attributable, will be subject to taxation at the standard
Spanish corporate income tax rate, which is 25%. Should any withholding tax be applied, taxation may
be reduced or eliminated upon application of the corresponding provisions.

**_Other Taxes_**

_Net Wealth Tax_

Holders of Notes who are individuals resident for tax purposes in Spain will be subject to net
wealth tax in 2016 in accordance with the rules set forth by Spanish law, whereas holders who are
non-resident for tax purposes in Spain will not be subject to net wealth tax to the extent that the Notes
are not deemed to be located, exercisable or enforceable in the Spanish territory. Finally, even if the
Notes are located, exercisable or enforceable in the Spanish territory, an exemption of this tax applies
to holders that are individuals resident in any country of the European Union who are entitled to the
aforementioned exemption on the income derived from the Notes.

Corporate holders of the Notes, either resident or non-resident for tax purposes in Spain, are not
subject to this tax.

_Inheritance and Gift Tax_

Notes acquired by individuals who are resident for tax purposes in Spain by way of inheritance or
gift will be subject to inheritance and gift tax in accordance with the rules set forth by Spanish Law.

210


-----

Notes acquired by corporations that are resident for tax purposes in Spain by way of inheritance or
gift will not be subject to inheritance and gift tax but to corporate income tax.

Notes acquired by any non-resident for tax purposes in Spain by way of inheritance or gift will not
be subject to inheritance and gift tax to the extent that the Notes are not deemed to be located,
exercisable or enforceable in the Spanish territory.

**_Other tax considerations_**

Notes held by Spanish resident holders deposited or managed by non-resident entities are subject
to the general obligation to disclose information regarding assets located outside Spain and must file
tax form 720 (Obligaci´on de declaraci´on sobre bienes y derechos situados en el extranjero).

211

**CERTAIN ERISA CONSIDERATIONS**

**General**

The U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (‘‘ERISA’’) imposes certain
requirements on employee benefit plans subject to Title I of ERISA and on entities that are deemed to
hold the assets of such plans (‘‘ERISA Plans’’), and on those persons who are fiduciaries with respect
to ERISA Plans. Investments by ERISA Plans are subject to ERISA’s general fiduciary requirements,
including, but not limited to, the requirement of investment prudence and diversification and the
requirement that an ERISA Plan’s investments be made in accordance with the documents governing
the plan.

Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit certain transactions involving the
assets of an ERISA Plan (as well as those plans that are not subject to ERISA but which are subject to
Section 4975 of the Code, such as individual retirement accounts (together with ERISA Plans,
‘‘Plans’’)) and certain persons (referred to as ‘‘parties in interest’’ or ‘‘disqualified persons’’) having
certain relationships to such Plans, unless a statutory or administrative exemption is applicable to the
transaction. A party in interest or disqualified person who engages in a prohibited transaction may be
subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code.

Any Plan fiduciary which proposes to cause a Plan to purchase the Notes should consult with its
counsel regarding the applicability of the fiduciary responsibility and prohibited transaction provisions
of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code to such an investment, and to confirm that such purchase and
holding will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction or any other violation of an
applicable requirement of ERISA.

Non-U.S. plans, governmental plans and certain church plans, while not subject to the fiduciary
responsibility provisions of ERISA or the prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and Section 4975
of the Code, may nevertheless be subject to non-U.S., state, local or other federal laws or regulations
that are substantially similar to the foregoing provisions of ERISA and the Code (‘‘Similar Law’’).
Fiduciaries of any such plans should consult with their counsel before purchasing the Notes to
determine the need for, and the availability, if necessary, of any exemptive relief under any such law or
regulations.

**Prohibited Transaction Exemptions**

The fiduciary of a Plan that proposes to purchase and hold any Notes should consider, among
other things, whether such purchase and holding may involve: (i) the direct or indirect extension of
credit to a party in interest or a disqualified person; (ii) the sale or exchange of any property between a
Plan and a party in interest or a disqualified person; or (iii) the transfer to, or use by or for the benefit
of, a party in interest or disqualified person, of any Plan assets. Such parties in interest or disqualified
persons could include, without limitation, the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee, the Transfer
Agent and Paying Agent, the Luxembourg Transfer Agent, Registrar and Listing Agent or any of their
respective affiliates. Depending on the satisfaction of certain conditions which may include the identity
of the Plan fiduciary making the decision to acquire or hold the Notes on behalf of a Plan,
Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code or Prohibited Transaction Class
Exemption (‘‘PTCE’’) 84-14 (relating to transactions effected by a ‘‘qualified professional asset
manager’’), PTCE 90-1 (relating to investments by insurance company pooled separate accounts),
PTCE 91-38 (relating to investments by bank collective investment funds), PTCE 95-60 (relating to
investments by insurance company general accounts) or PTCE 96-23 (relating to transactions directed
by an in-house asset manager) (collectively, the ‘‘Class Exemptions’’) could provide an exemption from
the prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code. However, there can be
no assurance that any of these Class Exemptions or any other exemption will be available with respect
to any particular transaction involving the Notes.

By its purchase of any Note, the purchaser and any subsequent transferee thereof will be deemed
to have represented and warranted that either: (i) no portion of the assets used by such purchaser or
transferee to acquire and hold the Notes constitutes assets of any Plan or non-U.S., governmental or
church plan subject to Similar Law or any entity whose underlying assets are considered to include
‘‘plan assets’’ of any such plan, account or arrangement; or (ii) the purchase and holding of the Notes
by such purchaser or transferee will not constitute a non-exempt prohibited transaction under
Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or a violation under any applicable Similar Law.

**Each Plan fiduciary (and each fiduciary for non-U.S., governmental or church plans subject to**
**Similar Law) should consult with its legal advisor concerning the potential consequences to the plan**
**under ERISA, the Code or such Similar Laws of an investment in the Notes.**

212


-----

**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**

The Issuer, the Guarantors and the Initial Purchasers have entered into a purchase agreement (the
‘‘Purchase Agreement’’), dated July 22, 2016 with respect to the Notes. Subject to certain conditions
contained in the purchase agreement, the Initial Purchasers have agreed to purchase, and the Issuer
has agreed to sell, all of the Notes (excluding, for purposes of this section, the Exchange Notes).

The purchase agreement with respect to the Notes provides that the obligations of the Initial
Purchasers to purchase and accept delivery of the Notes are subject to the approval by their counsel of
certain legal matters and to certain other conditions.

None of the Issuer, the Guarantors or any of their subsidiaries will for a period of 180 days after
the date of this Offering Memorandum, without the prior written consent of Deutsche Bank AG,
London Branch, offer, sell or contract to sell, or otherwise dispose of (or enter into any transaction
which is designed to, or might reasonably be expected to, result in the disposition of (whether by actual
disposition or effective economic disposition due to cash settlement or otherwise) by the Issuer) any
debt securities similar to the Notes.

The purchase prices for the Notes are the initial offering prices set forth on the cover page of this
Offering Memorandum less an initial purchaser discount. The Initial Purchasers propose to offer the
Notes at the initial offering prices. After the Notes are released for sale, the Initial Purchasers may
change the offering price and other selling terms.

The Notes have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act. The Initial
Purchasers have agreed that they will only offer or sell the Notes (i) outside the United States in
offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act and (ii) in the United
States to QIBs in reliance on Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act. The terms used above have the
meanings given to them by Regulation S and Rule 144A.

In connection with the sales outside the United States, the Initial Purchasers have agreed that they
will not offer, sell or deliver the Notes to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons (i) as part of
the Initial Purchasers’ distribution at any time or (ii) otherwise until 40 days after the later of the
commencement of the Offerings or the date the Notes were originally issued. The Initial Purchasers
will send to each dealer to whom they sell such Notes during such 40-day period a confirmation or
other notice setting forth the restrictions on offers and sales of the Notes within the United States by a
dealer or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons.

In addition, until 40 days after the commencement of the Offerings, an offer or sale of any Notes
within the United States by any dealer (whether or not participating in the Offerings) may violate the
registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act if such offer or sale is made otherwise than in
accordance with Rule 144A or pursuant to another exemption from registration under the U.S.
Securities Act.

The Notes are a new issue of securities for which there currently is no market. We have applied,
through our listing agent, to list the Notes on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and
trade the Notes on the Euro MTF market, however, we cannot assure you that the Notes will be
approved for listing or that such listing will be maintained.

The Initial Purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market in the Notes as
permitted by applicable law. The Initial Purchasers are not obligated, however, to make a market in the
Notes, and any market-making activity may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the
Initial Purchaser without notice. In addition, any such market-making activity will be subject to the
limits imposed by the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the ‘‘U.S. Exchange Act’’).
Accordingly, we cannot assure you that any market for the Notes will develop, that it will be liquid if it
does develop, or that you will be able to sell any Notes at a particular time or at a price which will be
favorable to you. See ‘‘Risk factors—Risks Related to the Notes and Our Structure—There is no
existing public trading market for the Notes and the ability to transfer them is limited, which may
adversely affect the value of the Notes.’’

Delivery of the Notes will be made against payment therefor on or about the third London
business day following the date of pricing of the Notes (such settlement being referred to as ‘‘T+3’’).

In connection with the Offerings, Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch (or persons acting on its
behalf) may purchase and sell Notes in the open market. These transactions may include short sales,

213


-----

stabilizing transactions and purchases to cover positions created by short sales. Short sales involve the
sale by Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch of a greater number of Notes than it is required to
purchase in the Offerings.

Stabilizing transactions consist of certain bids or purchases made for the purpose of preventing or
retarding a decline in the market price of the Notes while the Offerings are in progress.

These activities by Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch (or persons acting on its behalf) may
stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the market price of the Notes. As a result, the price of the Notes
may be higher than the price that otherwise might exist in the open market. If these activities are
commenced, they may be discontinued by Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch at any time and must
end no later than the earlier of 30 days after the Issue Date and 60 days after the date of the allotment
of the Notes. These transactions may be effected in the over-the-counter market or otherwise.

In relation to each Relevant Member State, with effect from and including the date on which the
Prospectus Directive is implemented in that Relevant Member State, the offer is not being made and
will not be made to the public of any Notes which are the subject of the Offerings contemplated by this
Offering Memorandum in that Relevant Member State, other than:

(a) to any legal entity that is a ‘‘qualified investor’’ as defined in the Prospectus Directive;

(b) to 150 natural or legal persons (other than ‘‘qualified investors’’ as defined in the
Prospectus Directive), as permitted under the Prospectus Directive; or

(c) in any other circumstances falling within Article 3(2) of the Prospectus Directive,

_provided that no such offer of the Notes shall require us or the Initial Purchasers to publish a_
prospectus pursuant to Article 3 of the Prospectus Directive.

Each of the Initial Purchasers represents and warrants that:

(a) it has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or
cause to be communicated an invitation or inducement to engage an investment activity (within the
meaning of Section 21 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the ‘‘FSMA’’)) received by
it in connection with the issuance or sale of the Notes in circumstances in which Section 21(1) of
the FSMA does not apply to the Issuer; and

(b) it has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect
to anything done by it in relation to the Notes in, from or otherwise involving the United
Kingdom.

No action has been taken in any jurisdiction, including the United States, by us or the Initial
Purchasers that would permit a public offering of the Notes or the possession, circulation or
distribution of this Offering Memorandum or any other material relating to us or the Notes in any
jurisdiction where action for this purpose is required. Accordingly, the Notes may not be offered or
sold, directly or indirectly, and neither this Offering Memorandum nor any other offering material or
advertisements in connection with the Notes may be distributed or published, in or from any country or
jurisdiction, except in compliance with any applicable rules and regulations of any such country or
jurisdiction. This Offering Memorandum does not constitute an offer to purchase or a solicitation of an
offer to sell in any jurisdiction where such offer or solicitation would be unlawful. Persons into whose
possession this Offering Memorandum comes are advised to inform themselves about and to observe
any restrictions relating to the Offerings, the distribution of this Offering Memorandum and resale of
the Notes. See ‘‘Notice to Investors.’’

The Issuer has agreed to indemnify the Initial Purchasers against certain liabilities, including
liabilities under the U.S. Securities Act. The Issuer will pay the fees and expenses related to the
Offerings.

UniCredit, acting as an Initial Purchaser in connection with the Offerings, is a shareholder of the
Issuer. The Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates acted as initial purchasers of the Existing
Notes and received customary fees for such transaction. From time to time, the Initial Purchasers and
their affiliates have provided, and may in the future provide, investment banking, commercial banking,
financial advisory and other services to us and our affiliates for which they have received or may
receive customary fees and commissions. In addition, each of the Initial Purchasers or certain of their
affiliates is a lender under our New Revolving Credit Facility that the Issuer will enter into as borrower

214


-----

in connection with the Refinancing, and will receive customary fees for their services in such capacities.
Moreover, Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse are acting as dealer managers in connection with the
Exchange Offer. In addition, Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch and certain affiliates of Deutsche
Bank AG, London Branch will also act as Trustee, paying agent, transfer agent, listing agent and
Security Trustee for the Notes, the New Revolving Credit Facility and the Intercreditor Agreement and
as exchange agent in respect of the Exchange Offer. Certain affiliates of each of the Initial Purchasers
are also lenders under the Issuer’s Existing Credit Facilities which are being cancelled in connection
with the Refinancing.

**NOTICE TO INVESTORS**

**General**

The Notes and the Guarantees have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities
Act or any state securities laws and, therefore, the Notes may not be offered or sold within the United
States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons except pursuant to an exemption from, or in
a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and applicable
state securities laws. Accordingly, the Notes are only to be offered and sold to:

  - ‘‘qualified institutional buyers,’’ or ‘‘QIBs’’ in compliance with Rule 144A; and

  - non-U.S. persons in offshore transactions outside the United States in reliance upon
Regulation S.

We use the terms ‘‘offshore transaction,’’ ‘‘U.S. person’’ and ‘‘United States’’ with the meanings
given to them in Regulation S.

**Important Information about the Offerings**

If you purchase Notes, you will be deemed to have represented and agreed as follows:

(1) You understand and acknowledge that the Notes and the Guarantees have not been registered
under the U.S. Securities Act or any other applicable securities laws and that the Notes are
being offered for resale in transactions not requiring registration under the U.S. Securities Act
or any other securities laws, including sales pursuant to Rule 144A, and, unless so registered,
may not be offered, sold or otherwise transferred except in compliance with the registration
requirements of the U.S. Securities Act or any other applicable securities laws, pursuant to an
exemption therefrom, or in a transaction not subject thereto, and in each case in compliance
with the conditions for transfer set forth in paragraph (4) below.

(2) You are not our ‘‘affiliate’’ (as defined in Rule 144 under the U.S. Securities Act), you are not
acting on our behalf and you are either:

(a) a QIB and are aware that any sale of the Notes to you will be made in reliance on
Rule 144A, and such acquisition will be for your own account or for the account of
another QIB; or

(b) not a ‘‘U.S. person’’ or purchasing for the account or benefit of a U.S. person (other than
a distributor), and you are purchasing notes in an offshore transaction in accordance with
Regulation S.

person has made any representation to you with respect to us or the offer or sale of any of
the Notes, other than the information contained in this Offering Memorandum, which
Offering Memorandum has been delivered to you and upon which you are relying in making
your investment decision with respect to the Notes. You acknowledge that no person other
than the Issuer makes any representation or warranty as to the accuracy or completeness of
this Offering Memorandum. You have had access to such financial and other information
concerning us and the Notes, including an opportunity to ask questions of, and request
information from, us and the Initial Purchasers.

(4) You are purchasing Notes for your own account, or for one or more investor accounts for
which you are acting as a fiduciary or agent, in each case for investment, and not with a view
to, or for offer or sale in connection with, any distribution thereof in violation of the U.S.
Securities Act, subject to any requirement of law that the disposition of your property or the
property of such investor account or accounts be at all times within your or their control and
subject to your or their ability to resell such Notes pursuant to Rule 144A, Regulation S or
any other available exemption from registration available under the U.S. Securities Act. You
agree on your own behalf and on behalf of any investor account for which you are purchasing
the Notes, and each subsequent holder of the Notes by its acceptance thereof will agree, to
offer, sell or otherwise transfer such Notes prior to (x) the date which is one year (in the case
of Rule 144A Notes) or 40 days (in the case of Regulation S Notes) after the later of the date
of the original issue of the Notes and the last date on which the Issuer or any of its affiliates

216


-----

was the owner of such Notes (or any predecessor thereto) or (y) such later date, if any, as
may be required by applicable law (the ‘‘Resale Restriction Termination Date’’) only:

(a) to us;

(b) pursuant to a registration statement which has been declared effective under the U.S.
Securities Act;

(c) for so long as the Notes are eligible for resale pursuant to Rule 144A, to a person you
reasonably believe is a QIB that purchases for its own account or for the account of

Rule 144A;

(d) pursuant to offshore transactions to non-U.S. persons occurring outside the United States
within the meaning of Regulation S in reliance on Regulation S; or

subject, in each of the foregoing cases, to any requirement of law that the disposition of the
seller’s property or the property of an investor account or accounts be within the seller’s or
account’s control, and in compliance with any applicable state securities laws.

You acknowledge that the Issuer, the relevant Trustee, the applicable Registrar and the
applicable Transfer Agent reserve the right prior to any offer, sale or other transfer of the
relevant Notes (i) pursuant to clause (d) or clause (e) above prior to the Resale Restriction
Termination Date of the Notes to require the delivery of an opinion of counsel, certifications
and/or other information satisfactory to us, the relevant Trustee, the applicable Registrar and
the applicable Transfer Agent, and (ii) in each of the foregoing cases, to require that a
certificate of transfer in the form appearing on the reverse of the security is completed and
delivered by the transferor to the trustee. The foregoing restrictions on resale will not apply
subsequent to the Resale Restriction Termination Date.

Each purchaser acknowledges that each Global Note will contain a legend substantially in the
following form:

‘‘THIS NOTE HAS NOT BEEN AND WILL NOT BE REGISTERED UNDER THE U.S.
SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE ‘‘U.S. SECURITIES ACT’’), OR

REASONABLY BELIEVES IS A ‘‘QUALIFIED INSTITUTIONAL BUYER’’ AS DEFINED
IN RULE 144A UNDER THE U.S. SECURITIES ACT THAT PURCHASES FOR ITS
OWN ACCOUNT OR FOR THE ACCOUNT OF A QUALIFIED INSTITUTIONAL
BUYER TO WHOM NOTICE IS GIVEN THAT THE TRANSFER IS BEING MADE IN
RELIANCE ON RULE 144A UNDER THE U.S. SECURITIES ACT, (D) PURSUANT TO
OFFERS AND SALES TO NON-U.S. PERSONS THAT OCCUR OUTSIDE THE UNITED
STATES IN COMPLIANCE WITH REGULATION S UNDER THE U.S. SECURITIES
ACT OR (E) PURSUANT TO ANY OTHER AVAILABLE EXEMPTION FROM THE
REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF THE U.S. SECURITIES ACT, AND (3) AGREES
THAT IT WILL GIVE TO EACH PERSON TO WHOM THIS NOTE IS TRANSFERRED
A NOTICE SUBSTANTIALLY TO THE EFFECT OF THIS LEGEND; SUBJECT IN
EACH OF THE FOREGOING CASES TO ANY REQUIREMENT OF LAW THAT THE
DISPOSITION OF ITS PROPERTY OR THE PROPERTY OF SUCH INVESTOR
ACCOUNT OR ACCOUNTS BE AT ALL TIMES WITHIN ITS OR THEIR CONTROL
AND IN COMPLIANCE WITH ANY APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS AND
ANY APPLICABLE LOCAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS AND FURTHER SUBJECT
TO THE ISSUER’S AND THE TRUSTEE’S RIGHTS PRIOR TO ANY SUCH OFFER,

DELIVERY OF AN OPINION OF COUNSEL, CERTIFICATION AND/OR OTHER
INFORMATION SATISFACTORY TO EACH OF THEM AND (II) IN EACH OF THE
FOREGOING CASES, TO REQUIRE THAT A CERTIFICATE OF TRANSFER IN THE
FORM APPEARING ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS NOTE IS COMPLETED AND
DELIVERED BY THE TRANSFEROR TO THE TRUSTEE.’’

If you purchase Notes, you will also be deemed to acknowledge that the foregoing restrictions
apply to holders of beneficial interests in the Notes as well as to holders of the Notes.

(5) You acknowledge that the Registrar will not be required to accept for registration of transfer
any Notes acquired by you, except upon presentation of evidence satisfactory to us and the
Registrar that the restrictions set forth herein have been complied with.

(6) You acknowledge that:

(a) the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers and others will rely upon the truth and accuracy of your
acknowledgements, representations and agreements set forth herein, and you agree that,
if any of your acknowledgements, representations or agreements herein cease to be
accurate and complete, you will notify us and the Initial Purchasers promptly in writing;
and

(b) if you are acquiring any Notes as fiduciary or agent for one or more investor accounts,
you represent with respect to each such account that:

(i) you have sole investment discretion; and

(ii) you have full power to make the foregoing acknowledgements, representations and
agreements.

(7) You agree that you will, and each subsequent holder is required to, give to each person to
whom you transfer the Notes notice of any restrictions on the transfer of the Notes, if then
applicable.

(8) If you are a purchaser in a sale that occurs outside the United States within the meaning of
Regulation S, you acknowledge that until the expiration of the ‘‘distribution compliance
period’’ (as defined below), you shall not make any offer or sale of the Notes to a U.S. person
or for the account or benefit of a U.S. person within the meaning of Rule 902 under the U.S.
Securities Act. The ‘‘distribution compliance period’’ means the 40-day period following the
Issue Date.

(9) You acknowledge that until 40 days after the commencement of the relevant Offering, any
offer or sale of the relevant Notes within the United States by a dealer (whether or not
participating in the Offerings) may violate the registration requirements of the Securities Act
if such offer or sale is made otherwise than in accordance with Rule 144A under the U.S.
Securities Act.

218


-----

(10) You understand that no action has been taken in any jurisdiction (including the United States)
by the Issuer or the Initial Purchasers that would permit a public offering of the Notes or the
possession, circulation or distribution of this Offering Memorandum or any other material
relating to the Issuer or the Notes in any jurisdiction where action for that purpose is
required. Consequently, any transfer of the Notes will be subject to the selling restrictions set
forth in this section of the Offering Memorandum and/or in the front of the Offering
Memorandum under ‘‘Notice to Certain European Investors,’’ and ‘‘Plan of Distribution.’’

(11) Each purchaser and subsequent transferee of a Note will be deemed to have represented and
warranted that either (i) no portion of the assets used by such purchaser or transferee to
acquire and hold the Notes constitutes assets of any employee benefit plan subject to Title I
of ERISA, any plan, individual retirement account or other arrangement subject to
Section 4975 of the Code or provisions under any federal, state, local, non-U.S. or other laws
or regulations that are similar to such provisions of Similar Law, or any entity whose
underlying assets are considered to include ‘‘plan assets’’ of any such plan or account, or
(ii) the purchase and holding of the Notes will not constitute a non-exempt prohibited
transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or a violation under any
applicable Similar Law.

**SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL LIABILITIES**

**Luxembourg**

The Issuer and Sub Lecta S.A. are incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg and all of the
directors and executive officers of the Issuer (or certain other persons named in this Offering
Memorandum) and Sub Lecta S.A. are non-residents of the United States. Furthermore, a substantial
portion of the assets of the Issuer and Sub Lecta S.A. and a substantial portion of the assets of such
persons are located outside the United States. As a result, it may not be possible for investors to effect
service of process within the United States upon those persons, the Issuer or Sub Lecta S.A., or to
enforce against them judgments of U.S. courts predicated upon the civil liability provisions of U.S.
federal or state securities laws.

We have been advised by our Luxembourg counsel that the United States and Luxembourg are not
currently bound by a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other
than arbitral awards rendered in civil and commercial matters. According to such counsel, an
enforceable judgment for the payment of monies rendered by any U.S. Federal or state court based on
civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon the U.S. securities laws, would not directly be
enforceable in Luxembourg. However, a party who received such favorable judgment in a U.S. court
may initiate enforcement proceedings in Luxembourg (exequatur) by requesting enforcement of the U.S.
judgment by the District Court (Tribunal d’Arrondissement) pursuant to Section 678 of the New
Luxembourg Code of Civil Procedure. The District Court will authorize the enforcement in
Luxembourg of the U.S. judgment if it is satisfied that all of the following conditions are met:

  - the U.S. judgment is enforceable (ex´ecutoire) in the United States;

  - the U.S. court awarding the judgment had jurisdiction to adjudicate the respective matter
according to Luxembourg private international law rules and, in particular, that Luxembourg
courts had not exclusive jurisdiction over the respective matter;

  - the U.S. judgment does not contravene international public policy as understood under the
laws of Luxembourg;

  - the U.S. court has acted in accordance with its own procedural laws and has applied to the
dispute the substantive law which would have been applied by Luxembourg courts;

  - the principles of fair trial and due process have been complied with and in particular, the U.S.
judgment was granted following proceedings where the counterparty had the opportunity to
appear, and if it appeared, to present a defense;

  - the U.S. judgment has not been obtained fraudulently; and

  - the U.S. judgment is not irreconciliable with another judgment enforceable in Luxembourg in
relation to the same dispute or a similar dispute.

Subject to the above conditions, Luxembourg courts tend not to review the merits of a foreign
judgment, although there is no statutory prohibition.

We have also been advised by our Luxembourg counsel that if an original action is brought in
Luxembourg, Luxembourg courts may refuse to apply the designated law (i) if the choice of such law
was not made bona fide and (ii) if its application contravenes Luxembourg public policy or is manifestly
incompatible with Luxembourg international policy rules. In an action brought in Luxembourg on the
basis of U.S. federal or state securities laws, Luxembourg courts may not have the requisite power to
grant the remedies sought. Also, an exequatur may be refused in respect of punitive damages.

Furthermore, in the event of any proceedings being brought in a Luxembourg court in respect of a
monetary obligation expressed to be payable in a currency other than euro, a Luxembourg court would
have power to give judgment expressed as an order to pay a currency other than euro. However,
enforcement of the judgment against any party in Luxembourg would be available only in euro and for
such purposes all claims or debts would be converted into euro.

In addition, certain other Guarantors are entities organized under the laws of Italy, Spain or
France.

220


-----

**Italy**

The Guarantors organized under Italian law, Garda and Polyedra, are companies with limited
liability. All of their directors and executive officers are non-residents of the United States. In addition,
all of their assets and substantially all of the assets of their directors and executive officers are located
outside the United States. As a result, you may not be able to effect service of process within the
United of States upon Garda and Polyedra or their directors and executive officers or to enforce a
judgment obtained against them or their directors and executive officers in foreign courts predicated
solely upon the civil liability provisions of U.S. securities laws.

We have been advised by our Italian counsel that the recognition and enforcement of a judgment
rendered by a U.S. federal or state court in the Republic of Italy is governed by Article 64 of the
Private International Law Act (i.e., Law 218 of May 31, 1995) (the ‘‘PIL Act’’) (and certain other
provisions of the PIL Act). Pursuant to the PIL Act, any judgment issued by a U.S. federal or state
court should automatically be recognized in the Republic of Italy provided that the following
requirements are met:

  - the relevant U.S. federal or state court had appropriate jurisdiction to pass judgment upon the
matter (in accordance with the Italian law rules on jurisdiction);

  - the defendant had received the summons in accordance with the laws of the state in which the
proceedings have taken place, and the defendant had not been deprived of his fundamental
right to a defense;

  - the parties had appeared in the proceedings in accordance with the local procedural law, or
the proceedings were conducted in absentia (in contumacia) in accordance with such local
procedural law;

  - the judgment rendered by the U.S. federal or state court must be final and binding (passato in
_giudicato) according to the law of the state in which it was issued;_

  - the judgment rendered by the U.S. federal or state court is not in conflict with any earlier
final and binding judgment issued by an Italian court;

  - there is no pending proceeding before any Italian court in relation to the same subject matter
and between the same parties which started prior to the commencement of the proceedings
before the relevant U.S. federal or state court; and

  - the judgment rendered by the U.S. federal or a state court is not contrary to Italian public
policy.

In addition, according to Article 67 of the PIL Act, if a judgment rendered by a U.S. federal or
state court is not complied with, its recognition is challenged or it is necessary to enforce such
judgment, a proceeding must be instituted in the competent Court of Appeal in the Republic of Italy to
that end. The competent Court of Appeal does not consider the merits of the case but reviews
exclusively the existence of all the requirements set out above (including requiring that the judgment
rendered by the U.S. federal or state court is not contrary to public policy in Italy).

**Spain**

The Guarantors organized under Spanish law are companies with limited liability. All of the
directors and executive officers of the Spanish Guarantors are non-residents of the United States. In
addition, all of the assets of the Spanish Guarantors and substantially all of the assets of the directors
and executive officers of the Spanish Guarantors are located outside the United States. As a result, you
may not be able to effect service of process within the United States upon any of the Spanish
Guarantors or their directors and executive officers or to enforce a judgment obtained against any of
the Spanish Guarantors or their directors and executive officers in foreign courts predicated solely
upon the civil liability provisions of U.S. securities laws. Furthermore, we have been advised by our
Spanish counsel that there is doubt as to whether a lawsuit based upon U.S. federal or state securities
laws could be brought in an original action in Spain and whether a judgment obtained in a U.S. court
based upon U.S. securities laws would be enforced in Spain.

221


-----

**France**

The following summary with respect to the enforceability of certain U.S. court judgments in France
is based upon advice provided to us by French legal advisors. The United States and France are not
party to a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than
arbitration awards rendered in civil and commercial matters. Accordingly, a judgment rendered by any
U.S. federal or state court based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal or
state securities laws, enforceable in the United States, would not be directly recognized or enforceable
in France. A party in whose favor such judgment was rendered could initiate enforcement proceedings
(exequatur) in France before the relevant civil court (Tribunal de Grande Instance) having jurisdiction.
Enforcement in France of such U.S. judgment could be obtained following proper (i.e., non-ex parte)
proceedings if the civil court is satisfied that the following conditions have been met (which conditions,
under prevailing French case law, do not include a review by the French court of the merits of the
foreign judgment):

  - the judgment concerned is enforceable in the United States;

  - such U.S. judgment was rendered by a court having jurisdiction over the matter in accordance
with French rules of international conflicts of jurisdiction (including, without limitation,
whether the dispute is clearly connected to the United States), the French courts did not have
exclusive jurisdiction over the matter and the dispute was sufficiently connected to the
jurisdiction in which the original action was brought;

  - such U.S. judgment does not contravene substantive or procedural rules of French
international public policy (ordre public international);

  - neither the choice of jurisdiction nor the judgment rendered by the foreign court were tainted
by fraud; and

  - such U.S. judgment does not conflict with a French judgment or a foreign judgment which has
become effective in France, in the same matter, and there are no proceedings pending before
French courts at the time enforcement of the judgment is sought and having the same or
similar subject matter as such U.S. judgment.

In addition, the discovery process under actions filed in the United States could be adversely
affected under certain circumstances by French criminal law No. 68-678 of July 26, 1968, as modified by
French law No. 80-538 of July 16, 1980 (relating to the communication of documents and information
of an economic, commercial, industrial, financial or technical nature to foreign authorities or persons),
which could prohibit or restrict obtaining evidence in France or from French persons in connection
with a judicial or administrative U.S. action. Similarly, French data protection rules (law No. 78-17 of
January 6, 1978 on data processing, data files and individual liberties, as modified by law No. 2004-801
of August 6, 2004) can limit under certain circumstances the possibility of obtaining information in
France or from French persons in connection with a judicial or administrative U.S. action in a discovery
context.

Furthermore, if an original action is brought in France, French courts may refuse to apply the
designated law if its application contravenes French rules of conflict (including the law chosen by the
parties to govern their contract) if the application of such law (in the case at hand) is deemed to
contravene: (i) mandatory rules (substantive or procedural) of international public order (ordre public
_international) under French law, (ii) French overriding mandatory provisions (lois de police),_
(iii) overriding mandatory provisions (substantive or procedural) of the laws of a country in which all
other elements relevant to the situation of the relevant agreement or transaction are located, or
(iv) where all other elements relevant to the situation of the relevant agreement or transaction are
located in one or more member States of the European Union, overriding mandatory provisions
(substantive or procedural) of European Union law, as implemented in France and interpreted by
French courts.

Furthermore, if an original action is brought in France, French courts may refuse to apply the
designated law if its application contravenes French public policy.

Furthermore, in an action brought in France on the basis of U.S. federal or state securities laws,
French courts may not have the requisite power to grant all of the remedies sought.

222


-----

Pursuant to articles 14 and 15 of the French Civil Code, a French national (either a company or an
individual) can sue a foreign defendant before French courts (Article 14) and can be sued by a foreign
claimant before French courts (Article 15). While for a long time, case law has interpreted these
provisions as meaning that a French national, either claimant or defendant, could not be forced against
its will to appear before a jurisdiction other than French courts, according to recent case law, the
French courts’ jurisdiction towards French nationals is no longer mandatory to the extent an action has
been commenced before a court in a jurisdiction which has sufficient contact with the litigation and the
choice of jurisdiction is not fraudulent. In addition, the French national may waive its rights to benefit
from the provisions of Articles 14 and 15 of the French Civil Code.

**SELECTED EXPLANATORY NOTES**

**1.** **Basis of preparation and accounting policies**

**1.1. Basis of preparation**

The interim condensed consolidated financial statements of Lecta Group for the three months
ended 31 March 2016 have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting.

The interim condensed consolidated financial statements do not include all the information and
disclosures required in the annual financial statements, and should be read in conjunction with the
Group’s annual consolidated financial statements as at 31 December 2015.

**1.2. Significant accounting policies**

The accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the interim condensed consolidated financial
statements are consistent with those followed in the preparation of the Group’s annual financial
statements for the year ended 31 December 2015.

The following standards and amendments were effective as of 1 January 2016:

– In December 2013, the IASB issued Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2012-2014 Cycle, a
collection of amendments to IFRSs, in response to eight issues addressed during the
2012-2014 cycle. The proposed amendments reflect issues discussed by the IASB in the project
cycle that began in 2012. These amendments meet the criteria for the annual improvements
process set out in the IASB Due Process Handbook. The criteria help in deciding whether a
matter relating to the clarification or correction of IFRSs should be addressed using the
annual improvements process. The proposed effective date for the amendments is for annual
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016, although the IASB proposes that entities would
be permitted to apply them earlier.

**3.1. Lecta capital structure**

On 11 May 2012, Lecta Group successfully refinanced its debt through the issue of
EUR 590 M new notes (‘‘2012 notes’’):

– EUR 390 M of Floating rate senior secured notes due 2018, bearing an interest rate of
3-month Euribor + 5.5%,

– EUR 200 M of Fixed rate senior secured notes due 2019, bearing an interest rate of 8.875%,

Lecta has Board authorization to contemplate liability management transactions, including but not
limited to open market purchases. Lecta is currently reviewing alternatives to refinance some or all of
its outstanding notes, as part of its continuous strategy to maintain a strong financial profile and to
extend the maturity of its indebtedness. There can be no assurance that any such refinancing may occur
in the near future.

**3.2. Projects and plans**

Lecta has Board authorization to explore projects aimed at (i) the simplification of the Group
structure from a corporate and tax standpoint, (ii) the optimization of the operating organization,
(iii) the strengthening of its specialty papers and merchanting operations, and (iv) the identification of
exit opportunities.

**3.3. Organization efficiency program**

The integration process covers Lecta industrial operations in Italy, France and Spain, as well as the
paper merchanting ones in the same countries and, additionally, Portugal.

Within the Organization efficiency program, Lecta planned several cost reduction initiatives.

For the three-month period ended 31 March 2016 the restructuring cash cost associated to Lecta
efficiency programs was EUR (2.1) M (see detailed below), reported in the line ‘‘Non-recurring items’’
(see Note 6). After payments, as at 31 March 2016, the remaining provision for restructuring was
EUR 8.3 M.

**3.3.1. Summary of the cost reduction initiatives since the end of 2012**

The cost reduction initiatives included:

– Agreement with Cartiere del Garda employees to reduce labor cost through the conversion of
part of fixed into variable salary linked to the performance of the company (February 2013);

– Reorganization of the Paper merchanting structure in Italy, Portugal, and Spain with total
headcount reduction of 137 (until March 2013);

– Harmonization of the bonus scheme indexed to EBITDA performance (March 2013),
cancellation of pension fund schemes (May 2013) and mill special agreements (July 2013) in
Spain;

– Permanent closure of Condat production line n�6 (with a production capacity of 130,000 tons
of CWF) with a job position reduction of 139 (June 2013)

– Denunciation of Progil pension regime to active employees in Condat (June 2013); this
denunciation led to a one-off reduction of the provision for defined benefit post- employment
plans of EUR 8.0 M reported in the line ‘‘Labor costs’’ in September 2013;

– Curtailment of the provision for Retirement plan IFC following the implementation of the
restructuring in Condat; the one-off reduction of the provision for defined benefit
post-employment plans of EUR 1.5 M was reported in the line ‘‘Labor costs’’ in September
2013, and EUR 0.2 M in December 2013;

– Denunciation of labor side agreements in Condat (December 2013) related to the working
time and the structure of the remuneration. Condat’s management successfully negotiated with
the unions a new set of labor side agreements designed to promote the company performance,
and the individual and collective efforts. Additional negotiations in the same area are still in
progress.

– Closure of a warehouse in UK with a job reduction position of 4 (September 2013).

– Reorganization of the Paper merchanting structure in Italy and France aiming at centralizing
the management and administration activities, adapting the structure to the reduced size of
the market, outsourcing the transportation activity, reorganizing the logistic services with the
closure of 3 warehouses in December 2013 and 1 in August 2014, associated to a job position

Cash flow hedge is used to cover the exposure to variability in cash flows that is attributable to a
particular risk associated with a forecast transaction.

In Lecta Group, these are foreign currency, interest rate and energy price hedging instruments
(forward, option, cap, floor, collar, swap...). The portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument
that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognized directly in the line ‘‘Net incomes (expenses)
recognized directly through Equity’’ against ‘‘Other receivables’’ or ‘‘Other payables’’. It is removed
from Equity when the hedged item affects the Income statement. The ineffective portion of gain or loss
is immediately recognized in the line ‘‘Non-recurring items’’ of the Income statement (see Note 6).

During the three-month period ended 31 March 2016, there was a Cash flow hedges effect of
EUR 45 K. It consisted of EUR (149) K in relation with the interest rate hedging, and EUR 193 K of
real interest rate hedging payable transferred to Income statement.

**SELECTED EXPLANATORY NOTES — (Continued)**

At 31 March 2016, there were no options on future sales in foreign currencies and on future
purchases in foreign currencies. Therefore, nothing had to be fair valued through Income statement.

**16. Hedging derivatives on interest rates**

_2012 Floating Rate Notes:_

[1] On 3 May 2013, the interest rate of 26% of the Floating rate notes was hedged with a Swap
to exchange 3-month Euribor variable rate against fixed rate of 0.385% for the period from mid-August
2013 to mid-February 2016.

[2] On 24 April 2014, the interest rate of 26% of the Floating rate notes was hedged with a Cap
indexed to 3-month Euribor for the period from mid-August 2014 to mid-August 2016.

[3] On 3 October 2014, the interest rate of 26% of the Floating rate notes was hedged with a Cap
indexed to 3-month Euribor for the period from mid-November 2014 to mid-August 2016.

_Alto Garda Power SrL:_

[4] On 5 September 2007, the interest rate of 50% of the forecast debt in Alto Garda Power SrL
was hedged with a Collar indexed to 6-month Euribor for the period from June 2007 to December
2018.

On 16 March 2010, the interest rate of 25% of the forecast debt was hedged with a Swap to
exchange 6-month Euribor variable rate against fixed rate of 2.995% for the period June 2010 to
December 2018.

In December 2012, Alto Garda Power SrL voluntarily repaid EUR 12 M of its debt. Following this
repayment, the notional amounts of the Collar and the Swap were higher than the debt. Consequently,
the Collar and part of the Swap was considered as hedging instruments, while the balance of the Swap
was no more considered as hedging instrument.

On 18 December 2013, the Swap to exchange 6-month Euribor variable rate was terminated.

_IDAE Sant Joan AIE:_

[5] On 23 July 2010, the interest rate of 75% of the forecast debt in IDAE Sant Joan AIE was
hedged with a Swap to exchange 1-month Euribor variable rate against fixed rate of 2.14% for the
period from June 2011 to March 2016.

[6] On 23 December 2015, the interest rate of 70% of the forecast debt in IDAE Sant Joan AIE
was hedged with a Cap indexed to 3-month Euribor for the period from June 2016 to September 2018.
This Cap took effect 3 months after the termination of the prior interest rates hedge of the forecast
debt in IDAE Sant Joan AIE (See [5]).

The impact of these agreements was accounted for as cash flow hedge.

For the cash flow hedge, the intrinsic value considered as effective was recognized directly in
Equity, while the time value was considered as ineffective and thus recognized in the Income statement.
For the fair value hedge, any gain or loss from re-measuring the hedging instrument at fair value was
recognized in the Income statement in the lines ‘‘Financial income’’ or ‘‘Financial expense’’.

**17. Hedging derivatives on energy prices**

To the Shareholders of
Lecta S.A.

L-2346 Luxembourg

**Report on the consolidated financial statements**

Following our appointment by the General Meeting of the Shareholders dated 27 April 2015, we
have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Lecta S.A., which comprise the
consolidated statement of financial position as at 31 December 2015, the consolidated income
statement, the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the consolidated statement of changes
in equity, the consolidated cash flow statement for the year then ended, and a summary of significant
accounting policies and other explanatory information.

_Board of Directors’ responsibility for the consolidated financial statements_

The Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these
consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as
adopted by the European Union and for such internal control as the Board of Directors determines is
necessary to enable the preparation and presentation of consolidated financial statements that are free
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

_Responsibility of the ‘‘r´eviseur d’entreprises agr´e´e’’_

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our
audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing as adopted for
Luxembourg by the ‘‘Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier’’. Those standards require that
we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether the consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement.

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and
disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the judgement
of the ‘‘r´eviseur d’entreprises agr´e´e’’, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of
the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments,
the ‘‘r´eviseur d’entreprises agr´e´e’’ considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair
presentation of the consolidated financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness
of the entity’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting
policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the Board of Directors, as well
as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a
basis for our audit opinion.

_Opinion_

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial
position of Lecta S.A. as at 31 December 2015, and of its financial performance and its cash flows for
the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the
European Union.

**NOTES**

**1.** **Summary of significant accounting policies**

**1.01. Basis of preparation**

The consolidated financial statements of Lecta Group have been prepared in accordance with the
Standards and Interpretations adopted by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and by
the E.U. applicable as at 1 January 2015. They comprise:

– International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS),

– International Accounting Standards (IAS),

– Interpretations originated by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee
(IFRIC) or the former Standing Interpretations Committee (SIC).

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on an historical cost basis, except for
the measurement at fair value of Available-for-sale financial assets, Biological assets and Derivative
financial instruments. The carrying values of recognized assets and liabilities that are hedged are
adjusted to record changes in the fair values attributable to the hedged risks.

In the process of applying Lecta Group’s accounting policies, the Management has made the
following judgments:

– Each consolidated company has the ability to continue as a going concern.

– Recognition of risks through provisions (see Note 31).

– Choice of an accounting treatment when alternative methods are allowed by existing
standards.

– Choice of an accounting treatment when insufficient guidance is provided by an existing
standard (see Notes 1.16 and 1.17).

Management of Lecta Group has also made assumptions for the years to come.

Where needed Management used assumptions (inflation, interest rates, exchange rates, prices,
volumes...) to develop strategies and prepare plans.

The assumptions and the resulting plans are used in preparing the financial statements
(e.g. computation of impairment tests, recognition of deferred income tax assets...). Actual data may
differ from these assumptions.

**1.02. Changes in accounting policies — New accounting standards**

The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year except for
the following new and amended IAS, IFRS and IFRIC interpretations, effective from 1 January 2015:

– IFRIC 21 Levies — IFRIC 21 is an interpretation of IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities
and Contingent Assets. IAS 37 sets out criteria for the recognition of a liability, one of which
is the requirement for the entity to have a present obligation as a result of a past event
(known as an obligating event). The Interpretation clarifies that the obligating event that gives
rise to a liability to pay a levy is the activity described in the relevant legislation that triggers
the payment of the levy. The group is subject to levies, but the impact of IFRIC 21 is not
material.

– In December 2013, the IASB issued Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2011-2013 Cycle, a
collection of amendments to IFRSs, in response to four issues addressed during the 2011-2013
cycle. The amendments reflect issues discussed by the IASB during the project cycle that
began in 2011, and that were subsequently included in the Exposure Draft of proposed
amendments to IFRSs, Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2011-2013 Cycle. The UE endorsed
them on 17 December 2014. The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on
or after 1 January 2015, although entities are permitted to apply them earlier. These
amendments have no material impact on the Group.

**NOTES — (Continued)**

**1.03. Basis of consolidation**

The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the parent company
Lecta SA and its subsidiaries (including Special Purpose Entities) as at 31 December each year.

Subsidiaries are entities in which Lecta Group has the sole power to exercise control over their
operations.

All the consolidated subsidiaries are listed in Note 2.2.

Certain subsidiaries of Lecta Group are however not consolidated on the basis of immateriality
(see Note 2.3).

Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to Lecta Group and
cease to be consolidated from the date on which Lecta loses control.

Control is achieved when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its
involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the
investee. Specifically, the Group controls an investee if, and only if, the Group has:

– Power over the investee (i.e. existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant
activities of the investee);

– Exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee;

– The ability to use its power over the investee to affect its returns.

Generally, there is a presumption that a majority of voting rights result in control. To support this
presumption and when the Group has less than a majority of the voting or similar rights of an investee,
the Group considers all relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether it has power over an
investee, including:

– The contractual arrangement with the other vote holders of the investee;

– Rights arising from other contractual arrangements;

– The Group’s voting rights and potential voting rights.

All inter-company transactions, balances and unrealized gains and losses on transactions between
Lecta Group companies are eliminated on consolidation. Where local accounting policies followed by
subsidiaries differ significantly from those adopted for the purpose of the consolidated financial
statements, appropriate adjustments are made in order to achieve a consistent basis of accounting.

**1.04. Investment in associates**

An Associate is an entity, including an unincorporated entity such as a partnership, over which
Lecta Group has significant influence but which it does not control. It is neither a subsidiary nor a joint
venture.

An associate is accounted for under the equity method of consolidation. The investment in
associate is initially recognized at cost and adjusted thereafter for the post-acquisition changes in Lecta
Group’s share of net assets of the associate. Goodwill relating to the associate is included in the
carrying amount of the investment and is neither amortized nor individually tested for impairment.

The Income statement of Lecta Group includes Lecta Group’s share of the profit or loss after tax
of the associate.

After application of the equity method, Lecta Group determines whether it is necessary to
recognize an additional impairment loss on the Group’s investment in its associates. Lecta Group
determines at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that the investment in the
associate is impaired. If this is the case, Lecta Group calculates the amount of impairment as the
difference between the recoverable amount of the associate and its carrying value, and recognizes the
amount in the line ‘‘Share of results in associates’’ of the Income statement.

Lecta Group does not consolidate any associate.

**NOTES — (Continued)**

**1.05. Interests in joint ventures**

A Joint venture is a contractual arrangement whereby Lecta Group and one or more third parties
undertake an economic activity that is subject to joint control.

A jointly controlled entity is accounted for under the equity method.

Refer to Note 1.04 for a description on the equity method.

Lecta Group does not have any joint venture, which requires consolidation.

**1.06. Glossary**

_EBITDA:_ Earnings before depreciation, amortization, non-recurring items, finance costs, net
income from associates and income tax. It includes non-cash (expenses) incomes, consisting of
variations of inventories and operating provisions. This aggregate is a key performance indicator for
Lecta Group and the paper industry.

_Non-recurring items:_ Profits, losses or costs isolated for a better understanding of the business
performance. This heading comprises essentially:

– The profit and losses on disposals or impairments of Investment in associates (see Note 1.04),
Available-for-sale financial assets (see Note 1.18), and certain long-lived assets of which
Goodwill (see Note 1.21),

– The costs of restructuring and material reorganization,

– The acquisition costs in relation with business combinations, and the profit following the
immediate recognition of negative goodwill (see Note 1.14).

**1.07. Foreign currency transactions**

The presentation currency of Lecta Group is the euro (EUR).

For each entity of Lecta Group, transactions in foreign currencies are recorded in their functional
currency at the exchange rate prevailing at the transaction date. Monetary assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate prevailing at the year-end closing
date. Exchange differences are taken to the Income statement: Foreign exchange differences for
operating business items are recorded in the line ‘‘Other operating costs except non-recurring items’’,
and financial items are recorded in the lines ‘‘Financial income’’ and ‘‘Financial expense’’.

An exception to the above would be the case of a foreign currency borrowing that would provide a
hedge against a net investment in a foreign entity. Lecta Group does not have such borrowing.

**1.08. Foreign currency translations — subsidiaries**

The Income statements of the non-euro consolidated subsidiaries are translated into euro at the
weighted average exchange rates for the year. Their assets and liabilities are translated into euro at the
exchange rate prevailing at the year-end closing date. The exchange differences are taken directly to
Equity. On disposal of the entity, the exchange differences accumulated are included in the line
‘‘Non-recurring items’’ in the Income statement as a component of the gain or loss on disposal.

Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are stated in the
currency of the acquired entity at the date of the acquisition.

Lecta Group doesn’t have any entity within the group which operates in a hyper-inflationary
economy.

**NOTES — (Continued)**

**1.09. Revenue recognition**

Revenue is recognized to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to
Lecta Group and the revenue can be reliably measured. The following specific recognition criteria must
be met before revenue is recognized:

– Sales of goods: Revenue is recognized when goods leave the warehouses of the Group or
those of the consignees, or when, the goods being ready on the contractual date, their delivery
is postponed following the customer’s request. This method enables a reliable measurement of
revenue. It acknowledges that the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have
been transferred either to the buyer or to the transporter.

– Sales of energy: Revenue is recognized when the energy is effectively supplied to the buyer.

– Interest: Revenue is recognized as interest accrues.

– Dividends: Revenue is recognized when the shareholders’ right to receive the payment is
established.

**1.10. Property, plant and equipment**

Property, plant and equipment purchased by the Lecta Group’s companies are stated at historical
cost, increased where appropriate by terminal environmental reinstatement costs (none in Lecta
Group).

When acquired through a business combination, the assets are stated at their fair value at the date
of acquisition.

The Property, plant and equipment present in Lecta Group at First Time Adoption of IFRS as at
1 January 2004, were subject to specific rules: those of Cartiere del Garda SpA were fair valued and
these fair values were used as deemed cost at that date, while the values of property, plant &
equipment of all other companies used under the previous GAAP were maintained.

At closing date, Property, plant and equipment are stated at the above-mentioned gross value less
accumulated depreciation and any impairment.

Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the following estimated useful lives:

Land . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . No depreciation

Furniture, fixtures and fittings . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5 to 10 years

**1.11. Maintenance**

Maintenance costs relating to an existing tangible asset are capitalized, if and only if it has a useful
life of more than one year and if it replaces an identifiable component of the existing tangible asset.
The cost represents a new component which will be depreciated individually. The depreciation will not
exceed the remaining useful life of the existing tangible asset except when it extends its useful life. This
capitalization also translates into derecognizing the replaced component.

For any given plant, the maintenance of existing Safety and Environment installations may be
necessary to continue to obtain the future economic benefits from the other assets of this plant
dedicated to production. Under such circumstances, they may qualify for recognition as Property, plant
and equipment. Should they not meet the above criteria, these costs are expensed.

F-40


-----

**NOTES — (Continued)**

Recurring maintenance or day-to-day servicing costs (outside contractors, felt & wires...) are always
expensed.

The overhauls of gas turbines of cogeneration plants are capitalized as Property, plant and
equipment and depreciated over 3 to 6 years.

**1.12. Leases**

Leases, which transfer to Lecta Group substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to
ownership of the leased item, are classified as finance leases.

Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset are
classified as operating leases.

_Finance leases are capitalized at the inception of the lease at the fair value of the leased property_
or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments. Lease payments are apportioned
between the finance charges and reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of
interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are included in the line ‘‘Finance
costs’’ of the Income statement. The lease liability is included in the line ‘‘Interest-bearing borrowings’’
of the Statement of financial position.

If there is a reasonable certainty that Lecta Group will obtain ownership by the end of the lease
term, the capitalized leases follow the same depreciation policy than the similar owned assets.
Otherwise, they are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease
term. In both cases, the depreciation is included in the line ‘‘Depreciation’’ of the Income statement.

_Operating lease payments are recognized as an expense in the line ‘‘Other operating costs except_
non-recurring items’’ of the Income statement in accordance with the terms of the lease.

**1.13. Investment properties**

Investment properties consist of land or buildings, held to earn rentals or capital appreciation.

Investment properties purchased by Lecta Group’s companies are stated at historical cost,
increased where appropriate by terminal environmental reinstatement costs (none in Lecta Group).

When acquired by Lecta Group through a business combination, they are stated at their fair value
at the date of acquisition.

At closing date, investment properties are stated at the above-mentioned gross value less
accumulated depreciation and any impairment.

Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the following estimated useful lives:

Land . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . No depreciation
Buildings . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 30 to 40 years

Investment properties in Lecta Group consisted of plots of land in Amorebieta/Carmen mill closed
in 2009, and in Sarri`a del Ter mill closed in 2014 (see Note 16.2).

**1.14. Business combinations and goodwill**

_Business combinations from 1 January 2009 (prospective application)_

Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition
is measured as the aggregate of the consideration transferred, measured at acquisition date fair value
and the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree. For each business combination, the
acquirer measures the non-controlling interest in the acquiree either at fair value or at the
proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. Acquisition costs incurred are expensed in
the line ‘‘Non-recurring items’’ (see Notes 1.06 and 11).

When the Group acquires a business, it assesses the financial assets and liabilities assumed for
appropriate classification and designation in accordance with the contractual terms, economic
circumstances and pertinent conditions as at the acquisition date.

F-41


-----

**NOTES — (Continued)**

If the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date fair value of the acquirer’s
previously held equity interest in the acquiree is remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date
through profit or loss. Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer is recognized at
fair value at the acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration
which is deemed to be an asset or liability, are recognized in accordance with IAS 39 either in profit or
loss or as a change to other comprehensive income. If the contingent consideration is classified as
equity, it is not remeasured until it is finally settled within equity.

Goodwill is initially measured at cost being the excess of the aggregate of the consideration
transferred and the amount recognized for non-controlling interest over the net identifiable assets
acquired and liabilities assumed. If this consideration is lower than the fair value of the net assets of
the subsidiary acquired, the difference (formerly known as negative goodwill) is recognized in profit or
loss in the line ‘‘Non-recurring items’’ of the Income statement. After initial recognition, goodwill is
measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.

_Business combinations prior to 1 January 2009_

In comparison to the above-mentioned requirements, the following differences applied:

Business combinations were accounted for using the purchase method. Transaction costs directly
attributable to the acquisition formed part of the acquisition costs. The non-controlling interest (or
non-controlling interest) was measured at the proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net
assets. Business combinations achieved in stages were accounted for as separate steps. Any additional
acquired share of interest did not affect previously recognized goodwill. Contingent consideration was
recognized if, and only if, the Group had a present obligation, the economic outflow was more likely
than not and a reliable estimate was determinable. Subsequent adjustments to the contingent
consideration were recognized as part of goodwill.

**1.15. Other intangible assets**

Other intangible assets acquired separately are recognized at cost. Intangible assets acquired as
part of a business combination are recognized separately from Goodwill if the fair value can be
measured reliably on initial recognition, subject to the constraint that, unless the asset has a readily
ascertainable market value. The carrying values of intangible assets with definite useful lives are tested
for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be
recoverable. The carrying values of intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for
impairment on a yearly basis.

Research and Development costs are expensed when incurred, except for certain development
costs that are recognized when it is probable that the project will generate future economic benefits,
and the costs can be measured reliably.

Other internally generated intangible assets are not capitalized, but expensed against profit in the
year the costs were incurred.

Other intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis, over the shortest period between
their own legal duration and the useful life of the assets to which they benefit.

**NOTES — (Continued)**

**1.16. CO2 emission rights**

In order to comply with the Kyoto protocol, the European Union has set up the CO2 (or
Greenhouse Gas) emission rights scheme.

Lecta Group elected to use the implicit rule of IAS 20 ‘‘Accounting for government grants and
disclosure of government assistance’’ to account for the CO2 emission rights. This rule is sometimes
referred to as ‘‘net liability method’’:

According to the ‘‘net liability method’’, the rights that have been granted free of charge by each
National Authority are not recognized. A provision at fair value is recognized for the tons of CO2
emitted in excess of the rights granted by each National Authority.

Purchased rights are initially recognized at cost in the line ‘‘Other intangible assets’’ of the
Statement of financial position.

After initial recognition, the purchased rights that are not in excess of the above-mentioned
provisioned tons are measured at fair value.

The rights in excess are kept at their historical cost, unless the market price drops below this cost.
In such a case, these rights are impaired.

All the movements in the Income statement are reported in the line ‘‘Other operating costs except
non-recurring items’’.

These rules are implemented separately for each Subsidiary, because National Authorities grant
the rights to single companies.

**1.17. Green & White certificates**

On top of selling steam and electricity to Garda mill, excess electricity to the national grid, Alto
Garda Power SrL sells hot water to the local urban heating network. This gives Alto Garda Power SrL
title to the grant of Green certificates for a period of eight years starting in January 2010. No
obligation is attached to these Green certificates.

Lecta Group elected to use the implicit rule of IAS 20 ‘‘Accounting for government grants and
disclosure of government assistance’’ to account for the Green certificates. They are recognized as an
intangible asset, initially at nominal value, until they are sold to a third party. Following a change in
Italian regulation dated 6 July 2012, the Green certificates are recognized as a non-monetary
government grant, which corresponds to GSE (Gestore dei Servizi Energetici) guaranteed price. An
additional profit can be recognized in the line ‘‘Other operating costs except non-recurring items’’ of
the Income statement upon the sale of Green certificate if the actual sales price is higher than the
guaranteed one.

Thanks to its savings in the consumption of natural gas, Alto Garda Power SrL is entitled to a
grant of White certificates for a period of ten years starting in January 2012. No obligation is attached
to these White certificates.

Lecta Group elected to use the implicit rule of IAS 20 ‘‘Accounting for government grants and
disclosure of government assistance’’ to account for the White certificates. They are recognized as a
non-monetary government grant, which corresponds to GSE (Gestore dei Servizi Energetici)
guaranteed price. An additional profit can be recognized in the line ‘‘Other operating costs except
non-recurring items’’ of the Income statement upon the sale of Green certificate if the actual sales
price is higher than the guaranteed one.

**1.18. Financial assets**

Financial assets are accounted for by considering the four categories defined by IAS 39, Financial
instruments recognition and measurement:

– Available-for-sale financial assets,

– Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss,

– Held-to-maturity investments,

– Loans and receivables,

F-43


-----

**NOTES — (Continued)**

Initially, all financial assets are recognized at their fair value, plus in the case of a Financial asset
not at fair value through profit or loss transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition or issue
of the said financial asset.

Then the accounting rules differ from one category to another:

_Available-for-sale financial assets are acquired to be held for an indefinite period of time but may_
be sold due to changed strategic decisions.

After initial recognition, they are measured at fair value.

Gains or losses are directly recognized in the line ‘‘Net incomes (expenses) recognized directly
through Equity’’ of the Statement of financial position, until the investment is sold, collected or
otherwise disposed of, or until the investment is determined to be impaired, at which time the
cumulative gain or loss previously reported in Equity is included in the line ‘‘Non-recurring items’’ of
the Income statement.

Call and put options on shares of non-consolidated companies (derivatives held for trading) are
accounted for at fair value in the lines ‘‘Other receivables’’ or ‘‘Other payables’’ of the Statement of
financial position. Changes in the fair value are entered in the line ‘‘Non-recurring items’’ of the
Income statement.

In Lecta Group, Available-for-sale investments are shares in companies that are not consolidated
on the basis of immateriality or because of the low ownership. They are reported in the line
‘‘Available-for-sale financial investments’’, in Non-current assets of the Statement of financial position.

_Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss include financial assets held for trading and_
financial assets designated upon initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss. Financial assets
are classified as held for trading if they are acquired for the purpose of selling or repurchasing in the
near term.

After initial recognition, they are measured at fair value.

Gains or losses are recognized in the lines ‘‘Financial income’’ and ‘‘Financial expense’’ of the
Income statement.

In Lecta Group, Investments at fair value through the profit or loss are money market funds used
to safely invest temporary excess cash. They are included in the line ‘‘Cash and cash equivalents’’, in
the Current assets of the Statement of financial position.

_Held-to-maturity investments are acquired with the intent to hold them to their fixed maturity_
(e.g. bonds).

Held-to-maturity investments are included in the line ‘‘Other non-current receivables’’, in the
Non-current assets of the Statement of financial position.

After initial recognition, they are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate
method. Amortized cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition,
over the period to maturity.

Gains and losses are recognized in the line ‘‘Finance costs’’ of the Income statement when the
investments are derecognized or impaired, as well as through the amortization process.

Lecta Group does not hold such investments.

_Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that_
are not quoted in an active market.

After initial recognition, they are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate
method. Amortized cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition,
over the period to maturity.

Gains and losses are recognized in the line ‘‘Non-recurring items’’ of the Income statement when
the investments are derecognized or impaired, as well as through the amortization process.

F-44


-----

**NOTES — (Continued)**

This category comprises for Lecta Group:

– the Trade receivables (see Note 1.23);

– the financial investments originated by the group included in the line ‘‘Other non-current
assets’’ in the Non-current assets of the Statement of financial position (see Notes 1.25 and
1.34):

– deposits,

– guarantees,

– loans to non-consolidated companies or third parties.

_Date of recognition_

All sales and purchases of financial assets are recognized using the settlement date, i.e. the date
the asset is delivered to or received from the counterpart.

Included in this category are all sales or purchases of financial assets that require delivery of assets
within the timeframe generally established by regulation or convention in the market place.

_Derecognition_

See Note 1.37.

**1.19. Biological assets**

In Lecta Group, biological assets are limited to standing timber. The latter is exclusively dedicated
to internal consumption for the production of pulp.

They are reported in the line ‘‘Biological assets’’, under Non-current assets of the Statement of
financial position. They are measured at fair value.

**1.20. Non-current assets held for sale**

A non-current asset is held for sale if its carrying amount will be recovered principally through a
sale transaction rather than through continuing use. For this to be the case, the asset must be available
for immediate sale in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sales
of such assets and its sale must be highly probable.

The non-current assets classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying
amount and their fair value less costs to sell. They are not depreciated any more. They are presented
separately from the other assets in the Statement of financial position.

**1.21. Impairment of certain long-lived assets**

Property, plant and equipment, Investment properties and Other intangible assets are reviewed for
impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be
recoverable. This review is done each year for the Goodwill and other indefinite life intangible assets.
Where the carrying values exceed the estimated recoverable amount, the asset or the associated
cash-generating unit is written down to its recoverable amount.

The recoverable amount is the greater of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing
value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax
discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific
to the asset. For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable
amount is determined for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.

Impairment losses are recognized in the line ‘‘Non-recurring items’’ in the Income statement.

**1.22. Inventories**

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost includes materials, direct
labor and an attributable proportion of manufacturing overheads based on normal levels of activity.

F-45


-----

**NOTES — (Continued)**

Cost is computed according to the weighted average cost method. Net realizable value is based on
estimated selling price, less further costs expected to be incurred to completion and disposal.

Given the lack of meaningful market references, the inventoried spare parts are impaired in
accordance with slow moving rules reflecting their obsolescence.

**1.23. Trade receivables**

Trade receivables are recognized and carried at original invoice amount less an allowance for
uncollectable amounts.

An estimate for doubtful debts is made when collection of part or all of a receivable is no longer
probable. Bad debts are written off when identified.

**1.24. Prepayments**

This heading comprises payments to trade or other payables for future benefits such as insurance
premiums, maintenance expenses and rents. Prepayments are stated at their nominal value.

**1.25. Other receivables**

This heading comprises:

– Loans,

– Deposits and guarantees,

– Grants receivables,

– Capital receivables on the sale of long-lived assets,

– Shareholders receivables (e.g. on capital increase),

– Dividends receivables,

– Favorable options on non-consolidated companies,

– Favorable currency hedging,

– Favorable interest rate hedging,

– Favorable energy price hedging,

– Miscellaneous other receivables (e.g. expected reimbursement through an insurance contract).

**1.26. Cash and cash equivalents**

This heading comprises:

– Cash in hand,

– Cash in banks’ current accounts,

– Short-term deposits and certificates of deposit with an original maturity of three months or
less,

– Marketable securities (Government bonds, Treasury bills and similar short-term securities).

Any gains and losses on Cash and cash equivalents are recognized in the Income statement, under
the lines ‘‘Financial income’’ and ‘‘Financial expense’’.

Note: In the Cash flow statement, the analysis is focused on variation of Cash and cash equivalents
_net of Bank overdrafts._

**1.27. Interest-bearing borrowings and Bank overdrafts**

Initially, all financial liabilities are recognized at their fair value, plus in the case of a Financial
liability not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the
acquisition or issue of the financial liability.

F-46


-----

**NOTES — (Continued)**

After initial recognition, they are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate
method. Amortized cost is calculated by taking into account any issue costs and any discount or
premium on settlement.

Gains and losses are recognized in the lines ‘‘Financial income’’ and ‘‘Financial expense’’ of the
Income statement, when the liabilities are derecognized or impaired, as well as through the
amortization process.

Lecta Group applies IAS 23 (revised) — Borrowing Costs as of 1 January 2009. Since the related
criteria were not met in 2009 and 2010, Lecta Group did not recognize any borrowing cost in the
long-lived assets until 31 December 2010. In 2011, some borrowing cost in the long-lived assets were
capitalized (see Note 12).

_Financial liabilities at fair value through the profit or loss include financial liabilities held for trading_
and financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition as at fair value through profit or loss.

Financial liabilities are classified as held for trading if they are acquired for the purpose of selling
in the near term. Derivatives, including separated embedded derivatives are also classified as held for
trading unless they are designated as effective hedging instruments.

After initial recognition, they are measured at fair value.

Gains or losses are recognized in the lines ‘‘Financial income’’ and ‘‘Financial expense’’ of the
Income statement.

In Lecta Group, no financial liabilities were designated as at fair value through profit or loss.

**1.28. Grants**

Grants constitute deferred income related to Property, plant and equipment, or Borrowings with
off-market interest rates. Grants are recognized at their fair value. They are released on a straight-line
basis in the line ‘‘Depreciation’’ of the Income statement, over the expected useful life of the relevant
asset.

**1.29. Provisions**

Provisions are recognized when:

– Lecta Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event; and

– It is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to
settle the obligation; and

– A reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made.

Where Lecta Group expects the impact of a provision to be neutralized, for example under an
insurance contract, a separate asset is recognized when it is virtually certain.

If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the
expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value
of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.

Where discounting is used, the change of the provision due to the time value of money is
recognized in the lines ‘‘Financial income’’ or ‘‘Financial expense’’ in the Income statement.

**1.30. Employee benefits**

Lecta Group’s employees take advantage of various benefits schemes:

– Short-term employee benefits:

These include wages, salaries, paid holidays, social contributions, sick leave, compensated
absences, bonuses, profit sharing and non-monetary benefits, all paid within 12 months after
service is rendered.

F-47


-----

**NOTES — (Continued)**

– Defined contribution post-employment plans:

The cost to the employer is fixed and predictable.

The charge for the period is the contribution due in respect of the service rendered during the
period. Payments in advance are reported in the line ‘‘Prepayments’’ of the Statement of
financial position. Payments in arrears are reported in the line ‘‘Trade payables’’ of the
Statement of financial position. Any accrual that does not fall due within 12 months beyond
Statement of financial position date is discounted and recognized at its present value.

– Defined benefit post-employment plans:

The employer retains a risk of additional contributions to be paid.

The plan is valued in the Statement of financial position at the present value of the obligation
less the fair value of any plan assets legally separate from the employer.

Any unrecognized past service costs, is immediately recognized.

All actuarial gains or losses are immediately recognized.

For any curtailment or settlement, the resulting change is immediately recognized.

– Other long-term benefits:

These include long-service or jubilee benefits.

All actuarial gains or losses and any past service costs are immediately recognized.

– Termination benefits:

These include early retirement schemes or redundancy programs.

They are recognized as a liability and an expense when and only when a company of Lecta
Group is demonstrably committed to terminate the employment of a group of employees
before the normal retirement date or provide termination benefits as a result of an offer made
to encourage voluntary redundancy.

Lecta Group employees do not benefit from Equity compensation benefits plan or share based
payments plan.

The employee benefits may be funded, resulting in a debt obligation with financial institutions, or
unfunded, resulting in the booking of a provision. Independent qualified actuaries review any material
long-term obligation of Lecta Group.

The costs are accounted for as follows:

– The actuarial gains and losses of Defined benefit post-employment plans are directly
recognized in the lines ‘‘Net incomes (expenses) recognized directly through Equity’’ and
‘‘Deferred tax’’ of the Statement of financial position.

– All the other costs are recognized in the Income statement, in the following lines:

– Costs related to active employees: ‘‘Labor costs’’.

– Costs related to retired people: ‘‘Other operating costs except non-recurring items’’.

– Costs due to the time value of money: ‘‘Financial expense’’.

**1.31. Income tax payable**

Income tax payable includes withholding tax.

**1.32. Deferred tax**

Deferred tax is provided, using the liability method, on all temporary differences at the Statement
of financial position date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for
financial reporting purposes.

F-48


-----

**NOTES — (Continued)**

Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for all taxable temporary differences (e.g. accelerated tax
depreciation, deductible legal revaluation), except (i) where the deferred tax liability arises from the
initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business
combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit
or loss, or (ii) in respect of taxable temporary differences that will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Deferred tax assets are recognized for all deductible temporary differences (e.g. employee benefits
paid to financial institutions for which the deductibility is deferred), carry forward of unused tax credits
and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available to use these
assets. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to
the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part
of the deferred tax asset to be utilized. Unrecognized deferred tax assets are reassessed at each
reporting date and are recognized to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profits
will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the
period when the asset is realized or the liability settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have
been enacted or substantively enacted at the Statement of financial position date.

Deferred tax relating to items recognized outside the Income statement is also recognized outside
the Income statement, i.e. in the Statement of comprehensive income or directly in Equity in the
Statement of financial position.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset, if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current
tax assets against current income tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity
and the same taxation authority.

**1.33. Trade payables**

This heading comprises:

– Trade payables,

– Employees and social charges,

– VAT and other taxes except Income tax and withholding tax,

– Any accruals on the above.

**1.34. Other payables**

This heading comprises:

– Capital payables following the purchase of long-lived assets,

– Shareholders payables (e.g. on capital redemption),

– Dividends payables,

– Options on Minorities of consolidated companies (see Note 1.35),

– Unfavorable options on non-consolidated companies,

– Unfavorable currency hedging,

– Unfavorable interest rate hedging,

– Unfavorable energy price hedging,

– Miscellaneous other payables (non-recurring items).

**1.35. Options on Minorities of consolidated companies**

Options on Minorities of consolidated companies currently held by Lecta are Equity derivatives.

A premium paid or received on equity derivatives at inception is recorded in Equity in a specific
line ‘‘Equity derivatives’’. Up to now, Lecta Group did not pay such premiums.

F-49


-----

**NOTES — (Continued)**

The discounted value of the exercise price of a sold option or a firm commitment, at inception and
at each year-end, is recorded in the line ‘‘Other payables’’ against the line ‘‘Non-controlling interests’’.

Since 1 January 2009 and in accordance with IAS27 (revised), when a sold option or a firm
commitment on minorities is exercised, the amount in Other payables is reversed against Cash, and the
remaining balances of non-controlling interests and Equity derivatives are reversed against Equity.

**1.36. Derivative hedging instruments**

Lecta Group uses derivative instruments to hedge foreign currency, interest rate and energy price
fluctuations. Such derivative instruments are stated at their fair values as communicated by the financial
institutions and the energy companies that are the counterparties to these transactions.

For accounting purposes, derivative instruments are classified in the three following categories:

– _Fair value hedges: to cover the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or_
liability.

In Lecta Group, these are forward agreements on realized day-to-day sales and purchases in
non-euro currencies. Any gain or loss from re-measuring the hedging instrument at fair value
is recognized in the line ‘‘Other operating costs except non-recurring items’’ of the Income
statement against ‘‘Trade receivables’’ or ‘‘Trade payables’’.

– _Cash flow hedges: to cover the exposure to variability in cash flows that is attributable to a_
particular risk associated with a forecast transaction.

In Lecta Group, these could be the interest rate, exchange rate and energy price swaps, caps,
floors, collars, options. The portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is
determined to be an effective hedge is recognized directly in the line ‘‘Net incomes (expenses)
recognized directly through Equity’’ of the Statement of financial position against ‘‘Other
receivables’’ or ‘‘Other payables’’. It is removed from Equity when the hedged item affects the
Income statement. The ineffective portion of gain or loss is immediately recognized in the line
‘‘Non-recurring items’’ of the Income statement.

– _Hedges of net investments in foreign entities denominated in a non-euro currency:_

In Lecta Group, there is no such instrument.

The accounting treatment is the same as for Cash flow hedges.

**1.37. Derecognition of financial assets and liabilities**

_Financial assets_

A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of group of similar
financial assets) is derecognized when:

a) The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired; or

b) The Group retains the right to receive cash flows from the asset, but has assumed an obligation to
pay them in full without material delay to a third party under a pass through arrangement; or

c) The Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset and either (i) has
transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or (ii) has neither transferred nor
retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.

Where the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from an asset and has neither
transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset nor transferred control of
the asset, the asset is recognized to the extent of the Group’s continuing involvement in the asset.
Continuing involvement that takes the form of a guarantee over the transferred asset is measured at
the lower of the original carrying amount of the asset and the maximum amount of consideration that
the Group could be required to repay.

F-50


-----

**NOTES — (Continued)**

Where continuing involvement takes the form of a written and / or purchased option (including a
cash settled option or similar provision) on the transferred asset, the extent of the Group’s continuing
involvement is the amount of the transferred asset that the Group may repurchase, except that in the
case of a written put option (including a cash settled option or similar provision) on an asset measured
at fair value, the extent of the Group’s continuing involvement is limited to the lower of the fair value
of the transferred asset and the option exercise price.

_Financial liabilities_

A financial liability is derecognized when the obligation under the liability is discharged or
cancelled or expired.

**1.38. Future changes in accounting policies**

New amended IAS or interpretations effective as of 1 January 2016:

– In December 2013, the IASB issued Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2012-2014 Cycle, a
collection of amendments to IFRSs, in response to eight issues addressed during the
2012-2014 cycle. The proposed amendments reflect issues discussed by the IASB in the project
cycle that began in 2012. These amendments meet the criteria for the annual improvements
process set out in the IASB Due Process Handbook. The criteria help in deciding whether a
matter relating to the clarification or correction of IFRSs should be addressed using the
annual improvements process. The proposed effective date for the amendments is for annual
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016, although the IASB proposes that entities would
be permitted to apply them earlier.

New amended IAS or interpretations effective as of 1 January 2017:

– In January 2016, the IASB issued amendments to IAS 12 Income Taxes. The amendments,
Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealized Losses (Amendments to IAS 12), clarify
how to account for deferred tax assets related to debt instruments measured at fair value.
IAS 12 provides requirements on the recognition and measurement of current or deferred tax
liabilities or assets. The issued amendments clarify the requirements on recognition of
deferred tax assets for unrealized losses to address diversity in practice. Entities are required
to apply the amendments for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017. Earlier
application is permitted.

New amended IAS or interpretations effective as of 1 January 2018:

– In July 2014, the IASB completed the final element of its comprehensive response to the
financial crisis by issuing IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (replacement of IAS 39). The package
of improvements introduced by IFRS 9 includes a logical model for classification and
measurement, a single, forward-looking ‘expected loss’ impairment model and a substantiallyreformed approach to hedge accounting. The new Standard will come into effect on 1 January
2018 with early application permitted.

Lecta Group is evaluating the effects of the above standards applicable as from 1 January 2016,
1 January 2017 and 1 January 2018 and expects that their adoption will have no material impact on the
financial statements.

Additionally, Lecta Group started the analysis of IFRS 15 ‘‘Revenue from Contracts with
Customers’’ and IFRS 16 ‘‘Leases’’ effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018
and 1 January 2019, respectively.

– IFRS 15 ‘‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’’ was issued in May 2014 and establishes a
five-step model to account for revenue arising from contracts with customers. Under IFRS 15,
revenue is recognized at an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects
to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer. The new revenue
standard will supersede all current revenue recognition requirements under IFRS. The new
standard is applicable for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. Lecta Group is
in the process of analyzing the impact of this standard on the group.

F-51


-----

**NOTES — (Continued)**

– IFRS 16 ‘‘Leases’’ was issued in January 2016. It replaces IAS 17 ‘‘Leases’’. The major change
introduced by the new Standard is that leases will be brought onto companies’ balance sheets,
increasing the visibility of their assets and liabilities. IFRS 16 removes the classification of
leases as either operating leases or finance leases (for the lessee — the lease customer),
treating all leases as finance leases. The new standard is applicable for annual periods
beginning on or after 1 January 2019. Lecta Group is in the process of analyzing the impact of
this standard on the group.

working time and the structure of the remuneration. Condat’s management successfully
negotiated with the unions a new set of labor side agreements designed to promote the
company performance, and the individual and collective efforts. Additional negotiations in
the same area are still in progress.

– Closure of a warehouse in UK with a job reduction position of 4 (September 2013).

– Reorganization of the Paper merchanting structure in Italy and France aiming at centralizing
the management and administration activities, adapting the structure to the reduced size of
the market, outsourcing the transportation activity, reorganizing the logistic services with the
closure of 3 warehouses in December 2013 and 1 in August 2014, associated to a job position
reduction of 78 (until August 2014);

– Permanent closure of Berrobi / Uranga paper mill (with a production capacity of 27,000 tons
of base paper) (January 2014);

– Sarri`a de Ter paper mill (with a production capacity of 65,000 tons of base paper and UWF)

**3.5. Royal decree and Ministerial order applicable to Spanish cogeneration plants**

**3.5.1. Reversal of impairment of some Cogeneraci´on Motril’s assets**

As the Royal decree n�413/2014 and the Ministerial order n�IET/1045/2014 affected the future cash
flows of Cogeneraci´on Motril SA, Lecta decided to impair its tangible assets and its stock of spare
parts, and booked an impairment charge of EUR (4.5) M in December 2013.

As the cogeneration mill continue running for the benefit of the Motril’s paper mill, the
impairment charge of EUR 4.5 M was reversed in 2014 (see Note 11).

**3.5.2. Reversal of impairment of some Cogeneraci´on del Ter’s assets and participative loan.**

In 2015, a gas turbine of Cogeneraci´on del Ter SL, en liquidaci´on, was sold to Torraspapel SA
(Zaragoza’s mill) for EUR 0.8 M. Consequently, the 2014 impairment of this asset was reversed (See
Note 11).

The disposal of the gas turbine in 2015 together with tax advantages will enable Cogeneraci´on del
Ter SL, en liquidaci´on, to repay the participative loan of EUR 1.8 M to Torraspapel SA. Consequently,
the 2014 impairment of this loan was reversed.

**3.6. Non-recognition of some deferred tax assets**

The uncertainties in short-term future profitability, led to the non-recognition of some deferred tax
assets (see Notes 13 and 32.3). In 2015, the impact was EUR (6.9) M.

**3.7. Net loss on one important Lecta’s customers**

One of important Lecta’s customers placed three of its subsidiaries in administration in April 2015.
Taking into account the protective measures taken by Lecta’s management, the above EBITDA impact
was estimated at EUR (6.5) M.

**NOTES — (Continued)**

**3.8. Sale of non-industrial properties**

In May 2015, Lecta sold the land of the mill in Berrobi/Uranga permanently closed in January
2014 (see Note 3.4) against a cash payment of EUR 0.5 M, leading to the recognition of a pre-tax
capital loss of EUR (0.1) M (see Note 11).

In July 2015, Lecta sold some plots of land and unused machinery of Sarri`a de Ter mill
permanently closed in October 2014 (see Note 3.4) against the payment of EUR 11.0 M, leading to the
recognition of a pre-tax capital gain of EUR 7.4 M (see Note 11).

**3.9. Substitution of an old gas turbine in Alta Garda Power SrL**

The substitution of the old gas turbine in Alta Garda Power SrL with a new one entailed a loss of
EUR (1,931) K.

Nevertheless, this decision was taken because the new gas turbine has more functions and more
capabilities. In addition, the supplier will offer the maintenance of the Hot Section free of charge, and
Alta Garda Power SrL is also expected to receive a tax credit (see Note 11).

**4.** **Significant events of 2014**

The present chapter is an extract of the items disclosed in the Annual report of 2014.

**4.1. Cap on interest rates**

hedged with a Cap indexed to 3-month Euribor for the period from mid-November 2014 to mid-August
2016. This Cap complemented the Swap and other Caps already in place (see Note 38.5).

**5.** **Information by Operating Segment**

The EBITDA increased by EUR 9,334 K (or 9.3%) in 2015. This variance results from:

– Decrease of EUR (5,610) K in CWF mainly because of lower volume produced and shipped,
and the bankruptcy of one important Lecta’s customer (see Note 3.7).

– Increase of EUR 10,989 K in Specialties mainly thanks to higher volume produced and
shipped, and higher net sales prices.

– Increase of EUR 3,955 K in Purchased Products, mainly thanks to higher spread and lower
selling variable cost, partly offset by lower volume shipped,.

‘‘Basic earnings per share’’ were computed on the basis of the weighted average number of shares
issued after deduction of the weighted average number of shares owned by Lecta Group consolidated
companies (none for these two years).

‘‘Diluted earnings per share’’ took into account share equivalents having a dilutive effect after
deduction of the weighted average number of share equivalents owned by Lecta Group consolidated
companies. The dilutive effect of warrants was calculated using the notional investment method for
which the Net earnings were adjusted to include a notional after tax interest income on proceeds
coming from the sale of warrants.

Nota: IAS

33 paragraph 43 requires that the diluted earnings per share does not assume conversion, exercise
or other issue of potential ordinary shares that would have an anti-dilutive effect on earnings per share.

**15. Dividends paid and proposed**

**Impairment test of Goodwill:**

In consideration of the integrated organization of Lecta focused on production and sale of paper
only, the volume of intragroup transactions, the interchangeability of products between mills, Lecta
considers one cash-generating unit. Consequently, goodwill was tested for impairment at Group level
only.

This is consistent with the Note 5 prepared in accordance with IFRS 8 ‘‘Operating Segments’’.

The recoverable amount of this cash-generating unit has been determined based on value-in-use
calculation (see Note 1.21). This was produced based upon 2016 to 2019 cash-flow projections part of
Lecta financial plan, as approved by Lecta Group Management.

As mentioned in Note 1.01, Lecta Group Management made assumptions for the years to come.
Conservative assumptions on the annual growth rate were applied to the cash flow projections beyond
2019. The WACC rate applied to cash flow projections was 9.4% (against 9.7% in 2014).

On 31 December 2015, the impairment test was successfully passed and no impairment was
recognized.

-----

**NOTES — (Continued)**

A sensitivity analysis showed that:

– An increase of 100 bps of the WACC rate applied to cash flow projections, from 9.4% to
10.4%, everything else being equal, has an unfavorable impact of EUR 83 M. This WACC
increase would not result in impairment of the Goodwill.

– A reduction of 10% in EBITDA applied to the period 2016 to 2019 and beyond 2019,
everything else being equal, has an unfavorable impact of EUR 69 M. This EBITDA
reduction would not result in impairment of the Goodwill.

_Retirement plan IFC (‘‘Indemnit´es de Fin de Carri`ere’’):_ It is a one-time payment made by the
company when (and only when) the employee leaves the company for retirement. The
obligation is regulated by the ‘‘Convention Collective Distribution et Commerce de Gros
Papier et Carton’’ n�802 (‘‘OETAM’’) and 925 (‘‘cadres’’), and by the ‘‘Accord National
Interprofessionnel des VRP’’ n�804. In case of voluntary retirement, the benefit goes from 0.2

company makes employees take compulsory retirement, the benefit is increased by 20% to
30%, or from 0.05 to 0.35 months per year of seniority for the sales representatives (‘‘VRP’’).

introduced in 2007, the TFR is no longer a defined benefit plan but has become a defined
contribution plan. Nevertheless, the TFR contribution amounts accrued until 31 December
2006 continues to be managed by the Company and thus the related liability continues to be
recorded in the financial statements as a long-term liability that has to be accounted for at its
present value (subject to actuarial evaluation). The present value of the employee termination
indemnity liability has been computed by an independent actuary considering the abovementioned change in law. The effect as at 1 January 2007, deriving from the change in law,

All the transactions with related parties were made on an arm’s length basis.

**37.2. Key management personnel compensation**

During the year ended 31 December 2015, the members of the Board of Directors, including
executive officers, received remuneration. This remuneration was charged at an aggregate cost of
EUR 1.8 M.

**37.3. Other related parties**

This is an option on the minority of a consolidated company.

**38.1.1. Sold put and Purchased call option on the shares of IDAE Sant Joan AIE**

IDAE Sant Joan AIE owns the cogeneration plant located in Sant Joan. Torraspapel SA (51%)
and IDAE (49%) currently hold IDAE Sant Joan AIE. According to the partnership agreement signed
in December 2007 between Torraspapel SA and IDAE (Spanish Public Entity), IDAE shall remain as a
partner in IDAE Sant Joan AIE until it recovers its investment plus a remuneration of 3-month
Euribor + 4%.

Once the first five years as of start-off of the cogeneration plant (August 2011) have elapsed,
Torraspapel SA may also request the assignment of IDAE’s share participation in IDAE Sant Joan
AIE. For that purpose, Torraspapel SA would have to pay IDAE an amount equal to its investment
plus the referred remuneration once deducted any amounts already reimbursed to IDAE by any means.

In both cases, assignment is only possible if:

– All loans granted to IDAE Sant Joan AIE by any third parties have been previously repaid.

– Or the relevant creditors specifically waive all claims against IDAE.

**NOTES — (Continued)**

There was no premium paid at inception. The fair value of the purchased call option cannot be
reliably measured.

**38.2. Derivatives held for trading**

These are options on the shares or the assets of non-consolidated companies.

**38.2.1. Purchased call option agreement on the shares of SVL Pilote S`arl**

The current shareholder of SVL Pilote S`arl is:

— Private owner: . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 100%

If the option was exercised, Condat SAS would acquire up to 100% of the shares.

At 31 December 2015, the minimum exercise price of the option was EUR 1.5 M.

This price was considered as higher or equal to the fair value of the company. Therefore, nothing
was disclosed in the Statement of financial position.

**38.2.2. Purchased call option agreement on the tangible assets of P´erigord Energies SNC[´]**

The current shareholders of P´erigord Energies SNC are:[´]

– GDF SUEZ Energie Services SA: 99.8%

– SETHELEC SNC: 0.2%

There was a contract between P´erigord Energies SNC and Condat SAS for the supply of steam[´]
(see Note 35.4.1). Three months before the end of this 12-year contract, i.e. on 31 December 2012,
Condat SAS had to take the option to purchase 100% of the tangible assets of P´erigord Energies SNC[´]
or not. By means of a letter dated 21 December 2012, Condat SAS undertook to sign a new contract
for the supply of steam for an additional period up to 31 December 2016 but decided not to purchase
the tangible assets. The new contract was signed on 17 January 2014. It grants Condat SAS an option
to purchase 100% of the tangible assets for a total price of EUR 5 M as at 31 December 2016, or for
their Net Booked Value in case of early termination.

**38.3. Assignment of trade receivables**

From time to time, Lecta Group assigns trade receivables to financial institutions through
non-recourse agreements.

Such operations are accounted for in conformity with the accounting policy described in Note 1.37.

– Factoring: The corresponding advance is accounted for in the borrowings and disclosed in
Note 28.4. There was none as at 31 December 2015.

– Non-recourse invoice discounting and factoring: The residual commitment computed using the
continuous involvement methodology is accounted for in the borrowings and disclosed in
Note 28.4. The face value of these discounted invoices was EUR 40.5 M as at 31 December
2015.

– Non-recourse assignment: In such case, there is no residual commitment.

**38.4. Derivatives on foreign currencies**

The Lecta Group operations are impacted by the fluctuations of the non-euro currencies, mainly
USD and GBP.

At 31 December 2015, ordinary sales and purchases were specifically hedged through:

— Forward agreements on realized sales in foreign currencies: . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . EUR 37.4 M
— Forward agreements on realized purchases in foreign currencies: . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . EUR 11.8 M

F-107


-----

**NOTES — (Continued)**

The impact of these contracts has been accounted for as fair value hedging, hence recognized in
the Income statement (see Note 1.36).

At 31 December 2015, there were no options on future sales in foreign currencies and on future
purchases in foreign currencies. Therefore, nothing had to be fair valued through Income statement.

Furthermore, in June 2007, Alto Garda Power SrL entered into a 13-year agreement with Italia
General Electric SpA, in order to execute the planned maintenance of the new cogeneration plant for
the period 2008 to 2020. As the payments of this agreement had to be made in USD, on 20 September
2007, Alto Garda Power SrL entered into several currency forward contracts for the purpose of hedging
part of its maintenance costs against any unexpected fluctuation of exchange rate of USD until
20 December 2014. The impact of these contracts has been accounted for as cash flow hedge. The
intrinsic value, considered as effective, was recognized directly in Equity while the time value was
considered as ineffective, and thus recognized in the Income statement (see Note 1.36).

**38.5. Hedging derivatives on interest rates**

_2012 Floating Rate Notes:_

[1] On 3 May 2013, the interest rate of 26% of the Floating rate notes was hedged with a Swap to
exchange 3-month Euribor variable rate against fixed rate of 0.385% for the period from mid-August
2013 to mid-February 2016.

[2] On 24 April 2014, the interest rate of 26% of the Floating rate notes was hedged with a Cap
indexed to 3-month Euribor for the period from mid-August 2014 to mid-August 2016.

[3] On 3 October 2014, the interest rate of 26% of the Floating rate notes was hedged with a Cap
indexed to 3-month Euribor for the period from mid-November 2014 to mid-August 2016.

_Alto Garda Power SrL:_

[4] On 5 September 2007, the interest rate of 50% of the forecast debt in Alto Garda Power SrL
was hedged with a Collar indexed to 6-month Euribor for the period from June 2007 to December
2018.

On 16 March 2010, the interest rate of 25% of the forecast debt was hedged with a Swap to
exchange 6-month Euribor variable rate against fixed rate of 2.995% for the period June 2010 to
December 2018.

In December 2012, Alto Garda Power SrL voluntarily repaid EUR 12 M of its debt. Following this
repayment, the notional amounts of the Collar and the Swap were higher than the debt. Consequently,
the Collar and part of the Swap was considered as hedging instruments, while the balance of the Swap
was no more considered as hedging instrument.

On 18 December 2013, the Swap to exchange 6-month Euribor variable rate was terminated.

_IDAE Sant Joan AIE:_

[5] On 23 July 2010, the interest rate of 75% of the forecast debt in IDAE Sant Joan AIE was
hedged with a Swap to exchange 1-month Euribor variable rate against fixed rate of 2.14% for the
period from June 2011 to March 2016.

[6] On 23 December 2015, the interest rate of 70% of the forecast debt in IDAE Sant Joan AIE
(See Note 28.4) was hedged with a Cap indexed to 3-month Euribor for the period from June 2016 to
September 2018. This Cap took effect 3 months after the termination of the prior interest rates hedge
of the forecast debt in IDAE Sant Joan AIE (See [5]).

The impact of these agreements has been accounted for as cash flow hedge, except for the balance
of the Swap in Alto Garda Power SrL that was accounted for as fair value hedge as at 31 December
2012.

For the cash flow hedge, the intrinsic value, considered as effective, was recognized directly in
Equity while the time value was considered as ineffective, and thus recognized in the Income statement.
For the fair value hedge, any gain or loss from re-measuring the hedging instrument at fair value is
recognized in the Income statement (see Note 1.36).

**38.6. Hedging derivatives on energy prices**

There was no hedging derivatives on energy price.

**38.7. Fair value of financial instruments**

Fair value hierarchy

Lecta Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial
instruments by valuation technique:

_Level 1:_ quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities

The fair value of 2012 notes was based on ex-coupon quotations. It should be considered with
caution as the High Yield Bonds market has low liquidity.

_Level 2:_ other techniques for which all inputs that have a significant effect on the recorded fair
value are observable, either directly or indirectly.

– For the hedging instruments, the inputs that have a significant effect on their fair value were
observable.

– For the other items, of which Trade receivables and Trade payables, no valuation techniques
had to be applied, as they were all short-term.

_Level 3:_ techniques that use inputs that have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that
are not based on observable market data.

It applies to Available-for-sale financial investments (see Note 19). The fair value consists in the
historical cost less eventual impairment.

**39.4. Market risk**

Lecta Group profit is affected by cyclical changes in the overall economic activity and exposed to
variations in the price of paper, raw materials and energy.

To reduce their impacts:

– Lecta Group customer base is highly diversified in terms of geography and channels of sales.

– Lecta Group produces part of its needs of pulp and base paper, the main raw material used in
the production of Coated Woodfree and Specialties. It also produces part of its energy
requirement.

– Lecta Group signed multi-year contracts of pulp or other raw materials supply.

– Lecta Group signed multi-year contracts of energy supply.

**NOTES — (Continued)**

The table below illustrates how a change in selected factors (on the assumption that other factors
are neutral) related to Lecta Group’s business may affect financial performances. Based on actual
figures of 2015:

**39.5. Currency risk on transactions**

Lecta Group’s EBITDA is exposed to the fluctuations of non-euro currencies on future sales and
purchases.

Favorable (unfavorable) impacts on EBITDA of a decrease of 0.01 of exchange rate [e.g. for USD/
EUR from 1.09 (average in 2015) to 1.08, or for GBP/EUR from 0.73 (average in 2015) to 0.72], all
other things being equal, based on actual figures of 2015, are:

**Currency** **EUR M**

USD . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . �1.6

Lecta Group covers the fluctuations of non-euro currencies, mainly USD and GBP, according to
the following rules (see Note 38.4):

– Statement of financial position approach for trade receivables and payables: on a regular basis,
the actual sales and purchases denominated in non-euro currencies are covered through
forward agreements with fixed expiry dates consistent with those of the hedged items.

Since 2007, it includes a long-term maintenance contract of Alto Garda Power denominated in
USD.

– Income statement approach for forecast incomes and expenses: on an occasional basis, a part
of the future sales and purchases to be made in non-euro currencies may be covered through
forward agreements or options for a maximum period of six months.

**39.6. Interest rate risk**

Lecta Group’s profit before tax is exposed to the fluctuations of interest rate, as a vast proportion
of its Borrowings is indexed to 3 month Euribor.

Unfavorable impact on profit before tax of an increase of 1% (100 basis points) of 3 month
Euribor [e.g. from �0.02% (average in 2015) to 0.98%], all other things being equal, based on actual
figures of 2015, is:

**Interest rate** **EUR M**

3M Euribor . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . �3.2

Lecta Group hedges part of its Borrowings in order to reduce the impact of interest rate
fluctuations (see Note 38.5). Lecta Group’s counterparts are leading financial institutions that had
credit ratings equal to or better than A-2 short-term or BBB long-term ratings (or equivalent) when the
hedging instruments were traded.

**39.7. Currency risk on investments**

Lecta Group has no significant investments in the non-euro zone.

**39.8. Currency risk on Borrowings**

The borrowings of Lecta Group are essentially denominated in euro.

**NOTES — (Continued)**

**39.9. Business risk**

Lecta Group negotiates insurance policies for major risks, such as property damage & business
interruption, and general liability. Lecta Group also invests in the prevention and the protection of its
assets following the recommendations by leading insurance companies.

**39.10. CO2 emission rights**

Lecta Group emits more CO2 than the CO2 emissions rights (‘‘ER’’) granted for free. This deficit
is covered with the stock of ER available at the end of the prior period, and the purchases of ER from
third parties. The purchase price of ER is exposed to market fluctuations.

Unfavorable impact on Lecta Group EBITDA of a price increase of ER of 1A per tonne, all other
things being equal, is EUR �0.4 M.

Lecta Group did not acquire any derivative to cover the purchase price fluctuation of ER.

**40. Events after the Statement of financial position date**

In June 2015, Alto Garda Power SrL entered into a 14-year agreement with General Electric for
the maintenance of a new gas turbine (see Note 3.9). As the payments of this agreement have to be
made in USD, in February and March 2016, Alto Garda Power SrL entered into several currency
forward contracts for the purpose of hedging the payments against any unexpected fluctuation of
exchange rate of USD until December 2017.

To the Shareholders of
Lecta S.A.

**Report on the consolidated financial statements**

Following our appointment by the General Meeting of the Shareholders dated 25 April 2014, we
have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Lecta S.A., which comprise the
consolidated statement of financial position as at 31 December 2014, the consolidated income
statement, the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the consolidated statement of changes
in equity, the consolidated cash flow statement for the year then ended, and a summary of significant
accounting policies and other explanatory information.

_Board of Directors’ responsibility for the consolidated financial statements_

The Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these
consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as
adopted by the European Union and for such internal control as the Board of Directors determines is
necessary to enable the preparation and presentation of consolidated financial statements that are free
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

_Responsibility of the ‘‘r´eviseur d’entreprises agr´e´e’’_

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our
audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing as adopted for
Luxembourg by the ‘‘Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier’’. Those standards require that
we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether the consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement.

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and
disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the judgement
of the ‘‘r´eviseurd’entreprises agr´e´e’’, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of
the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments,
the ‘‘r´eviseurd’entreprises agr´e´e’’ considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair
presentation of the consolidated financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness
of the entity’s internalcontrol. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting
policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the Board of Directors, as well
as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a
basis for our audit opinion.

_Opinion_

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial
position of Lecta S.A. as of 31 December 2014, and of its financial performance and its cash flows for
the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the
European Union.

**NOTES**

**1.** **Summary of significant accounting policies**

**1.01. Basis of preparation**

The consolidated financial statements of Lecta Group have been prepared in accordance with the
Standards and Interpretations adopted by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and by
the E.U. applicable as at 1 January 2014. They comprise:

– International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS),

– International Accounting Standards (IAS),

– Interpretations originated by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee
(IFRIC) or the former Standing Interpretations Committee (SIC).

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on an historical cost basis, except for
the measurement at fair value of Available-for-sale financial assets, Biological assets and Derivative
financial instruments. The carrying values of recognized assets and liabilities that are hedged are
adjusted to record changes in the fair values attributable to the hedged risks.

In the process of applying Lecta Group’s accounting policies, the Management has made the
following judgments:

– Each consolidated company has the ability to continue as a going concern.

– Recognition of risks through provisions (see Note 31).

– Choice of an accounting treatment when alternative methods are allowed by existing
standards.

– Choice of an accounting treatment when insufficient guidance is provided by an existing
standard (see Notes 1.16 and 1.17).

Management of Lecta Group has also made assumptions for the years to come.

Where needed Management used assumptions (inflation, interest rates, exchange rates, prices,
volumes...) to develop strategies and prepare plans.

The assumptions and the resulting plans are used in preparing the financial statements
(e.g. computation of impairment tests, recognition of Deferred income tax assets...). Actual results may
differ from these estimates.

**1.02. Changes in accounting policies — New accounting standards**

The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year except for
the following new and amended IAS, IFRS and IFRIC interpretations, effective from 1 January 2014:

– Amendments to IAS 32 — Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities

These amendments clarify the meaning of ‘‘currently has a legally enforceable right to set-off’’
and the criteria for non-simultaneous settlement mechanisms of clearing houses to qualify for
offsetting. These amendments have no material impact to the Group.

– Amendments to IAS 36 — Recoverable amount disclosure for non-financial assets

These amendments remove the unintended consequence of IFRS 13 ‘‘Fair value
measurement’’ on the disclosures required under IAS 36 ‘‘Impairment of assets’’. In addition
these amendments require disclosure of the recoverable amounts for the assets or cash
generating units (CGUs) for which an impairment loss has been recognized or reversed during
the period. The amendment affects presentation only and has no impact on the Group’s
financial position or performance.

– Amendments to IAS 39 — Novation of Derivatives and Continuation of Hedge accounting

These amendments provide relief from discontinuing hedge accounting when novation of a
derivative designated as a hedging instrument meets certain criteria. These amendments have
no material impact to the Group.

**NOTES — (Continued)**

**1.03. Basis of consolidation**

The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the parent company
Lecta SA and its subsidiaries (including Special Purpose Entities) as at 31 December each year.

Subsidiaries are entities in which Lecta Group has the sole power to exercise control over their
operations.

All the consolidated subsidiaries are listed in Note 2.2.

Certain subsidiaries (including Special Purpose Entities) of Lecta Group are however not
consolidated on the basis of immateriality (see Note 2.3).

Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to Lecta Group and
cease to be consolidated from the date on which control is transferred out of Lecta Group.

Control is achieved when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its
involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the
investee. Specifically, the Group controls an investee if, and only if, the Group has:

– Power over the investee (i.e. existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant
activities of the investee);

– Exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee;

– The ability to use its power over the investee to affect its returns.

Generally, there is a presumption that a majority of voting rights result in control. To support this
presumption and when the Group has less than a majority of the voting or similar rights of an investee,
the Group considers all relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether it has power over an
investee, including:

– The contractual arrangement with the other vote holders of the investee;

– Rights arising from other contractual arrangements;

– The Group’s voting rights and potential voting rights.

All inter-company transactions, balances and unrealized gains and losses on transactions between
Lecta Group companies are eliminated on consolidation. Where local accounting policies followed by
subsidiaries differ significantly from those adopted for the purpose of the consolidated financial
statements, appropriate adjustments are made in order to achieve a consistent basis of accounting.

**1.04. Investment in associates**

An Associate is an entity, including an unincorporated entity such as a partnership, over which
Lecta Group has significant influence but which it does not control. It is neither a subsidiary nor a joint
venture.

An associate is accounted for under the equity method of consolidation. The investment in
associate is initially recognized at cost and adjusted thereafter for the post-acquisition changes in Lecta
Group’s share of net assets of the associate. Goodwill relating to the associate is included in the
carrying amount of the investment and is neither amortized nor individually tested for impairment.

The Income statement of Lecta Group includes Lecta Group’s share of the profit or loss after tax
of the associate.

After application of the equity method, Lecta Group determines whether it is necessary to
recognize an additional impairment loss on the Group’s investment in its associates. Lecta Group
determines at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that the investment in the
associate is impaired. If this is the case, Lecta Group calculates the amount of impairment as the
difference between the recoverable amount of the associate and its carrying value, and recognizes the
amount in the line ‘‘Share of results in associates’’ of the Income statement.

Lecta Group does not consolidate any associate.

**NOTES — (Continued)**

**1.05. Interests in joint ventures**

A Joint venture is a contractual arrangement whereby Lecta Group and one or more third parties
undertake an economic activity that is subject to joint control.

A jointly controlled entity is accounted for under the equity method.

Refer to Note 1.04 for a description on the equity method.

Lecta Group does not have any joint venture, which requires consolidation.

**1.06. Glossary**

_EBITDA:_ Earnings before depreciation, amortization, non-recurring items, finance costs, net
income from associates and income tax. It includes non-cash (expenses) incomes, consisting of
variations of inventories and operating provisions. This aggregate is a key performance indicator for
Lecta Group and the paper industry.

_Non-recurring items:_ Profits, losses or costs isolated for a better understanding of the business
performance. This heading comprises essentially:

– The profit and losses on disposals or impairments of Investment in associates (see Note 1.04),
Available-for-sale financial assets (see Note 1.18), and certain long-lived assets of which
Goodwill (see Note 1.21),

– The costs of restructuring and material reorganization,

– The acquisition costs in relation with business combinations, and the profit following the
immediate recognition of negative goodwill (see Note 1.14).

**1.07. Foreign currency transactions**

The presentation currency of Lecta Group is the euro (EUR).

For each entity of Lecta Group, transactions in foreign currencies are recorded in their functional
currency at the exchange rate prevailing at the transaction date. Monetary assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate prevailing at the year-end closing
date. Exchange differences are taken to the Income statement: Foreign exchange differences for
operating business items are recorded in the line ‘‘Other operating costs except non-recurring items’’,
and financial items are recorded in the lines ‘‘Financial income’’ and ‘‘Financial expense’’.

An exception to the above would be the case of a foreign currency borrowing that would provide a
hedge against a net investment in a foreign entity. Lecta Group does not have such borrowing.

**1.08. Foreign currency translations — subsidiaries**

The Income statements of the non-euro consolidated subsidiaries are translated into euro at the
weighted average exchange rates for the year. Their assets and liabilities are translated into euro at the
exchange rate prevailing at the year-end closing date. The exchange differences are taken directly to
Equity. On disposal of the entity, the exchange differences accumulated are included in the line
‘‘Non-recurring items’’ in the Income statement as a component of the gain or loss on disposal.

Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are stated in the
currency of the acquired entity at the date of the acquisition.

Lecta Group doesn’t have any entity within the group which operates in a hyper-inflationary
economy.

**NOTES — (Continued)**

**1.09. Revenue recognition**

Revenue is recognized to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to
Lecta Group and the revenue can be reliably measured. The following specific recognition criteria must
be met before revenue is recognized:

– Sales of goods: Revenue is recognized when goods leave the warehouses of the Group or
those of the consignees, or when, the goods being ready on the contractual date, their delivery
is postponed following the customer’s request. This method enables a reliable measurement of
revenue. It acknowledges that the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have
been transferred either to the buyer or to the transporter.

– Sales of energy: Revenue is recognized when the energy is effectively supplied to the buyer.

– Interest: Revenue is recognized as interest accrues.

– Dividends: Revenue is recognized when the shareholders’ right to receive the payment is
established.

**1.10. Property, plant and equipment**

Property, plant and equipment purchased by the Lecta Group’s companies are stated at historical
cost, increased where appropriate by terminal environmental reinstatement costs (none in Lecta
Group).

When acquired through a business combination, the assets are stated at their fair value at the date
of acquisition.

The Property, plant and equipment present in Lecta Group at First Time Adoption of IFRS as at
1 January 2004, were subject to specific rules: those of Cartiere del Garda SpA were fair valued and
these fair values were used as deemed cost at that date, while the values of property, plant &
equipment of all other companies used under the previous GAAP were maintained.

At closing date, Property, plant and equipment are stated at the above-mentioned gross value less
accumulated depreciation and any impairment.

Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the following estimated useful lives:

**1.11. Maintenance**

Maintenance costs relating to an existing tangible asset are capitalized, if and only if it has a useful
life of more than one year and if it replaces an identifiable component of the existing tangible asset.
The cost represents a new component which will be depreciated individually. The depreciation will not
exceed the remaining useful life of the existing tangible asset except when it extends its useful life. This
capitalization also translates into derecognizing the replaced component.

For any given plant, the maintenance of existing Safety and Environment installations may be
necessary to continue to obtain the future economic benefits from the other assets of this plant
dedicated to production. Under such circumstances, they may qualify for recognition as Property, plant
and equipment. Should they not meet the above criteria, these costs are expensed.

F-130


-----

**NOTES — (Continued)**

Recurring maintenance or day-to-day servicing costs (outside contractors, felt & wires...) are always
expensed.

The overhauls of gas turbines of cogeneration plants are capitalized as Property, plant and
equipment and depreciated over 3 to 6 years.

**1.12. Leases**

Leases, which transfer to Lecta Group substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to
ownership of the leased item, are classified as finance leases.

Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset are
classified as operating leases.

_Finance leases are capitalized at the inception of the lease at the fair value of the leased property_
or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments. Lease payments are apportioned
between the finance charges and reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of
interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are included in the line ‘‘Finance
costs’’ of the Income statement. The lease liability is included in the line ‘‘Interest-bearing borrowings’’
of the Statement of financial position.

If there is a reasonable certainty that Lecta Group will obtain ownership by the end of the lease
term, the capitalized leases follow the same depreciation policy than the similar owned assets.
Otherwise, they are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease
term. In both cases, the depreciation is included in the line ‘‘Depreciation’’ of the Income statement.

_Operating lease payments are recognized as an expense in the line ‘‘Other operating costs except_
non-recurring items’’ of the Income statement in accordance with the terms of the lease.

**1.13. Investment properties**

Investment properties consist of land or buildings, held to earn rentals or capital appreciation.

Investment properties purchased by Lecta Group’s companies are stated at historical cost,
increased where appropriate by terminal environmental reinstatement costs (none in Lecta Group).

When acquired by Lecta Group through a business combination, they are stated at their fair value
at the date of acquisition.

At closing date, investment properties are stated at the above-mentioned gross value less
accumulated depreciation and any impairment.

Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the following estimated useful lives:

Land . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . No depreciation
Buildings . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 30 to 40 years

Investment properties in Lecta Group consisted of plots of land in Amorebieta mill, closed in
2009, a plot of land in Uranga mill and a plot of land in Sarri`a del Ter mill closed in 2014 (see
Note 16.2).

**1.14. Business combinations and goodwill**

_Business combinations from 1 January 2009 (prospective application)_

Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition
is measured as the aggregate of the consideration transferred, measured at acquisition date fair value
and the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree. For each business combination, the
acquirer measures the non-controlling interest in the acquiree either at fair value or at the
proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. Acquisition costs incurred are expensed in
the line ‘‘Non-recurring items’’ (see Notes 1.06 and 11).

F-131


-----

**NOTES — (Continued)**

When the Group acquires a business, it assesses the financial assets and liabilities assumed for
appropriate classification and designation in accordance with the contractual terms, economic
circumstances and pertinent conditions as at the acquisition date.

If the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date fair value of the acquirer’s
previously held equity interest in the acquiree is remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date
through profit or loss. Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer is recognized at
fair value at the acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration
which is deemed to be an asset or liability, are recognized in accordance with IAS 39 either in profit or
loss or as a change to other comprehensive income. If the contingent consideration is classified as
equity, it is not remeasured until it is finally settled within equity.

Goodwill is initially measured at cost being the excess of the aggregate of the consideration
transferred and the amount recognized for non-controlling interest over the net identifiable assets
acquired and liabilities assumed. If this consideration is lower than the fair value of the net assets of
the subsidiary acquired, the difference (formerly known as negative goodwill) is recognized in profit or
loss in the line ‘‘Non-recurring items’’ of the Income statement. After initial recognition, goodwill is
measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.

_Business combinations prior to 1 January 2009_

In comparison to the above-mentioned requirements, the following differences applied:

Business combinations were accounted for using the purchase method. Transaction costs directly
attributable to the acquisition formed part of the acquisition costs. The non-controlling interest (or
non-controlling interest) was measured at the proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net
assets. Business combinations achieved in stages were accounted for as separate steps. Any additional
acquired share of interest did not affect previously recognized goodwill. Contingent consideration was
recognized if, and only if, the Group had a present obligation, the economic outflow was more likely
than not and a reliable estimate was determinable. Subsequent adjustments to the contingent
consideration were recognized as part of goodwill.

**1.15. Other intangible assets**

Other intangible assets acquired separately are recognized at cost. Intangible assets acquired as
part of a business combination are recognized separately from Goodwill if the fair value can be
measured reliably on initial recognition, subject to the constraint that, unless the asset has a readily
ascertainable market value. The carrying values of intangible assets with definite useful lives are tested
for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be
recoverable. The carrying values of intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for
impairment on a yearly basis.

Research and Development costs are expensed when incurred, except for certain development
costs that are recognized when it is probable that the project will generate future economic benefits,
and the costs can be measured reliably.

Other internally generated intangible assets are not capitalized, but expensed against profit in the
year the costs were incurred.

Other intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis, over the shortest period between
their own legal duration and the useful life of the assets to which they benefit.

**1.16. CO2 emission rights**

In order to comply with the Kyoto protocol, the European Union has set up the CO2 (or
Greenhouse Gas) emission rights scheme.

Lecta Group elected to use the implicit rule of IAS 20 ‘‘Accounting for government grants and
disclosure of government assistance’’ to account for the CO2 emission rights. This rule is sometimes
referred to as ‘‘net liability method’’:

According to the ‘‘net liability method’’, the rights that have been granted free of charge by each
National Authority are not recognized. A provision at fair value is recognized for the tons of CO2
emitted in excess of the rights granted by each National Authority.

Purchased rights are initially recognized at cost in the line ‘‘Other intangible assets’’ of the
Statement of financial position.

After initial recognition, the purchased rights that are not in excess of the above-mentioned
provisioned tons are measured at fair value.

The rights in excess are kept at their historical cost, unless the market price drops below this cost.
In such a case, these rights are impaired.

All the movements in the Income statement are reported in the line ‘‘Other operating costs except
non-recurring items’’.

These rules are implemented separately for each Subsidiary, because National Authorities grant
the rights to single companies.

**1.17. Green & White certificates**

On top of selling steam and electricity to Garda mill, excess electricity to the national grid, Alto
Garda Power SrL sells hot water to the local urban heating network. This gives Alto Garda Power SrL
title to the grant of Green certificates for a period of eight years starting in January 2010. No
obligation is attached to these Green certificates.

Lecta Group elected to use the implicit rule of IAS 20 ‘‘Accounting for government grants and
disclosure of government assistance’’ to account for the Green certificates. They are recognized as an
intangible asset, initially at nominal value, until they are sold to a third party. Following a change in
Italian regulation dated 6 July 2012, the Green certificates are recognized as a non-monetary
government grant, which corresponds to GSE (Gestore dei Servizi Energetici) guaranteed price. An
additional profit can be recognized in the line ‘‘Other operating costs except non-recurring items’’ of
the Income statement upon the sale of Green certificate if the actual sales price is higher than the
guaranteed one.

Thanks to its savings in the consumption of natural gas, Alto Garda Power SrL is entitled to a
grant of White certificates for a period of ten years starting in January 2012. No obligation is attached
to these White certificates.

Lecta Group elected to use the implicit rule of IAS 20 ‘‘Accounting for government grants and
disclosure of government assistance’’ to account for the White certificates. They are are recognized as a
non-monetary government grant, which corresponds to GSE (Gestore dei Servizi Energetici)
guaranteed price. An additional profit can be recognized in the line ‘‘Other operating costs except

**NOTES — (Continued)**

non-recurring items’’ of the Income statement upon the sale of Green certificate if the actual sales
price is higher than the guaranteed one (see Note 3.7).

**1.18. Financial assets**

Financial assets are accounted for by considering the four categories defined by IAS 39, Financial
instruments recognition and measurement:

– Available-for-sale financial assets,

– Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss,

– Held-to-maturity investments,

– Loans and receivables,

Initially, all financial assets are recognized at their fair value, plus in the case of a Financial asset
not at fair value through profit or loss transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition or issue
of the said financial asset.

Then the accounting rules differ from one category to another:

_Available-for-sale financial assets are acquired to be held for an indefinite period of time but may_
be sold due to changed strategic decisions.

After initial recognition, they are measured at fair value.

Gains or losses are directly recognized in the line ‘‘Net incomes (expenses) recognized directly
through Equity’’ of the Statement of financial position, until the investment is sold, collected or
otherwise disposed of, or until the investment is determined to be impaired, at which time the
cumulative gain or loss previously reported in Equity is included in the line ‘‘Non-recurring items’’ of
the Income statement.

Call and put options on shares of non-consolidated companies (derivatives held for trading) are
accounted for at fair value in the lines ‘‘Other receivables’’ or ‘‘Other payables’’ of the Statement of
financial position. Changes in the fair value are entered in the line ‘‘Non-recurring items’’ of the
Income statement.

In Lecta Group, Available-for-sale investments are shares in companies that are not consolidated
on the basis of immateriality or because of the low ownership. They are reported in the line
‘‘Available-for-sale financial investments’’, in Non-current assets of the Statement of financial position.

_Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss include financial assets held for trading and_
financial assets designated upon initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss. Financial assets
are classified as held for trading if they are acquired for the purpose of selling or repurchasing in the
near term.

After initial recognition, they are measured at fair value.

Gains or losses are recognized in the lines ‘‘Financial income’’ and ‘‘Financial expense’’ of the
Income statement.

In Lecta Group, Investments at fair value through the profit or loss are money market funds used
to safely invest temporary excess cash. They are included in the line ‘‘Cash and cash equivalents’’, in
the Current assets of the Statement of financial position.

_Held-to-maturity investments are acquired with the intent to hold them to their fixed maturity_
(e.g. bonds).

Held-to-maturity investments are included in the line ‘‘Other non-current receivables’’, in the
Non-current assets of the Statement of financial position.

F-134


-----

**NOTES — (Continued)**

After initial recognition, they are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate
method. Amortized cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition,
over the period to maturity.

Gains and losses are recognized in the line ‘‘Finance costs’’ of the Income statement when the
investments are derecognized or impaired, as well as through the amortization process.

Lecta Group does not hold such investments.

_Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that_
are not quoted in an active market.

After initial recognition, they are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate
method. Amortized cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition,
over the period to maturity.

Gains and losses are recognized in the line ‘‘Non-recurring items ‘‘of the Income statement when
the investments are derecognized or impaired, as well as through the amortization process.

This category comprises for Lecta Group:

– the Trade receivables (see Note 1.23);

– the financial investments originated by the group included in the line ‘‘Other non-current
assets’’ in the Non-current assets of the Statement of financial position (see Notes 1.25 and
1.34):

– deposits,

– guarantees,

– loans to non-consolidated companies or third parties.

_Date of recognition_

All sales and purchases of financial assets are recognized using the settlement date, i.e. the date
the asset is delivered to or received from the counterpart.

Included in this category are all sales or purchases of financial assets that require delivery of assets
within the timeframe generally established by regulation or convention in the market place.

_Derecognition_

See Note 1.37.

**1.19. Biological assets**

In Lecta Group, biological assets are limited to standing timber. The latter is exclusively dedicated
to internal consumption for the production of pulp.

They are reported in the line ‘‘Biological assets’’, under Non-current assets of the Statement of
financial position. They are measured at fair value.

**1.20. Non-current assets held for sale**

A non-current asset is held for sale if its carrying amount will be recovered principally through a
sale transaction rather than through continuing use. For this to be the case, the asset must be available
for immediate sale in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sales
of such assets and its sale must be highly probable.

The non-current assets classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying
amount and their fair value less costs to sell. They are not depreciated any more. They are presented
separately from the other assets in the Statement of financial position.

F-135


-----

**NOTES — (Continued)**

**1.21. Impairment of certain long-lived assets**

Property, plant and equipment, Investment properties and Other intangible assets are reviewed for
impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be
recoverable. This review is done each year for the Goodwill and other indefinite life intangible assets.
Where the carrying values exceed the estimated recoverable amount, the asset or the associated
cash-generating unit is written down to its recoverable amount.

The recoverable amount is the greater of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing
value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax
discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific
to the asset. For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable
amount is determined for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.

Impairment losses are recognized in the line ‘‘Non-recurring items’’ in the Income statement.

**1.22. Inventories**

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost includes materials, direct
labor and an attributable proportion of manufacturing overheads based on normal levels of activity.
Cost is computed according to the weighted average cost method. Net realizable value is based on
estimated selling price, less further costs expected to be incurred to completion and disposal.

Given the lack of meaningful market references, the inventoried spare parts are impaired in
accordance with slow moving rules reflecting their obsolescence.

**1.23. Trade receivables**

Trade receivables are recognized and carried at original invoice amount less an allowance for
uncollectable amounts.

An estimate for doubtful debts is made when collection of part or all of a receivable is no longer
probable. Bad debts are written off when identified.

**1.24. Prepayments**

This heading comprises payments to trade or other payables for future benefits such as insurance
premiums, maintenance expenses and rents. Prepayments are stated at their nominal value.

**1.25. Other receivables**

This heading comprises:

– Loans,

– Deposits and guarantees,

– Grants receivables,

– Capital receivables on the sale of long-lived assets,

– Shareholders receivables (e.g. on capital increase),

– Dividends receivables,

– Favorable options on non-consolidated companies,

– Favorable currency hedging,

– Favorable interest rate hedging,

– Favorable energy price hedging,

– Miscellaneous other receivables (e.g. expected reimbursement through an insurance contract).

F-136

**NOTES — (Continued)**

**1.26. Cash and cash equivalents**

This heading comprises:

– Cash in hand,

– Cash in banks’ current accounts,

– Short-term deposits and certificates of deposit with an original maturity of three months or
less,

– Marketable securities (Government bonds, Treasury bills and similar short-term securities).

Any gains and losses on Cash and cash equivalents are recognized in the Income statement, under
the lines ‘‘Financial income’’ and ‘‘Financial expense’’.

Note: In the Cash flow statement, the analysis is focused on variation of Cash and cash equivalents
_net of Bank overdrafts._

**1.27. Interest-bearing borrowings and Bank overdrafts**

Initially, all financial liabilities are recognized at their fair value, plus in the case of a Financial
liability not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the
acquisition or issue of the financial liability.

After initial recognition, they are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate
method. Amortized cost is calculated by taking into account any issue costs and any discount or
premium on settlement.

Gains and losses are recognized in the lines ‘‘Financial income’’ and ‘‘Financial expense’’ of the
Income statement, when the liabilities are derecognized or impaired, as well as through the
amortization process.

Lecta Group applies IAS 23 (revised) — Borrowing Costs as of 1 January 2009. Since the related
criteria were not met in 2009 and 2010, Lecta Group did not recognize any borrowing cost in the
long-lived assets until 31 December 2010. In 2011, some borrowing cost in the long-lived assets were
capitalized (see Note 12).

_Financial liabilities at fair value through the profit or loss include financial liabilities held for trading_
and financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition as at fair value through profit or loss.

Financial liabilities are classified as held for trading if they are acquired for the purpose of selling
in the near term. Derivatives, including separated embedded derivatives are also classified as held for
trading unless they are designated as effective hedging instruments.

After initial recognition, they are measured at fair value.

Gains or losses are recognized in the lines ‘‘Financial income’’ and ‘‘Financial expense’’ of the
Income statement.

In Lecta Group, no financial liabilities were designated as at fair value through profit or loss.

**1.28. Grants**

Grants constitute deferred income related to Property, plant and equipment, or Borrowings with
off-market interest rates. Grants are recognized at their fair value. They are released on a straight-line
basis in the line ‘‘Depreciation’’ of the Income statement, over the expected useful life of the relevant
asset.

**1.29. Provisions**

Provisions are recognized when:

– Lecta Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event; and

– It is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to
settle the obligation; and

F-137


-----

**NOTES — (Continued)**

– A reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made.

Where Lecta Group expects the impact of a provision to be neutralized, for example under an
insurance contract, a separate asset is recognized when it is virtually certain.

If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the
expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value
of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.

Where discounting is used, the change of the provision due to the time value of money is
recognized in the lines ‘‘Financial income’’ or ‘‘Financial expense’’ in the Income statement.

**1.30. Employee benefits**

Lecta Group’s employees take advantage of various benefits schemes:

– Short-term employee benefits:

These include wages, salaries, paid holidays, social contributions, sick leave, compensated
absences, bonuses, profit sharing and non-monetary benefits, all paid within 12 months after
service is rendered.

– Defined contribution post-employment plans:

The cost to the employer is fixed and predictable.

The charge for the period is the contribution due in respect of the service rendered during the
period. Payments in advance are reported in the line ‘‘Prepayments’’ of the Statement of
financial position. Payments in arrears are reported in the line ‘‘Trade payables’’ of the
Statement of financial position. Any accrual that does not fall due within 12 months beyond
Statement of financial position date is discounted and recognized at its present value.

– Defined benefit post-employment plans:

The employer retains a risk of additional contributions to be paid.

The plan is valued in the Statement of financial position at the present value of the obligation
less the fair value of any plan assets legally separate from the employer.

Any unrecognized past service costs, is immediately recognized.

All actuarial gains or losses are immediately recognized.

For any curtailment or settlement, the resulting change is immediately recognized.

– Other long-term benefits:

These include long-service or jubilee benefits.

All actuarial gains or losses and any past service costs are immediately recognized.

– Termination benefits:

These include early retirement schemes or redundancy programs.

They are recognized as a liability and an expense when and only when a company of Lecta
Group is demonstrably committed to terminate the employment of a group of employees
before the normal retirement date or provide termination benefits as a result of an offer made
to encourage voluntary redundancy.

Lecta Group employees do not benefit from Equity compensation benefits plan or share based
payments plan.

The employee benefits may be funded, resulting in a debt obligation with financial institutions, or
unfunded, resulting in the booking of a provision. Independent qualified actuaries review any material
long-term obligation of Lecta Group.

F-138


-----

**NOTES — (Continued)**

The costs are accounted for as follows:

– The actuarial gains and losses of Defined benefit post-employment plans are directly
recognized in the lines ‘‘Net incomes (expenses) recognized directly through Equity’’ and
‘‘Deferred tax’’ of the Statement of financial position.

– All the other costs are recognized in the Income statement, in the following lines:

– Costs related to active employees: ‘‘Labor costs’’.

– Costs related to retired people: ‘‘Other operating costs except non-recurring items’’.

– Costs due to the time value of money: ‘‘Financial expense’’.

**1.31. Income tax payable**

Income tax payable includes withholding tax.

**1.32. Deferred tax**

Deferred tax is provided, using the liability method, on all temporary differences at the Statement
of financial position date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for
financial reporting purposes.

Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for all taxable temporary differences (e.g. accelerated tax
depreciation, deductible legal revaluation), except (i) where the deferred tax liability arises from the
initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business
combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit
or loss, or (ii) in respect of taxable temporary differences that will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Deferred tax assets are recognized for all deductible temporary differences (e.g. employee benefits
paid to financial institutions for which the deductibility is deferred), carry forward of unused tax credits
and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available to use these
assets. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to
the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part
of the deferred tax asset to be utilized. Unrecognized deferred tax assets are reassessed at each
reporting date and are recognized to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profits
will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the
period when the asset is realized or the liability settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have
been enacted or substantively enacted at the Statement of financial position date.

Deferred tax relating to items recognized outside the Income statement is also recognized outside
the Income statement, i.e. in the Statement of comprehensive income or directly in Equity in the
Statement of financial position.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset, if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current
tax assets against current income tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity
and the same taxation authority.

**1.33. Trade payables**

This heading comprises:

– Trade payables,

– Employees and social charges,

– VAT and other taxes except Income tax and withholding tax,

– Any accruals on the above.

F-139


-----

**NOTES — (Continued)**

**1.34. Other payables**

This heading comprises:

– Capital payables following the purchase of long-lived assets,

– Shareholders payables (e.g. on capital redemption),

– Dividends payables,

– Options on Minorities of consolidated companies (see Note 1.35),

– Unfavorable options on non-consolidated companies,

– Unfavorable currency hedging,

– Unfavorable interest rate hedging,

– Unfavorable energy price hedging,

– Miscellaneous other payables (non-recurring items).

**1.35. Options on Minorities of consolidated companies**

Options on Minorities of consolidated companies are Equity derivatives:

A premium paid or received on equity derivatives at inception is recorded in Equity in a specific
line ‘‘Equity derivatives’’. Up to now, Lecta Group did not pay such premiums.

The discounted value of the exercise price of a sold option or a firm commitment, at inception and
at each year-end, is recorded in the line ‘‘Other payables’’ against the line ‘‘Non-controlling interests’’.

Since 1 January 2009 and in accordance with IAS27 (revised), when a sold option or a firm
commitment on minorities is exercised, the amount in Other payables is reversed against Cash, and the
remaining balances of non-controlling interest s and Equity derivatives are reversed against Equity.

**1.36. Derivative hedging instruments**

Lecta Group uses derivative instruments to hedge foreign currency, interest rate and energy price
fluctuations. Such derivative instruments are stated at their fair values as communicated by the financial
institutions and the energy companies that are the counterparties to these transactions.

For accounting purposes, derivative instruments are classified in the three following categories:

– _Fair value hedges: to cover the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or_
liability.

In Lecta Group, these are forward agreements on realized day-to-day sales and purchases in
non-euro currencies. Any gain or loss from re-measuring the hedging instrument at fair value
is recognized in the line ‘‘Other operating costs except non-recurring items ‘‘of the Income
statement against ‘‘Trade receivables’’ or ‘‘Trade payables’’.

– _Cash flow hedges: to cover the exposure to variability in cash flows that is attributable to a_
particular risk associated with a forecast transaction.

In Lecta Group, these could be the interest rate, exchange rate and energy price swaps, caps,
floors, collars, options. The portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is
determined to be an effective hedge is recognized directly in the line ‘‘Net incomes (expenses)
recognized directly through Equity’’ of the Statement of financial position against ‘‘Other
receivables’’ or ‘‘Other payables’’. It is removed from Equity when the hedged item affects the
Income statement. The ineffective portion of gain or loss is immediately recognized in the line
‘‘Non-recurring items’’ of the Income statement.

– _Hedges of net investments in foreign entities denominated in a non-euro currency:_

In Lecta Group, there is no such instrument.

The accounting treatment is the same as for Cash flow hedges.

**NOTES — (Continued)**

**1.37. Derecognition of financial assets and liabilities**

_Financial assets_

A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of group of similar
financial assets) is derecognized when:

a) The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired; or

b) The Group retains the right to receive cash flows from the asset, but has assumed an obligation to
pay them in full without material delay to a third party under a pass through arrangement; or

c) The Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset and either (i) has
transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or (ii) has neither transferred nor
retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.

Where the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from an asset and has neither
transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset nor transferred control of
the asset, the asset is recognized to the extent of the Group’s continuing involvement in the asset.
Continuing involvement that takes the form of a guarantee over the transferred asset is measured at
the lower of the original carrying amount of the asset and the maximum amount of consideration that
the Group could be required to repay.

Where continuing involvement takes the form of a written and / or purchased option (including a
cash settled option or similar provision) on the transferred asset, the extent of the Group’s continuing
involvement is the amount of the transferred asset that the Group may repurchase, except that in the
case of a written put option (including a cash settled option or similar provision) on an asset measured
at fair value, the extent of the Group’s continuing involvement is limited to the lower of the fair value
of the transferred asset and the option exercise price.

_Financial liabilities_

A financial liability is derecognized when the obligation under the liability is discharged or
cancelled or expired.

**1.38. Future changes in accounting policies**

New amended IAS or interpretations effective as of 1 January 2015:

– IFRIC 21 Levies — IFRIC 21 is an interpretation of IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities
and Contingent Assets. IAS 37 sets out criteria for the recognition of a liability, one of which
is the requirement for the entity to have a present obligation as a result of a past event
(known as an obligating event). The Interpretation clarifies that the obligating event that gives
rise to a liability to pay a levy is the activity described in the relevant legislation that triggers
the payment of the levy. The group is subject to some levies but the impact is zero at
year-end.

– IAS 19 Defined benefit plans — Employee Contributions (Amendments to IAS 19). The
pronouncement amends IAS 19 Employee Benefits (2011) to clarify the requirements that
relate to how contributions from employees or third parties that are linked to service should
be attributed to periods of service. In addition, it permits a practical expedient if the amount
of the contributions is independent of the number of years of service, in that contributions,
can, but are not required, to be recognized as a reduction in the service cost in the period in
which the related service is rendered.

– In December 2013, the IASB issued Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2011-2013 Cycle, a
collection of amendments to IFRSs, in response to four issues addressed during the 2011-2013
cycle. The amendments reflect issues discussed by the IASB during the project cycle that
began in 2011, and that were subsequently included in the Exposure Draft of proposed
amendments to IFRSs, Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2011-2013 Cycle. The UE endorsed
them on 17 December 2014. The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on
or after 1 January 2015, although entities are permitted to apply them earlier

**NOTES — (Continued)**

New amended IAS or interpretations effective as of 1 January 2016:

– In December 2013, the IASB issued Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2010-2012 Cycle, a
collection of amendments to IFRSs, in response to eight issues addressed during the
2010-2012 cycle. The UE endorsed them on 17 December 2014. The amendments reflect
issues discussed by the IASB during the project cycle that began in 2010, and that were
subsequently included in the exposure draft of proposed amendments to IFRSs, Annual
Improvements to IFRSs 2010-2012 Cycle. The amendments are effective for annual periods
beginning on or after 1 February 2015, although entities are permitted to apply them earlier.

Lecta Group is evaluating the effects of the above standards applicable as from 1 January 2015
and 1 January 2016 and expects that their adoption will have no material impact on the financial
statements

**3.4. Organization efficiency program**

The integration process covers Lecta industrial operations in Italy, France and Spain, as well as the
paper merchanting ones in the same countries and, additionally, Portugal.

Within the Organization efficiency program, Lecta planned several cost reduction initiatives. The
program launched at the end of 2012 aims at EUR 42 M fixed costs savings per year of which
EUR 29 M were obtained in 2014. Total restructuring cash cost over the period 2012-2015 is estimated
at EUR (31) M.

For the year 2014 the restructuring cash cost associated to Lecta efficiency programs was
EUR (14.1) M, reported in the line ‘‘Non-recurring items’’ (see Note 11). After payments, as at
31 December 2014, the remaining provision for restructuring was EUR 7.6 M (see Note 31).

**3.4.1. Summary of the cost reduction initiatives since the end of 2012**

The cost reduction initiatives included:

– Agreement with Cartiere del Garda employees to reduce labor cost through the conversion of
part of fixed into variable salary linked to the performance of the company (February 2013);

– Reorganization of the Paper merchanting structure in Italy, Portugal, and Spain with total
headcount reduction of 137 (until March 2013);

– Harmonization of the bonus scheme indexed to EBITDA performance (March 2013),
cancellation of pension fund schemes (May 2013) and mill special agreements (July 2013) in
Spain;

– Permanent closure of Condat production line n�6 (with a production capacity of 130,000 tons
of CWF) with a job position reduction of 139 (June 2013)

– Denunciation of Progil pension regime to active employees in Condat (June 2013); this
denunciation led to a one-off reduction of the provision for defined benefit post-employment
plans of EUR 8.0 M reported in the line ‘‘Labor costs’’ in September 2013;

– Curtailment of the provision for Retirement plan IFC following the implementation of the
restructuring in Condat; the one-off reduction of the provision for defined benefit
post-employment plans of EUR 1.5 M was reported in the line ‘‘Labor costs’’ in September
2013, and EUR 0.2 M in December 2013;

– Denunciation of labor side agreements in Condat (December 2013) related to the working
time and the structure of the remuneration. Condat’s management is negotiating with the
unions a new set of labor side agreements designed to promote the company performance,
and the individual and collective efforts.

– Reorganization of the Paper merchanting structure in Italy and France aiming at centralizing
the management and administration activities, adapting the structure to the reduced size of
the market, outsourcing the transportation activity, reorganizing the logistic services with the
closure of 3 warehouses in December 2013 and 1 in August 2014, associated to a job position
reduction of 78 (until August 2014);

**NOTES — (Continued)**

– Sarri`a de Ter paper mill (with a production capacity of 65,000 tons of base paper and UWF)
and Cogeneraci´on del Ter plant (with a power of 25MW), with a job position reduction of 132
(October 2014);

– Centralization of the group financial activities in Barcelona with a job position reduction of 4
(October 2014).

**3.4.2. Condat’s restructuring (France)**

The Management of Condat SAS presented on 22 March 2013 to its Works Council a
comprehensive restructuring plan aiming at the permanent closure of the production line n�6 (with a
production capacity of 130,000 tons of CWF). The negotiations were successfully completed in June
2013 and the implementation of the restructuring plan started with the permanent closure of the
production line n�6 on 1 July 2013. The restructuring plan entailed a job position reduction of 139.

An impairment of the Line 6 tangible assets of EUR (12.0) M was recorded in December 2012 in
the line ‘‘Non-recurring items’’. It was complemented by an impairment of the Line 6 spare parts of
EUR (0.7) M in June 2013. Then, the transfer of Line 6 standard components to the stock of spare
parts and an adjustment of the initial impairment partly offset the impairment charge by EUR 5.3 M in
December 2013. The impairment charge of Line 6 spare parts was reduced by EUR 0.4 M in
December 2014. The total net impairment charge over the period amounted to EUR (7.0) M (see
Note 11).

A provision for restructuring of EUR (11.0) M was also booked in the line ‘‘Non-recurring items’’
in March 2013 (see Note 11).

**3.4.3. Torraspapel’s restructuring (Spain)**

In the context of the reallocation of its production capacities, in 2013 Lecta decided to install a
second-hand Paper Machine n�7 in its Zaragoza mill. PM7 is producing base paper to be converted into
specialty papers by Leitza plant. The investment aims at maximizing the use of pulp produced on the
site, thus reducing drying and transportation costs of pulp to other mills.

This decision led to the permanent closure of Berrobi / Uranga mill (with a production capacity of
27,000 tons of base paper) at the end of January 2014.

An Impairment of Berrobi / Uranga tangible assets of EUR (4.7) M was recorded in June 2013,
complemented by EUR (0.5) M in December 2013. The total impairment charge of EUR (5.2) M was
reported in the line ‘‘Non-recurring items’’ (see Note 11).

This decision also led the Management of Torraspapel SA to present on 30 April 2014 to the
Works Council an economic and technical report about the lack of competitiveness of the activities in
Sarri`a de Ter paper mill (with a production capacity of 65,000 tons of base paper and UWF) and
Cogeneraci´on del Ter plant (with a power of 25MW). The negotiations about the restructuring plan of
Sarri`a were successfully completed in June 2014, and the paper production definitely ended on
3 October 2014. The plan entailed a job position reduction of 132.

An impairment of the tangible assets and spare parts of the site in Sarri`a de Ter, amounting to
EUR (24.7) M, was reported in the line ‘‘Non-recurring items’’ in December 2013 (see Note 11).

The total restructuring cost of EUR (13.9) M was reported in the line ‘‘Non-recurring items’’ (see
Note 11).

**3.4.4. Torraspapel Malmenayde and Nord Papier’s restructuring (France)**

The Management of Torraspapel Malmenayde S`arl presented on 28 June 2013 to its Works
Council a comprehensive restructuring plan aiming the outsourcing of Torraspapel Malmenayde
transportation activity. The negotiations were successfully completed in October 2013 and the
implementation of the restructuring started in November 2013. The restructuring plan entailed a job
position reduction of 17.

A provision for restructuring of EUR (0.8) M was reported in the line ‘‘Non-recurring items’’ in
June 2013. The unused provision of EUR 0.1 M was released in December 2013 (see Note 11).

**NOTES — (Continued)**

The Management of Torraspapel Malmenayde S`arl presented on 23 June 2014 to its Works
Council a comprehensive restructuring plan aiming the reorganization of the warehousing and logistics
services of the company and Nord Papier SA. The negotiations were successfully completed in July
2014 and the implementation of the restructuring was initiated in August 2014. The restructuring plan
entailed the closure of the warehouse in Seclin and a job position reduction of 8.

A restructuring cost of EUR (0.5) M was reported in the line ‘‘Non-recurring items’’, and spread
over the period August to November 2014 (see Note 11).

**3.4.5. Polyedra’s restructuring (Italy)**

Polyedra’s restructuring consists in two plans: Mobilit`a 1 (ended in 2013) and Mobilit`a 2 (ended in
2014).

An unused provision of EUR 0.4 M in relation with Mobilit`a 1 initiated prior to Polyedra’s
acquisition was released in September 2013 in the line ‘‘Non-recurring items’’ (see Note 11).

The Management of Polyedra presented on 20 June 2013 to its Trade Unions a comprehensive
restructuring plan aiming the centralization of the management and administration activities in Milano,
the adaptation of the structure to the reduced size of the Italian market, and some reorganization in
the logistic services.

The plan was opened until 15 September 2014, date on which 50 employees had left the company
with Mobilit`a 2, 3 were incentivized to leave the company, and 2 agent contracts were terminated. The
warehouses in Firenze, Torino and Genova were closed in December 2013.

In June 2013, a provision for restructuring of EUR (3.0) M and an impairment in tangible asset of
EUR (0.15) M were reported in the line ‘‘Non-recurring items’’. In December 2014, the unused
provision of EUR 0.5 M was released, and the impairment charge was reduced by EUR 0.09 M (see
Note 11).

**3.5. Royal decree and Ministerial order applicable to Spanish cogeneration plants**

**3.5.1. Reduction in Revenue of energy**

The Royal decree n�413/2014 and the Ministerial order n�IET/1045/2014,were published on 10 and
20 June 2014. They cover the retribution to be perceived by the Spanish cogeneration plants when
selling electricity to the grid.

For the period from 14 July to 31 December 2013, Lecta considered a provisional reduction in
‘‘Sales of energy’’ of EUR (4.4) M in December 2013. As the actual reduction was ultimately limited to
EUR (3.2) M, a favorable variance of EUR 1.2 M was booked, EUR 0.9 M in June 2014 and
EUR 0.3 M in September 2014 (see Note 8).

From January to September 2014, Lecta considered a provisional reduction in ‘‘Sales of energy’’ of
circa EUR (1.0) M per month, totaling EUR (8.7) M for the 9-month period ending on 30 September
2014. As at 31 December 2014 there is no more uncertainty regarding the sale of energy by the Spanish
cogeneration plants (see Note 8).

**3.5.2. Reversal of impairment of some Cogeneraci´on Motril’s assets**

As the draft Royal decree affected the future cash flows of Cogeneraci´on Motril SA, Lecta decided
to impair its tangible assets and its stock of spare parts, and booked an impairment charge of
EUR (4.5) M in December 2013.

As the cogeneration mill will continue running for the benefit of the Motril’s paper mill, the
impairment charge of EUR 4.5 M was reversed (see Note 11) and the depreciation cost of
EUR (0.6) M was booked (see Note 9) in December 2014.

**3.6. Non-recognition of some deferred tax assets**

The uncertainties in short-term future profitability, led to the non-recognition of some deferred tax
assets (see Notes 13 and 32.3). In 2014, the impact was EUR (4.2) M in Condat Holding tax group
(France), and EUR (9.3) M in Lecta HQ tax group (Spain).

**3.7. White certificates**

Thanks to its high efficiency, Alto Garda Power SrL is entitled to a grant of White certificates for
a period of ten years starting in January 2012. No obligation is attached to these White certificates.

For the 2-year period 2012-2013, the White certificates granted to Alto Garda Power SrL
generated a profit of EUR 5.3 M reported in the line ‘‘Other operating costs except non-recurring
items’’ in December 2013.

Thanks to an actual sales price higher than the guaranteed one considered in December 2013, the
sale of 2012-2013 White certificates generated an additional profit of EUR 1.9 M in 2014. Accordingly
profits of EUR 1.2 M in March and EUR 0.7 M in October were reported in the line ‘‘Other operating
costs except non-recurring items’’.

**4.** **Significant events of 2013**

The present chapter is an extract of the items disclosed in the Annual report of 2013.

**4.1. Renewal of the Board authorization to increase the share capital**

The Extraordinary general meeting of 25 April 2013 renewed the authorization granted to the
Board of Directors to increase, for an additional period of five years the subscribed share capital of
Lecta within the limits of the authorized capital of the company.

On 31 December 2013, the subscribed Share capital was composed of 560,366 shares with a par
value of EUR 2.58 representing EUR 1,446 K, all shares being fully paid.

The Board of Directors is authorized, during a period of five years ending on 24 April 2018, to
increase once or several times the subscribed Share capital within the limits of the authorized Share
capital up to an amount of EUR 1,665 K, i.e. by the issuance of up to 85,082 new shares all with a par
value of EUR 2.58, representing EUR 220 K.

The Board of Directors is authorized, within the authorized Share capital, to issue and sell 90,399
warrants entitling the holders to subscribe for up to 90,399 new shares. At 31 December 2013, 90,378
warrants had been issued and sold, of which 69,878 had expired and 8,004 had been exercised. The
remaining 12,496 warrants had different rights of conversion, subject to conditions precedent, entitling
holders to subscribe up to 7,246 shares.

**4.2. Swap on interest rates**

On 3 May 2013, the interest rate of 26% of the Floating rate notes issued in May 2012 was hedged
with a Swap to exchange 3-month Euribor variable rate against fixed rate of 0.385% for the period
from mid-August 2013 to mid-February 2016. This Swap complements the Caps already in place (see
Note 38.5).

(France), and EUR (12.9) M in Lecta HQ tax group (Spain).

**4.4. Change in the consolidation perimeter**

**4.4.1. Sale of Argentinean paper distributor Torraspapel Argentina SA**

obtain import licenses, and risk of devaluation of the local currency (ARS).

The sale to the Tecnomax group of Uruguay was finalized on 10 December 2013, as well as the

The sale enabled Lecta to cash EUR 6.2 M for the shares in Torraspapel Argentina SA and to
reduce its interest-bearing debt net of cash by EUR 1.8 M. Lecta reported a capital loss of
EUR (2.5) M because of the recognition of EUR (3.8) M of unrealized Foreign currency translation
associated to Torraspapel Argentina SA (see Note 11).

**5.** **Information by Operating Segment**

**Year 2014**

(1) Impact of local rates:

– The local tax rates in the current year were generally close to the Luxembourg actual nominal
tax rate of 29.22%. Applied to the sum of locally computed profit (loss) before tax, negative
in 2014, the difference in tax rates generated a slight impact of EUR (9) K.

– The local tax rates in the forthcoming years will decrease in Spain, from 30% in 2014, to 28%
in 2015 and 25% in 2016. Applied to the deferred tax as at 31 December 2014, it generates an
impact of EUR (4,221) K.

(2) Adjustments on usable tax losses:

– Some deferred tax assets on tax losses were not recognized for a total of EUR (15,662) K (see
Notes 3.6 and 13.1)

(3) Permanent differences on tax bases:

– Non-deductible depreciation generated an impact of EUR 726 K

– Thin capitalization rules on Financial expense generated an impact of EUR (9,303) K

– Other definitively non-taxable profits or non-deductible expenses resulted in an impact of
EUR (1,306) K

(4) Other adjustments included:

– The IRAP (‘‘Imposta Regionale sulle Attivita Produttive’’) was computed on a larger base
than the taxable earnings in Italy, leading to an favorable impact of EUR (290) K (see
Note 32.3);

– The CVAE (‘‘Cotisation sur la Valeur Ajout´ee des Entreprises’’) was computed on a larger
base than the taxable earnings in France, leading to an unfavorable impact of EUR (862) K
(see Note 32.3);

– The deferred tax asset on tax credit related to the sale of a building was derecognized for
EUR (6,143) K.

**Year 2013**

(1) Impact of local rates:

– The local tax rates (actual and deferred) were generally higher than the Luxembourg actual
nominal tax rate. Applied to the sum of locally computed profit (loss) before tax, negative in
2013, the difference in tax rates generated a favorable impact of EUR 1,745 K;

F-160


-----

**NOTES — (Continued)**

– The change in tax rates from 2012 to 2013 had an impact of EUR 310 K.

(2) Adjustments on usable tax losses:

– Some deferred tax assets on tax losses were not recognized for a total of EUR (21,900) K (see
Notes 4.3 and 13.1);

– There were some adjustments on tax losses for a total of EUR (3,086) K.

(3) Permanent differences on tax bases:

– Non-deductible depreciations costs for a total of EUR (1,407) K;

– Non-deductible impairment of some assets for a total of EUR (2,439) K;

– Thin capitalization rules on Financial expense generated an unfavorable impact of EUR
(10,111) K;

– Other definitively non-taxable profits resulted in a favorable impact of EUR 359 K.

(4) Other adjustments:

– The IRAP (‘‘Imposta Regionale sulle Attivita Produttive’’) was computed on a larger base
than the taxable earnings in Italy, leading to an favorable impact of EUR 3,034 K (see
Note 32.3);

– The CVAE (‘‘Cotisation sur la Valeur Ajout´ee des Entreprises’’) was computed on a larger
base than the taxable earnings in France, leading to an unfavorable impact of EUR (353) K
(see Note 32.3);

– The transfer of assets within Lecta group generated a taxable capital gain, eliminated in the
consolidation, while the use of tax losses was not. This led to an unfavorable adjustment of
EUR (8,230) K;

– The sale of Torraspapel Argentina SA (see Note 4.4.1) led to the recognition of EUR (3,802)
K unrealized Foreign currency translation. This led to an unfavorable impact of EUR
(1,138)�K;

– Some miscellaneous adjustments generated a net unfavorable impact of EUR (986) K.

‘‘Basic earnings per share’’ were computed on the basis of the weighted average number of shares
issued after deduction of the weighted average number of shares owned by Lecta Group consolidated
companies (none for these two years).

‘‘Diluted earnings per share’’ took into account share equivalents having a dilutive effect after
deduction of the weighted average number of share equivalents owned by Lecta Group consolidated
companies. The dilutive effect of warrants was calculated using the notional investment method for
which the Net earnings were adjusted to include a notional after tax interest income on proceeds
coming from the sale of warrants.

**Impairment test of Goodwill:**

In consideration of the integrated organization of Lecta focused on production and sale of paper
only, the volume of intragroup transactions, the interchangeability of products between mills, Lecta
considers one cash-generating unit. Consequently, goodwill was tested for impairment at Group level
only.

This is consistent with the Note 5 prepared in accordance with IFRS 8 ‘‘Operating Segments’’.

The recoverable amount of this cash-generating unit has been determined based on value-in-use
calculation (see Note 1.21). This was produced based upon 2015 to 2018 cash-flow projections part of
Lecta financial plan, as approved by Lecta Group Management.

As mentioned in Note 1.01, Lecta Group Management made assumptions for the years to come.
Conservative assumptions on the annual growth rate were applied to the cash flow projections beyond
2017. The WACC rate applied to cash flow projections was 9.7%.

On 31 December 2014, the impairment test was successfully passed and no impairment was
recognized.

A sensitivity analysis showed that:

– An increase of 100 bps of the WACC rate applied to cash flow projections, from 9.7% to
10.7%, everything else being equal, has an unfavorable impact of EUR 69 M. It would result
in impairment of the Goodwill.

– A reduction of 10% in EBITDA applied to the period 2015 to 2018 and beyond 2018,
everything else being equal, has an unfavorable impact of EUR 63 M. It would not result in
impairment of the Goodwill.

**NOTES — (Continued)**

partner in IDAE Sant Joan AIE until it recovers its investment plus a remuneration of 3-month
Euribor + 4%.

Once the first five years as of start-off of the cogeneration plant (August 2011) have elapsed,
Torraspapel SA may also request the assignment of IDAE’s share participation in IDAE Sant Joan
AIE. For that purpose, Torraspapel SA would have to pay IDAE an amount equal to its investment
plus the referred remuneration once deducted any amounts already reimbursed to IDAE by any means.

In both cases, assignment is only possible if:

– All loans granted to of IDAE Sant Joan AIE by any third parties have been previously repaid

– Or the relevant creditors specifically waive all claims against IDAE.

There was no premium paid at inception. The fair value of the purchased call option cannot be
reliably measured.

**38.2. Derivatives held for trading**

These are options on the shares or the assets of non-consolidated companies.

**38.2.1. Purchased call option agreement on the shares of SVL Pilote S`arl**

The current shareholder of SVL Pilote S`arl is:

— Private owner: . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 100%

If the option was exercised, Condat SAS would acquire up to 100% of the shares.

At 31 December 2014, the minimum exercise price of the option was EUR 1.5 M.

This price was considered as higher or equal to the fair value of the company. Therefore, nothing
was disclosed in the Statement of financial position.

**38.2.2. Purchased call option agreement on the tangible assets of P´erigord Energies SNC[´]**

The current shareholders of P´erigord Energies SNC are:[´]

– GDF SUEZ Energie Services SA: 99.8%

– SETHELEC SNC: 0.2%

There was a contract between P´erigord Energies SNC and Condat SAS for the supply of steam[´]
(see Note 35.4.1). Three months before the end of this 12-year contract, i.e. on 31 December 2012,
Condat SAS had to take the option to purchase 100% of the tangible assets of P´erigord Energies SNC[´]
or not. By means of a letter dated 21 December 2012, Condat SAS undertook to sign a new contract
for the supply of steam for an additional period up to 31 December 2016 but decided not to purchase
the tangible assets. The new contract was signed on 17 January 2014. It grants Condat SAS an option
to purchase 100% of the tangible assets for a total price of EUR 5 M as at 31 December 2016, or for
their Net Booked Value in case of early termination.

**38.3. Assignment of trade receivables**

From time to time, Lecta Group assigns trade receivables to financial institutions through
non-recourse agreements.

Such operations are accounted for in conformity with the accounting policy described in Note 1.37.

– Factoring: The corresponding advance is accounted for in the borrowings and disclosed in
Note 28.4. There was none as at 31 December 2014.

– Non-recourse invoice discounting and factoring: The residual commitment computed using the
continuous involvement methodology is accounted for in the borrowings and disclosed in
Note 28.4. The face value of these discounted invoices was EUR 37.5 M as at 31 December
2014.

– Non-recourse assignment: In such case, there is no residual commitment.

**NOTES — (Continued)**

**38.4. Derivatives on foreign currencies**

The Lecta Group operations are impacted by the fluctuations of the non-euro currencies, mainly
USD and GBP.

At 31 December 2014, ordinary sales and purchases were specifically hedged through:

— Forward agreements on realized sales in foreign currencies: . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . EUR 51.9 M
— Forward agreements on realized purchases in foreign currencies: . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . EUR 8.8 M

The impact of these contracts has been accounted for as fair value hedging, hence recognized in
the Income statement (see Note 1.36).

At 31 December 2014, there were no options on future sales in foreign currencies and on future
purchases in foreign currencies. Therefore, nothing had to be fair valued through Income statement.

Furthermore, in June 2007, Alto Garda Power SrL entered into a 13-year agreement with Italia
General Electric SpA, in order to execute the planned maintenance of the new cogeneration plant for
the period 2008 to 2020. As the payments of this agreement had to be made in USD, on 20 September
2007, Alto Garda Power SrL entered into several currency forward contracts for the purpose of hedging
part of its maintenance costs against any unexpected fluctuation of exchange rate of USD until
20 December 2014. The impact of these contracts has been accounted for as cash flow hedge. The
intrinsic value, considered as effective, was recognized directly in Equity while the time value was
considered as ineffective, and thus recognized in the Income statement (see Note 1.36).

**38.5. Hedging derivatives on interest rates**

_2012 Floating rate notes:_

On 28 June and 6 July 2012, the interest rate of 51% of the Floating rate notes issued in May
2012 (see Note 3.1) was hedged with Caps indexed to 3-month Euribor for the period from mid-August
2012 to mid-August 2014.

On 3 May 2013, the interest rate of 26% of the Floating rate notes was hedged with a Swap to
exchange 3-month Euribor variable rate against fixed rate of 0.385% for the period from mid-August
2013 to mid-February 2016.

On 24 April 2014, the interest rate of 26% of the Floating rate notes was hedged with a Cap
indexed to 3-month Euribor for the period from mid-August 2014 to mid-August 2016.

On 3 October 2014, the interest rate of 26% of the Floating rate notes was hedged with a Cap
indexed to 3-month Euribor for the period from mid-November 2014 to mid-August 2016.

_Alto Garda Power SrL:_

On 5 September 2007, the interests rates of 50% of the forecast debt in Alto Garda Power SrL
(see Note 28.4) were hedged with a Collar indexed to 6-month Euribor for the period from June 2007
to December 2018.

On 16 March 2010, the interests rates of 25% of the forecast debt were hedged with a Swap to
exchange 6-month Euribor variable rate against fixed rate of 2.995% for the period June 2010 to
December 2018.

In December 2012, Alto Garda Power SrL voluntarily repaid EUR 12 M of its debt. Following this
repayment, the notional amounts of the Collar and the Swap were higher than the debt. Consequently,
the Collar and part of the Swap were considered as hedging instruments, while the balance of the Swap
was no more considered as hedging instrument.

On 18 December 2013, the Swap to exchange 6-month Euribor variable rate was terminated.

Note 28.4) were hedged with a Swap to exchange 1-month Euribor variable rate against fixed rate of
2.14% for the period from June 2011 to March 2016.

The main characteristics of the above instruments are as follows.

The impact of these agreements has been accounted for as cash flow hedge, except for the balance
of the Swap in Alto Garda Power SrL that was accounted for as fair value hedge as at 31 December
2012.

For the cash flow hedge, the intrinsic value, considered as effective, was recognized directly in
Equity while the time value was considered as ineffective, and thus recognized in the Income statement.
For the fair value hedge, any gain or loss from re-measuring the hedging instrument at fair value is
recognized in the Income statement (see Note 1.36).

**38.6. Hedging derivatives on energy prices**

There was no hedging derivatives on energy price.

**38.7. Fair value of financial instruments**

Fair value hierarchy

Lecta Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial
instruments by valuation technique:

_Level 1:_ quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities

The fair value of 2012 notes was based on ex-coupon quotations. It should be considered with
caution as the High Yield Bonds market has low liquidity.

_Level 2:_ other techniques for which all inputs that have a significant effect on the recorded fair
value are observable, either directly or indirectly.

– For the hedging instruments, the inputs that have a significant effect on their fair value were
observable.

– For the other items, of which Trade receivables and Trade payables, no valuation techniques
had to be applied, as they were all short-term.

_Level 3:_ techniques that use inputs that have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that
are not based on observable market data.

It applies to Available-for-sale financial investments (see Note 19). The fair value consists in the
historical cost less eventual impairment.

To the Shareholders of
Lecta S.A.

L-2346 Luxembourg

**Report on the consolidated financial statements**

Following our appointment by the General Meeting of the Shareholders dated 25 April 2013, we
have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Lecta S.A., which comprise the
consolidated statement of financial position as at 31 December 2013, the consolidated income
statement, the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the consolidated statement of changes
in equity, the consolidated cash flow statement for the year then ended, and a summary of significant
accounting policies and other explanatory information.

_Board of Directors’ responsibility for the consolidated financial statements_

The Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these
consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as
adopted by the European Union and for such internal control as the Board of Directors determines is
necessary to enable the preparation and presentation of consolidated financial statements that are free
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

_Responsibility of the ‘‘r´eviseur d’entreprises agr´e´e’’_

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our
audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing as adopted for
Luxembourg by the ‘‘Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier’’. Those standards require that
we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether the consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement.

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and
disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the judgement
of the ‘‘r´eviseur d’entreprises agr´e´e’’, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of
the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments,
the ‘‘r´eviseur d’entreprises agr´e´e’’ considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair
presentation of the consolidated financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness
of the entity’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting
policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the Board of Directors, as well
as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a
basis for our audit opinion.

_Opinion_

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial
position of Lecta S.A. as of 31 December 2013, and of its financial performance and its cash flows for
the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the
European Union.

**NOTES**

**1.** **Summary of significant accounting policies**

**1.01. Basis of preparation**

The consolidated financial statements of Lecta Group have been prepared in accordance with the
Standards and Interpretations adopted by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and by
the E.U. applicable as at 1 January 2013. They comprise:

– International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS),

– International Accounting Standards (IAS),

– Interpretations originated by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee
(IFRIC) or the former Standing Interpretations Committee (SIC).

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on an historical cost basis, except for
the measurement at fair value of Available-for-sale financial assets, Biological assets and Derivative
financial instruments. The carrying values of recognized assets and liabilities that are hedged are
adjusted to record changes in the fair values attributable to the hedged risks.

In the process of applying Lecta Group’s accounting policies, the Management has made the
following judgments:

– Each consolidated company has the ability to continue as a going concern.

– Recognition of risks through provisions (see Note 31).

– Choice of an accounting treatment when alternative methods are allowed by existing
standards.

– Choice of an accounting treatment when insufficient guidance is provided by an existing
standard (see Notes 1.16 and 1.17).

Management of Lecta Group has also made assumptions for the years to come.

Where needed Management used assumptions (inflation, interest rates, exchange rates, prices,
volumes...) to develop strategies and prepare plans.

The assumptions and the resulting plans are used in preparing the financial statements
(e.g. computation of impairment tests, recognition of Deferred income tax assets...). Actual results may
differ from these estimates.

**1.02. Changes in accounting policies — New accounting standards**

The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year except as
follows:

Lecta Group adopted the following new and amended IAS, IFRS and IFRIC interpretations
during the year 2013. When their adoption is deemed to have an impact on the financial statements of
Lecta Group, such impact is described below.

– IAS 1 Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive Income — Amendments to IAS 1:

The amendments to IAS 1 change the grouping of items presented in other comprehensive income
(OCI). Items that can be reclassified (or ‘recycled’) to profit or loss at a future point in time are
presented separately from items that will never be reclassified.

The amendment affects presentation only and has no impact on the Group’s financial position or
performance.

– IAS 19 Employee Benefits (Revised)

The revised standard includes a number of amendments that range from fundamental changes to
simple clarifications and re-wording. The more significant changes include the following:

  - For defined benefit plans, the ability to defer recognition of actuarial gains and losses has
been removed. As revised, amounts recorded in profit or loss are limited to current and past
service costs, gains or losses on settlements, and net interest income . All other changes in the

F-224

**NOTES — (Continued)**

net defined benefit asset (liability), including actuarial gains and losses, are recognized in OCI
with no subsequent recycling to profit or loss.

  - Expected returns on plan assets are no longer recognized in profit or loss. Expected returns
are replaced by recording interest income in profit or loss, which is calculated using the
discount rate used to measure the pension obligation.

  - The new disclosures include quantitative information about the sensitivity of the defined
benefit obligation to a reasonably possible change in each significant actuarial assumption.

  - Termination benefits are recognized at the earlier of when the offer of termination cannot be
withdrawn, or when the related restructuring costs are recognized under IAS 37 Provisions,
Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets.

  - The distinction between short-term and other long-term employee benefits is based on the
expected timing of settlement rather than the employee’s entitlement to the benefits.

The amendment represents a significant further step in reporting gains and losses outside of profit
or loss, with no subsequent recycling. Actuarial gains and losses are excluded permanently from profit
or loss.

IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures (as revised in 2011)

As a consequence of the new IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements, and IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in
Other Entities, IAS 28 Investments in Associates, has been renamed IAS 28 Investments in Associates
and Joint Ventures, and describes the application of the equity method to investments in joint ventures
in addition to associates.

IFRS 7 Disclosures — Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities — Amendments to
IFRS 7

These amendments require an entity to disclose information about rights to set-off and related
arrangements. The disclosures would provide users with information that is useful in evaluating the
effect of netting arrangements on an entity’s financial position. The new disclosures are required for all
recognized financial instruments that are set off in accordance with IAS 32 Financial Instruments:
Presentation. The disclosures also apply to recognized financial instruments that are subject to an
enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement, irrespective of whether they are set off
in accordance with IAS 32.

IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements, IAS 27 Separate Financial Statements

IFRS 10 replaces the portion of IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements that
addresses the accounting for consolidated financial statements. It also addresses the issues raised in
SIC-12 Consolidation -Special Purpose Entities. IFRS 10 establishes a single control model that applies
to all entities including special purpose entities. The changes introduced by IFRS 10 requires
management to exercise significant judgment to determine which entities are controlled and therefore
are required to be consolidated by a parent, compared with the requirements that were in IAS 27.

IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements.

IFRS 11 replaces IAS 31 Interests in Joint Ventures and SIC-13 Jointly-controlled Entities —
Non-monetary Contributions by Venturers. Joint control under IFRS 11 is defined as the contractually
agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when the decisions about the relevant
activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. ‘Control’ in ‘joint control’ refers
to the definition of ‘control’ in IFRS 10.

IFRS 11 also changes the accounting for joint arrangements by moving from three categories
under IAS 31 to the following two categories:

  - Joint operation — an arrangement in which the parties with joint control have rights to the
assets and obligations for the liabilities relating to that arrangement. In respect of its interest
in a joint operation, a joint operator must recognize all of its assets, liabilities, revenues and
expenses, including its relative share of jointly controlled assets, liabilities, revenue and
expenses.

F-225


-----

**NOTES — (Continued)**

  - Joint venture — an arrangement in which the parties with joint control have rights to the net
assets of the arrangement. Joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method.

IFRS 12 Disclosure of Involvement with Other Entities

IFRS 12 applies to an entity that has an interest in subsidiaries, joint arrangements, associates
and/or structured entities. Many of the disclosure requirements of IFRS 12 were previously included in
IAS 27, IAS 31, and IAS 28, while others are new. The new disclosures will assist users to make their
own assessment of the financial impact of management’s conclusion regarding consolidation.

IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement

IFRS 13 establishes a single source of guidance under IFRS for all fair value measurements.
IFRS 13 does not change when an entity is required to use fair value, but rather provides guidance on
how to measure fair value under IFRS when fair value is required or permitted. IFRS 13 defines fair
value as an exit price. It is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to
transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The
fair value as used in IFRS 2 Share-based Payments and IAS 17 Leases is excluded from the scope of
IFRS 13.

Additional disclosures where required, are provided in the individual notes relating to the assets
and liabilities whose fair values were determined.

**1.03. Basis of consolidation**

The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the parent company
Lecta SA and its subsidiaries (including Special Purpose Entities) as at 31 December each year.

Subsidiaries are entities in which Lecta Group has the sole power to exercise control over their
operations.

All the consolidated subsidiaries are listed in Note 2.2.

Certain subsidiaries (including Special Purpose Entities) of Lecta Group are however not
consolidated on the basis of immateriality (see Note 2.3).

Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to Lecta Group and
cease to be consolidated from the date on which control is transferred out of Lecta Group.

All inter-company transactions, balances and unrealized gains and losses on transactions between
Lecta Group companies are eliminated on consolidation. Where local accounting policies followed by
subsidiaries differ significantly from those adopted for the purpose of the consolidated financial
statements, appropriate adjustments are made in order to achieve a consistent basis of accounting.

**1.04. Investment in associates**

An Associate is an entity, including an unincorporated entity such as a partnership, over which
Lecta Group has significant influence but which it does not control. It is neither a subsidiary nor a joint
venture.

An associate is accounted for under the equity method of consolidation. The investment in
associate is initially recognized at cost and adjusted thereafter for the post-acquisition changes in Lecta
Group’s share of net assets of the associate. Goodwill relating to the associate is included in the
carrying amount of the investment and is neither amortized nor individually tested for impairment.

The Income statement of Lecta Group includes Lecta Group’s share of the profit or loss after tax
of the associate.

After application of the equity method, Lecta Group determines whether it is necessary to
recognize an additional impairment loss on the Group’s investment in its associates. Lecta Group
determines at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that the investment in the
associate is impaired. If this is the case, Lecta Group calculates the amount of impairment as the
difference between the recoverable amount of the associate and its carrying value, and recognizes the
amount in the line ‘‘Share of results in associates’’ of the Income statement.

F-226


-----

**NOTES — (Continued)**

Lecta Group does not consolidate any associate.

**1.05. Interests in joint ventures**

A Joint venture is a contractual arrangement whereby Lecta Group and one or more third parties
undertake an economic activity that is subject to joint control.

A jointly controlled entity is accounted for under the equity method.

Refer to Note 1.04 for a description on the equity method.

Lecta Group does not have any joint venture, which requires consolidation.

**1.06. Glossary**

_EBITDA:_ Earnings before depreciation, amortization, non recurring items, finance costs, net
income from associates and income tax. It includes non-cash (expenses) incomes, consisting of
variations of inventories and operating provisions. This aggregate is a key performance indicator for
Lecta Group and the paper industry.

_Non-recurring items:_ Profits, losses or costs isolated for a better understanding of the business
performance. This heading comprises essentially:

– The profit and losses on disposals or impairments of Investment in associates (see Note 1.04),
Available-for-sale financial assets (see Note 1.18), and certain long-lived assets of which
Goodwill (see Note 1.21),

– The costs of restructuring and material reorganization,

– The acquisition costs in relation with business combinations, and the profit following the
immediate recognition of negative goodwill (see Note 1.14).

**1.07. Foreign currency transactions**

The presentation currency of Lecta Group is the euro (EUR).

For each entity of Lecta Group, transactions in foreign currencies are recorded in their functional
currency at the exchange rate prevailing at the transaction date. Monetary assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate prevailing at the year-end closing
date. Exchange differences are taken to the Income statement: Foreign exchange differences for
operating business items are recorded in the line ‘‘Other operating costs except non-recurring items ’’,
and financial items are recorded in the lines ‘‘Financial income’’ and ‘‘Financial expense’’.

An exception to the above would be the case of a foreign currency borrowing that would provide a
hedge against a net investment in a foreign entity. Lecta Group does not have such borrowing.

**1.08. Foreign currency translations — subsidiaries**

The Income statements of the non-euro consolidated subsidiaries are translated into euro at the
weighted average exchange rates for the year. Their assets and liabilities are translated into euro at the
exchange rate prevailing at the year-end closing date. The exchange differences are taken directly to
Equity. On disposal of the entity, the exchange differences accumulated are included in the line ‘‘Non
recurring items ’’ in the Income statement as a component of the gain or loss on disposal.

Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are stated in the
currency of the acquired entity at the date of the acquisition.

Lecta Group doesn’t have any entity within the group which operates in a hyper-inflationary
economy.

**NOTES — (Continued)**

**1.09. Revenue recognition**

Revenue is recognized to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to
Lecta Group and the revenue can be reliably measured. The following specific recognition criteria must
be met before revenue is recognized:

– Sales of goods: Revenue is recognized when goods leave the warehouses of the Group or
those of the consignees, or when, the goods being ready on the contractual date, their delivery
is postponed following the customer’s request. This method enables a reliable measurement of
revenue. It acknowledges that the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have
been transferred either to the buyer or to the transporter.

– Sales of energy: Revenue is recognized when the energy is effectively supplied to the buyer.

– Interest: Revenue is recognized as interest accrues.

– Dividends: Revenue is recognized when the shareholders’ right to receive the payment is
established.

**1.10. Property, plant and equipment**

Property, plant and equipment purchased by the Lecta Group’s companies are stated at historical
cost, increased where appropriate by terminal environmental reinstatement costs (none in Lecta
Group).

When acquired through a business combination, the assets are stated at their fair value at the date
of acquisition.

The Property, plant and equipment present in Lecta Group at First Time Adoption of IFRS as at
1 January 2004, were subject to specific rules: those of Cartiere del Garda SpA were fair valued and
these fair values were used as deemed cost at that date, while the values of property, plant &
equipment of all other companies used under the previous GAAP were maintained.

At closing date, Property, plant and equipment are stated at the above-mentioned gross value less
accumulated depreciation and any impairment.

Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the following estimated useful lives:

Land . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . No depreciation
Road, railways and car parks . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 20 to 40 years
Buildings . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 30 to 40 years

Furniture, fixtures and fittings . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5 to 10 years

**1.11. Maintenance**

Maintenance costs relating to an existing tangible asset are capitalized, if and only if it has a useful
life of more than one year and if it replaces an identifiable component of the existing tangible asset.
The cost represents a new component which will be depreciated individually. The depreciation will not
exceed the remaining useful life of the existing tangible asset except when it extends its useful life. This
capitalization also translates into derecognizing the replaced component.

For any given plant, the maintenance of existing Safety and Environment installations may be
necessary to continue to obtain the future economic benefits from the other assets of this plant
dedicated to production. Under such circumstances, they may qualify for recognition as Property, plant
and equipment. Should they not meet the above criteria, these costs are expensed.

F-228


-----

**NOTES — (Continued)**

Recurring maintenance or day-to-day servicing costs (outside contractors, felt & wires...) are always
expensed.

The overhauls of gas turbines of cogeneration plants are capitalized as Property, plant and
equipment and depreciated over 3 to 6 years.

**1.12. Leases**

Leases, which transfer to Lecta Group substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to
ownership of the leased item, are classified as finance leases.

Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset are
classified as operating leases.

_Finance leases are capitalized at the inception of the lease at the fair value of the leased property_
or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments. Lease payments are apportioned
between the finance charges and reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of
interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are included in the line ‘‘Finance
costs’’ of the Income statement. The lease liability is included in the line ‘‘Interest-bearing borrowings’’
of the Statement of financial position .

If there is a reasonable certainty that Lecta Group will obtain ownership by the end of the lease
term, the capitalized leases follow the same depreciation policy than the similar owned assets.
Otherwise, they are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease
term. In both cases, the depreciation is included in the line ‘‘Depreciation’’ of the Income statement.

_Operating lease payments are recognized as an expense in the line ‘‘Other operating costs except_
non recurring items’’ of the Income statement in accordance with the terms of the lease.

**1.13. Investment properties**

Investment properties consist of land or buildings, held to earn rentals or capital appreciation.

Investment properties purchased by Lecta Group’s companies are stated at historical cost,
increased where appropriate by terminal environmental reinstatement costs (none in Lecta Group).

When acquired by Lecta Group through a business combination, they are stated at their fair value
at the date of acquisition.

At closing date, investment properties are stated at the above-mentioned gross value less
accumulated depreciation and any impairment.

Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the following estimated useful lives:

Land . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . No depreciation
Buildings . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 30 to 40 years

Investment properties in Lecta Group consisted of plots of land in Amorebieta mill, closed in 2009
(see Note 16.2).

**1.14. Business combinations and goodwill**

_Business combinations from 1 January 2009 (prospective application)_

Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition
is measured as the aggregate of the consideration transferred, measured at acquisition date fair value
and the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree. For each business combination, the
acquirer measures the non controlling interest in the acquiree either at fair value or at the
proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. Acquisition costs incurred are expensed in
the line ‘‘Non-recurring items’’ (see Notes 1.06 and 11).

When the Group acquires a business, it assesses the financial assets and liabilities assumed for
appropriate classification and designation in accordance with the contractual terms, economic
circumstances and pertinent conditions as at the acquisition date.

F-229


-----

**NOTES — (Continued)**

If the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date fair value of the acquirer’s
previously held equity interest in the acquiree is remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date
through profit or loss. Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer is recognized at
fair value at the acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration
which is deemed to be an asset or liability, are recognized in accordance with IAS 39 either in profit or
loss or as a change to other comprehensive income. If the contingent consideration is classified as
equity, it is not remeasured until it is finally settled within equity.

Goodwill is initially measured at cost being the excess of the aggregate of the consideration
transferred and the amount recognized for non-controlling interest over the net identifiable assets
acquired and liabilities assumed. If this consideration is lower than the fair value of the net assets of
the subsidiary acquired, the difference (formerly known as negative goodwill) is recognized in profit or
loss in the line ‘‘Non recurring items’’ of the Income statement. After initial recognition, goodwill is
measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.

_Business combinations prior to 1 January 2009_

In comparison to the above-mentioned requirements, the following differences applied:

Business combinations were accounted for using the purchase method. Transaction costs directly
attributable to the acquisition formed part of the acquisition costs. The non-controlling interest (or non
controlling interest ) was measured at the proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets.
Business combinations achieved in stages were accounted for as separate steps. Any additional acquired
share of interest did not affect previously recognized goodwill. Contingent consideration was recognized
if, and only if, the Group had a present obligation, the economic outflow was more likely than not and
a reliable estimate was determinable. Subsequent adjustments to the contingent consideration were
recognized as part of goodwill.

**1.15. Other intangible assets**

Other intangible assets acquired separately are recognized at cost. Intangible assets acquired as
part of a business combination are recognized separately from Goodwill if the fair value can be
measured reliably on initial recognition, subject to the constraint that, unless the asset has a readily
ascertainable market value. The carrying values of intangible assets with definite useful lives are tested
for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be
recoverable. The carrying values of intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for
impairment on a yearly basis.

Research and Development costs are expensed when incurred, except for certain development
costs that are recognized when it is probable that the project will generate future economic benefits,
and the costs can be measured reliably.

Other internally generated intangible assets are not capitalized, but expensed against profit in the
year the costs were incurred.

Other intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis, over the shortest period between
their own legal duration and the useful life of the assets to which they benefit.

In Lecta Group, this heading comprises essentially:

**NOTES — (Continued)**

**1.16. CO2 emission rights**

In order to comply with the Kyoto protocol, the European Union has set up the CO2 (or
Greenhouse Gas) emission rights scheme.

Lecta Group elected to use the implicit rule of IAS 20 ‘‘Accounting for government grants and
disclosure of government assistance’’ to account for the CO2 emission rights. This rule is sometimes
referred to as ‘‘net liability method’’:

According to the ‘‘net liability method’’, the rights that have been granted free of charge by each
National Authority are not recognized. A provision at fair value is recognized for the tons of CO2
emitted in excess of the rights granted by each National Authority.

Purchased rights are initially recognized at cost in the line ‘‘Other intangible assets’’ of the
Statement of financial position .

After initial recognition, the purchased rights that are not in excess of the above-mentioned
provisioned tons are measured at fair value.

The rights in excess are kept at their historical cost, unless the market price drops below this cost.
In such a case, these rights are impaired.

All the movements in the Income statement are reported in the line ‘‘Other operating costs except
non recurring items’’.

These rules are implemented separately for each Subsidiary, because National Authorities grant
the rights to single companies.

**1.17. Green & White certificates**

On top of selling steam and electricity to Garda mill, excess electricity to the national grid, Alto
Garda Power SrL sells hot water to the local urban heating network. This gives Alto Garda Power SrL
title to the grant of Green certificates for a period of eight years starting in January 2010. No
obligation is attached to these Green certificates.

Lecta Group elected to use the implicit rule of IAS 20 ‘‘Accounting for government grants and
disclosure of government assistance’’ to account for the Green certificates. They are recognized as an
intangible asset, initially at nominal value, until they are sold to a third party. Following a change in
Italian regulation dated 6 July 2012, the Green certificates are recognized as a non-monetary
government grant, which corresponds to GSE (Gestore dei Servizi Energetici) guaranteed price (see
Note 4.6).

Thanks to its savings in the consumption of natural gas, Alto Garda Power SrL is entitled to a
grant of White certificates for a period of ten years starting in January 2012. No obligation is attached
to these White certificates.

Lecta Group elected to use the implicit rule of IAS 20 ‘‘Accounting for government grants and
disclosure of government assistance’’ to account for the White certificates. They are are recognized as a
non-monetary government grant, which corresponds to GSE (Gestore dei Servizi Energetici)
guaranteed price (see Note 3.9).

**1.18. Financial assets**

Financial assets are accounted for by considering the four categories defined by IAS 39, Financial
instruments recognition and measurement:

– Available-for-sale financial assets,

– Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss,

– Held-to-maturity investments,

– Loans and receivables,

F-231


-----

**NOTES — (Continued)**

Initially, all financial assets are recognized at their fair value, plus in the case of a Financial asset
not at fair value through profit or loss transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition or issue
of the said financial asset.

Then the accounting rules differ from one category to another:

_Available-for-sale financial assets are acquired to be held for an indefinite period of time but may_
be sold due to changed strategic decisions.

After initial recognition, they are measured at fair value.

Gains or losses are directly recognized in the line ‘‘Net incomes (expenses) recognized directly
through Equity’’ of the Statement of financial position, until the investment is sold, collected or
otherwise disposed of, or until the investment is determined to be impaired, at which time the
cumulative gain or loss previously reported in Equity is included in the line ‘‘Non recurring items ’’ of
the Income statement.

Call and put options on shares of non-consolidated companies (derivatives held for trading) are
accounted for at fair value in the lines ‘‘Other receivables’’ or ‘‘Other payables’’ of the Statement of
financial position . Changes in the fair value are entered in the line ‘‘Non recurring items ’’ of the
Income statement.

In Lecta Group, Available-for-sale investments are shares in companies that are not consolidated
on the basis of immateriality or because of the low ownership. They are reported in the line
‘‘Available-for-sale financial investments’’, in Non-current assets of the Statement of financial position .

_Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss include financial assets held for trading and_
financial assets designated upon initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss. Financial assets
are classified as held for trading if they are acquired for the purpose of selling or repurchasing in the
near term.

After initial recognition, they are measured at fair value.

Gains or losses are recognized in the lines ‘‘Financial income’’ and ‘‘Financial expense’’ of the
Income statement.

In Lecta Group, Investments at fair value through the profit or loss are money market funds used
to safely invest temporary excess cash. They are included in the line ‘‘Cash and cash equivalents’’, in
the Current assets of the Statement of financial position .

_Held-to-maturity investments are acquired with the intent to hold them to their fixed maturity_
(e.g. bonds).

Held-to-maturity investments are included in the line ‘‘Other non-current receivables’’, in the
Non-current assets of the Statement of financial position .

After initial recognition, they are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate
method. Amortized cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition,
over the period to maturity.

Gains and losses are recognized in the line ‘‘Finance costs’’ of the Income statement when the
investments are derecognized or impaired, as well as through the amortization process.

Lecta Group does not hold such investments.

_Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that_
are not quoted in an active market.

After initial recognition, they are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate
method. Amortized cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition,
over the period to maturity.

Gains and losses are recognized in the line ‘‘Non recurring items ’’ of the Income statement when
the investments are derecognized or impaired, as well as through the amortization process.

F-232


-----

**NOTES — (Continued)**

This category comprises for Lecta Group:

– the Trade receivables (see Note 1.23);

– the financial investments originated by the group included in the line ‘‘Other non-current
assets’’ in the Non-current assets of the Statement of financial position (see Notes 1.25 and
1.34):

– deposits,

– guarantees,

– loans to non-consolidated companies or third parties.

_Date of recognition_

All sales and purchases of financial assets are recognized using the settlement date, i.e. the date
the asset is delivered to or received from the counterpart.

Included in this category are all sales or purchases of financial assets that require delivery of assets
within the timeframe generally established by regulation or convention in the market place.

_Derecognition_

See Note 1.37.

**1.19. Biological assets**

In Lecta Group, biological assets are limited to standing timber. The latter is exclusively dedicated
to internal consumption for the production of pulp.

They are reported in the line ‘‘Biological assets’’, under Non-current assets of the Statement of
financial position . They are measured at fair value.

**1.20. Non-current assets held for sale**

A non-current asset is held for sale if its carrying amount will be recovered principally through a
sale transaction rather than through continuing use. For this to be the case, the asset must be available
for immediate sale in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sales
of such assets and its sale must be highly probable.

The non-current assets classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying
amount and their fair value less costs to sell. They are not depreciated any more. They are presented
separately from the other assets in the Statement of financial position .

**1.21. Impairment of certain long-lived assets**

Property, plant and equipment, Investment properties and Other intangible assets are reviewed for
impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be
recoverable. This review is done each year for the Goodwill and other indefinite life intangible assets.
Where the carrying values exceed the estimated recoverable amount, the asset or the associated
cash-generating unit is written down to its recoverable amount.

The recoverable amount is the greater of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing
value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax
discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific
to the asset. For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable
amount is determined for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.

Impairment losses are recognized in the line ‘‘Non recurring items ’’ in the Income statement.

**1.22. Inventories**

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost includes materials, direct
labor and an attributable proportion of manufacturing overheads based on normal levels of activity.

F-233


-----

**NOTES — (Continued)**

Cost is computed according to the weighted average cost method. Net realizable value is based on
estimated selling price, less further costs expected to be incurred to completion and disposal.

Given the lack of meaningful market references, the inventoried spare parts are impaired in
accordance with slow moving rules reflecting their obsolescence.

**1.23. Trade receivables**

Trade receivables are recognized and carried at original invoice amount less an allowance for
uncollectable amounts.

An estimate for doubtful debts is made when collection of part or all of a receivable is no longer
probable. Bad debts are written off when identified.

**1.24. Prepayments**

This heading comprises payments to trade or other payables for future benefits such as insurance
premiums, maintenance expenses and rents. Prepayments are stated at their nominal value.

**1.25. Other receivables**

This heading comprises:

– Loans,

– Deposits and guarantees,

– Grants receivables,

– Capital receivables on the sale of long-lived assets,

– Shareholders receivables (e.g. on capital increase),

– Dividends receivables,

– Favorable options on non-consolidated companies,

– Favorable currency hedging,

– Favorable interest rate hedging,

– Favorable energy price hedging,

– Miscellaneous other receivables (e.g. expected reimbursement through an insurance contract).

**1.26. Cash and cash equivalents**

This heading comprises:

– Cash in hand,

– Cash in banks’ current accounts,

– Short-term deposits and certificates of deposit with an original maturity of three months or
less,

– Marketable securities (Government bonds, Treasury bills and similar short-term securities).

Any gains and losses on Cash and cash equivalents are recognized in the Income statement, under
the lines ‘‘Financial income’’ and ‘‘Financial expense’’.

Note: In the Cash flow statement, the analysis is focused on variation of Cash and cash equivalents
_net of Bank overdrafts._

**1.27. Interest-bearing borrowings and Bank overdrafts**

Initially, all financial liabilities are recognized at their fair value, plus in the case of a Financial
liability not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the
acquisition or issue of the financial liability.

F-234


-----

**NOTES — (Continued)**

After initial recognition, they are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate
method. Amortized cost is calculated by taking into account any issue costs and any discount or
premium on settlement.

Gains and losses are recognized in the lines ‘‘Financial income’’ and ‘‘Financial expense’’ of the
Income statement, when the liabilities are derecognized or impaired, as well as through the
amortization process.

Lecta Group applies IAS 23 (revised) — Borrowing Costs as of 1 January 2009. Since the related
criteria were not met in 2009 and 2010, Lecta Group did not recognize any borrowing cost in the
long-lived assets until 31 December 2010. In 2011, some borrowing cost in the long-lived assets were
capitalized (see Note 12).

_Financial liabilities at fair value through the profit or loss include financial liabilities held for trading_
and financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition as at fair value through profit or loss.

Financial liabilities are classified as held for trading if they are acquired for the purpose of selling
in the near term. Derivatives, including separated embedded derivatives are also classified as held for
trading unless they are designated as effective hedging instruments.

After initial recognition, they are measured at fair value.

Gains or losses are recognized in the lines ‘‘Financial income’’ and ‘‘Financial expense’’ of the
Income statement.

In Lecta Group, no financial liabilities were designated as at fair value through profit or loss.

**1.28. Grants**

Grants constitute deferred income related to Property, plant and equipment, or Borrowings with
off-market interest rates. Grants are recognized at their fair value. They are released on a straight-line
basis in the line ‘‘Depreciation’’ of the Income statement, over the expected useful life of the relevant
asset.

**1.29. Provisions**

Provisions are recognized when:

– Lecta Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event; and

– It is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to
settle the obligation; and

– A reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made.

Where Lecta Group expects the impact of a provision to be neutralized, for example under an
insurance contract, a separate asset is recognized when it is virtually certain.

If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the
expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value
of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.

Where discounting is used, the change of the provision due to the time value of money is
recognized in the lines ‘‘Financial income’’ or ‘‘Financial expense’’ in the Income statement.

**1.30. Employee benefits**

Lecta Group’s employees take advantage of various benefits schemes:

– Short-term employee benefits:

These include wages, salaries, paid holidays, social contributions, sick leave, compensated
absences, bonuses, profit sharing and non-monetary benefits, all paid within 12 months after
service is rendered.

F-235


-----

**NOTES — (Continued)**

– Defined contribution post-employment plans:

The cost to the employer is fixed and predictable.

The charge for the period is the contribution due in respect of the service rendered during the
period. Payments in advance are reported in the line ‘‘Prepayments’’ of the Statement of
financial position . Payments in arrears are reported in the line ‘‘Trade payables’’ of the
Statement of financial position . Any accrual that does not fall due within 12 months beyond
Statement of financial position date is discounted and recognized at its present value.

– Defined benefit post-employment plans:

The employer retains a risk of additional contributions to be paid. The plan is valued in the
Statement of financial position at the present value of the obligation less the fair value of any
plan assets legally separate from the employer. Any unrecognized past service costs, is
immediately recognized. All actuarial gains or losses are immediately recognized. For any
curtailment or settlement, the resulting change is immediately recognized.

– Other long-term benefits:

These include long-service or jubilee benefits. All actuarial gains or losses and any past service
costs are immediately recognized.

– Termination benefits:

These include early retirement schemes or redundancy programs. They are recognized as a
liability and an expense when and only when a company of Lecta Group is demonstrably
committed to terminate the employment of a group of employees before the normal
retirement date or provide termination benefits as a result of an offer made to encourage
voluntary redundancy.

Lecta Group employees do not benefit from Equity compensation benefits plan or share based
payments plan.

The employee benefits may be funded, resulting in a debt obligation with financial institutions, or
unfunded, resulting in the booking of a provision. Independent qualified actuaries review any material
long-term obligation of Lecta Group.

The costs are accounted for as follows:

– The actuarial gains and losses of Defined benefit post-employment plans are directly
recognized in the lines ‘‘Net incomes (expenses) recognized directly through Equity’’ and
‘‘Deferred tax’’ of the Statement of financial position .

– All the other costs are recognized in the Income statement, in the following lines:

– Costs related to active employees: ‘‘Labor costs’’.

– Costs related to retired people: ‘‘Other operating costs except non recurring items ’’.

– Costs due to the time value of money: ‘‘Financial expense’’.

**1.31. Income tax payable**

Income tax payable includes withholding tax.

**1.32. Deferred tax**

Deferred tax is provided, using the liability method, on all temporary differences at the Statement
of financial position date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for
financial reporting purposes.

Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for all taxable temporary differences (e.g. accelerated tax
depreciation, deductible legal revaluation), except (i) where the deferred tax liability arises from the
initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business

F-236


-----

**NOTES — (Continued)**

combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit
or loss, or (ii) in respect of taxable temporary differences that will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Deferred tax _assets are recognized for all deductible temporary differences (e.g. employee benefits_
paid to financial institutions for which the deductibility is deferred), carry forward of unused tax credits
and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available to use these
assets. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to
the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part
of the deferred tax asset to be utilized. Unrecognized deferred tax assets are reassessed at each
reporting date and are recognized to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profits
will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the
period when the asset is realized or the liability settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have
been enacted or substantively enacted at the Statement of financial position date.

Deferred tax relating to items recognized outside the Income statement is also recognized outside
the Income statement, i.e. in the Statement of comprehensive income or directly in Equity in the
Statement of financial position .

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset, if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current
tax assets against current income tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity
and the same taxation authority.

**1.33. Trade payables**

This heading comprises:

– Trade payables,

– Employees and social charges,

– VAT and other taxes except Income tax and withholding tax,

– Any accruals on the above.

**1.34. Other payables**

This heading comprises:

– Capital payables following the purchase of long-lived assets,

– Shareholders payables (e.g. on capital redemption),

– Dividends payables,

– Options on Minorities of consolidated companies (see Note 1.35),

– Unfavorable options on non-consolidated companies,

– Unfavorable currency hedging,

– Unfavorable interest rate hedging,

– Unfavorable energy price hedging,

– Miscellaneous other payables (non recurring items ).

**1.35. Options on Minorities of consolidated companies**

Options on Minorities of consolidated companies are Equity derivatives:

A premium paid or received on equity derivatives at inception is recorded in Equity in a specific
line ‘‘Equity derivatives’’. Up to now, Lecta Group did not pay such premiums.

The discounted value of the exercise price of a sold option or a firm commitment, at inception and
at each year-end, is recorded in the line ‘‘Other payables’’ against the line ‘‘Non controlling interests’’.

F-237


-----

**NOTES — (Continued)**

Since 1 January 2009 and in accordance with IAS27 (revised), when a sold option or a firm
commitment on minorities is exercised, the amount in Other payables is reversed against Cash, and the
remaining balances of non controlling interest s and Equity derivatives are reversed against Equity.

**1.36. Derivative hedging instruments**

Lecta Group uses derivative instruments to hedge foreign currency, interest rate and energy price
fluctuations. Such derivative instruments are stated at their fair values as communicated by the financial
institutions and the energy companies that are the counterparties to these transactions.

For accounting purposes, derivative instruments are classified in the three following categories:

– _Fair value hedges: to cover the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or_
liability. In Lecta Group, these are forward agreements on realized day-to-day sales and
purchases in non-euro currencies. Any gain or loss from re-measuring the hedging instrument
at fair value is recognized in the line ‘‘Other operating costs except non recurring items ’’ of
the Income statement against ‘‘Trade receivables’’ or ‘‘Trade payables’’.

– _Cash flow hedges: to cover the exposure to variability in cash flows that is attributable to a_
particular risk associated with a forecast transaction. In Lecta Group, these could be the
interest rate, exchange rate and energy price swaps, caps, floors, collars, options. The portion
of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is
recognized directly in the line ‘‘Net incomes (expenses) recognized directly through Equity’’ of
the Statement of financial position against ‘‘Other receivables’’ or ‘‘Other payables’’. It is
removed from Equity when the hedged item affects the Income statement. The ineffective
portion of gain or loss is immediately recognized in the line ‘‘Non recurring items ’’ of the
Income statement.

– _Hedges of net investments in foreign entities denominated in a non-euro currency: In Lecta_
Group, there is no such instrument. The accounting treatment is the same as for Cash flow
hedges.

**1.37. Derecognition of financial assets and liabilities**

_Financial assets_

A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of group of similar
financial assets) is derecognized when:

a) The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired; or

b) The Group retains the right to receive cash flows from the asset, but has assumed an obligation to
pay them in full without material delay to a third party under a pass through arrangement; or

c) The Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset and either (i) has
transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or (ii) has neither transferred nor
retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.

Where the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from an asset and has neither
transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset nor transferred control of
the asset, the asset is recognized to the extent of the Group’s continuing involvement in the asset.
Continuing involvement that takes the form of a guarantee over the transferred asset is measured at
the lower of the original carrying amount of the asset and the maximum amount of consideration that
the Group could be required to repay.

Where continuing involvement takes the form of a written and / or purchased option (including a
cash settled option or similar provision) on the transferred asset, the extent of the Group’s continuing
involvement is the amount of the transferred asset that the Group may repurchase, except that in the
case of a written put option (including a cash settled option or similar provision) on an asset measured
at fair value, the extent of the Group’s continuing involvement is limited to the lower of the fair value
of the transferred asset and the option exercise price.

**NOTES — (Continued)**

_Financial liabilities_

A financial liability is derecognized when the obligation under the liability is discharged or
cancelled or expired.

**1.38. Future changes in accounting policies**

New amended IAS interpretations not yet effective:

– Amendments to IAS 32 — Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities

These amendments clarify the meaning of ‘‘currently has a legally enforceable right to set-off’’
and the criteria for non-simultaneous settlement mechanisms of clearing houses to qualify for
offsetting. These are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014. These
amendments are not expected to be relevant to the Group.

– Amendments to IAS 36 — Recoverable amount disclosure for non financial assets

The amendments clarify the disclosure requirements in respect of fair value less costs of
disposal. When IAS 36 Impairment of Assets was originally changed as a consequence of
IFRS 13, the IASB intended to require disclosure of information about the recoverable
amount of impaired assets if that amount was based on fair value less costs to sell. An
unintended consequence of the amendments was that an entity would be required to disclose
the recoverable amount for each cash-generating unit for which the carrying amount of
goodwill or intangible assets with indefinite useful lives allocated to that unit was significant in
comparison with the entity’s total carrying amount of goodwill or intangible assets with
indefinite useful lives. This requirement has been deleted by the amendment. These are
effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014.

– Amendments to IAS 39 — Novation of Derivatives and Continuation of Hedge accounting

These amendments provide relief from discontinuing hedge accounting when novation of a
derivative designated as a hedging instrument meets certain criteria. These amendments are
effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014.

Lecta Group is evaluating the effects of the above standards applicable as from 1 January 2014
and expects that their adoption will have no impact on the financial statements.

On 11 May 2012, Lecta Group successfully refinanced its debt through the issue of EUR 590 M
new notes (‘‘2012 notes’’):

– EUR 390 M of Floating rate senior secured notes due 2018, bearing an interest rate of
3-month Euribor + 5.5%,

– EUR 200 M of Fixed rate senior secured notes due 2019, bearing an interest rate of 8.875%,

The 2012 notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and traded on
the Euro MTF market.

The 2012 notes documentation contains certain covenants but no financial ratios have to be met
on a quarterly basis.

In addition, Lecta negotiated a new EUR 80 M committed Revolving Credit Facility due 2018.

The net proceeds from the issuance of these 2012 notes, combined with cash on Statement of
financial position, have been used to refinance the existing EUR 717.7 M senior secured and unsecured
Floating Rate Notes (‘‘2007 notes’’) due 2014, and to pay fees and costs related to the transaction.

The difference between the carrying amount of the 2007 notes (EUR 712.8 M) extinguished and
the consideration paid (EUR 717.7 M), was charged as a Financial expense in the income statement.
This difference of EUR 4.9 M consisted in the balance of the former 2007 notes issue costs not yet
amortized.

The transaction cost in relation with the issuance of the 2012 notes of EUR 24.8 M, were
capitalized as Issue costs and are amortized as Financial expense until the maturity of the 2012 notes.

**3.2. Projects and plans**

Lecta has Board authorization to explore projects aimed at (i) the simplification of the Group
structure from a corporate and tax standpoint, (ii) the optimization of the operating organization,
(iii) the strengthening of its specialty papers and merchanting operations, and (iv) the identification of
exit opportunities.

**3.3. Renewal of the Board authorization to increase the share capital**

The Extraordinary general meeting of 25 April 2013 renewed the authorization granted to the
Board of Directors to increase, for an additional period of five years the subscribed share capital of
Lecta within the limits of the authorized capital of the company.

On 31 December 2013, the subscribed Share capital was composed of 560,366 shares with a par
value of EUR 2.58 representing EUR 1,446 K, all shares being fully paid.

The Board of Directors is authorized, during a period of five years ending on 24 April 2018, to
increase once or several times the subscribed Share capital within the limits of the authorized Share
capital up to an amount of EUR 1,665 K, i.e. by the issuance of up to 85,082 new shares all with a par
value of EUR 2.58, representing EUR 220 K.

The Board of Directors is authorized, within the authorized Share capital, to issue and sell 90,399
warrants entitling the holders to subscribe for up to 90,399 new shares. At 31 December 2013, 90,378
warrants had been issued and sold, of which 69,878 had expired and 8,004 had been exercised. The
remaining 12,496 warrants had different rights of conversion, subject to conditions precedent, entitling
holders to subscribe up to 7,246 shares.

**3.4. Swap on interest rates**

On 3 May 2013, the interest rate of 26% of the Floating rate notes issued in May 2012 was hedged

**3.5. Organization efficiency program**

The integration process covers Lecta industrial operations in Italy, France and Spain, as well as the
paper merchanting ones in the same countries and Portugal.

Within the Organization efficiency program, Lecta planned several cost reduction initiatives. The
program aims at EUR 38 M fixed costs savings per year of which EUR 15 M were obtained in 2013.
The estimate of restructuring cash cost is EUR (41) M.

For the year 2013, the total restructuring cost associated to Lecta efficiency program was
EUR (16.9) M, reported in the line ‘‘Non recurring items’’ (see Note 11). After payments, as at
31 December 2013, the remaining provision for restructuring was EUR 10.6 M (see Note 31).

**3.5.1. Condat’s restructuring (France)**

The Management of Condat SAS presented on 22 March 2013 to its Works Council a
comprehensive restructuring plan aiming the permanent closure of the production line n�6 (with a
production capacity of 130,000 tons of CWF). The negotiations were successfully completed in June
2013 and the implementation of the restructuring plan started with the permanent closure of the
production line n�6 on 1 July 2013. The restructuring plan entails a job position reduction of 139.

An impairment of the Line 6 tangible assets of EUR (12.0) M was recorded in December 2012 in
the line ‘‘Non-recurring items’’. It was complemented by an impairment of the Line 6 spare parts of
EUR (0.7) M in June 2013. The transfer of Line 6 standard components to the stock of spare parts
and an adjustment of the initial impairment partly offset the impairment charge by EUR 5.3 M in
December 2013. The total net impairment charge amounts to EUR (7.4) M (see Note 11).

A provision for restructuring of EUR (11.0) M was also booked in the line ‘‘Non recurring items’’
in March 2013 (see Note 11).

**3.5.2. Torraspapel and Sarriopapel y Celulosa’s restructuring (Spain)**

In the context of the reallocation of its production capacities, in 2013 Lecta decided to install a
second-hand Paper Machine n�7 in its Zaragoza mill. PM7 will produce base paper to be converted into
specialty papers by Leitza plant. The investment aims at maximizing the use of pulp produced on the
site, thus reducing drying and transportation costs of pulp to other mills.

This decision led to the permanent closure of Berrobi / Uranga mill (with a production capacity of
27,000 tons of base paper) at the end of January 2014.

An Impairment of Berrobi / Uranga tangible assets of EUR (4.7) M was recorded in June 2013,
complemented by EUR (0.5) M in December 2013. The total impairment charge of EUR (5.2) M was
reported in the line ‘‘Non-recurring items’’ (see Notes 11 and 40).

Probably, this decision will result in the need to reconsider the role of Sarri`a de Ter paper mill
(with a production capacity of 65,000 tons of base paper and UWF) and Cogeneraci´on del Ter
cogeneration plant (with a power of 25MW). An impairment of their tangible assets and spare parts of
EUR (24.7) M was reported in the line ‘‘Non-recurring items’’ in December 2013 (see Notes 11 and
40).

**3.5.3. Torraspapel Malmenayde’s restructuring (France)**

The Management of Torraspapel Malmenayde S`arl presented on 28 June 2013 to its Works
Council a comprehensive restructuring plan aiming the outsourcing of Torraspapel Malmenayde
transportation activity. The negotiations were successfully completed in October 2013 and the

**NOTES — (Continued)**

implementation of the restructuring started in November 2013. The restructuring plan entails a job
position reduction of 17.

A provision for restructuring of EUR (0.8) M was reported in the line ‘‘Non-recurring items’’ in
June 2013 (see Note 11).

**3.5.4. Polyedra’s restructuring (Italy)**

The Management of Polyedra presented on 20 June 2013 to its Trade Unions a comprehensive
restructuring plan aiming the centralization of the management and administration activities in Milano,
the adaptation of the structure to the reduced size of the Italian market, and some reorganization in
the logistic services with the closure of 3 warehouses in 2013.

The plan provides for the voluntary redundancy of a maximum of 58 employees until
15 September 2014 (see Note 36.7).

In June 2013, a provision for restructuring of EUR (3.0) M and an impairment in tangible asset of
EUR (0.15) M were reported in the line ‘‘Non-recurring items’’ (see Note 11).

An unused provision of EUR 0.4 M in relation with a restructuring initiated prior to Polyedra’s
acquisition was released in September 2013 in the line ‘‘Non-recurring items’’ (see Note 11).

**3.5.5. Other cost reduction initiatives**

Other cost reduction initiatives include:

– Agreement with Cartiere del Garda employees to reduce labor cost through the conversion of
part of fixed into variable salary linked to the performance of the company (February 2013);

– Reorganization of the Paper merchanting structure with headcount reductions of �8 FTE in
Portugal (November-December 2012), �22 FTE in Spain (March 2013), and �107 FTE in
Italy (until March 2013);

– Bonus scheme indexed to EBITDA performance (March 2013);

– Denunciation of Progil pension regime to active employees in Condat (June 2013); this
denunciation led to a one-off reduction of the provision for defined benefit post- employment
plans of EUR 8.0 M reported in the line ‘‘Labor costs’’ in September 2013;

– Curtailment of the provision for Retirement plan IFC following the implementation of the
restructuring in Condat (see Note 3.5.1); the one-off reduction of the provision for defined
benefit post- employment plans of EUR 1.5 M was reported in the line ‘‘Labor costs’’ in
September 2013;

– Denunciation of labor side agreements in Condat (December 2013) related to the working
time and the structure of the remuneration. Condat’s management plans to negotiate with the
unions a new set of labor side agreements designed to promote the company performance,
and the individual and collective efforts. The denounced side agreements will cease to have
effect on 1 March 2015.

– Cancellation of pension fund schemes in Spain (May 2013);

– Cancellation of mill special agreements in Spain (July 2013).

**3.6. Draft decree applicable to Spanish cogeneration plants**

The current draft decree applies to the Spanish cogeneration plants selling electricity to the grid.
Lecta considered two consequences in its accounts as at 31 December 2013:

**3.6.1. Provisional reduction in Revenue of energy**

The current draft decree applies retroactively as of 14 July 2013. Lecta considered a provisional
reduction in ‘‘Sales of energy’’ of EUR (4.4) M for the 5.5-month period ending on 31 December 2013
(see Note 8).

that Lecta decided to impair its intangible and tangible assets, as well as its stock of spare parts. An
impairment charge of EUR (5.1) M was recorded in December 2013 (see Note 11).

**3.7. Non-recognition of some deferred tax assets**

The uncertainties in short-term future profitability, led to the non-recognition of some deferred tax
assets (see Notes 13 and 32.3). In 2013, the impact was EUR (9.8) M in Condat Holding tax group
(France), and EUR (12.9) M in Lecta HQ tax group (Spain).

merged into Polyedra SpA on 1 January 2013.

**3.8.2. Sale of Argentinean paper distributor Torraspapel Argentina SA**

political and regulatory uncertainties, obstacles to the repatriation of profits, growing difficulties to
obtain import licenses, and risk of devaluation of the local currency (ARS).

Following the decision to exit from the office supplies business unit of Polyedra group, this activity
was isolated in the Consolidated income statement line ‘‘Profit (loss) after tax from discontinued
operations’’ as of 1 July 2012. Its impact was EUR (167) K as at 31 December 2012.

**4.5.3. Acquisition of non controlling interests in Nord Papier SA**

On 23 July 2012, the minority shareholders in Nord Papier SA agreed to sell their 34%
participation to Condat Holding SAS against a payment of EUR 1.9 M.

The transfer of ownership to Condat Holding SAS was done on 25 September 2012. With this
acquisition, Nord Papier SA is fully owned by Lecta. As of 1 January 2013, Nord Papier SA joined the
French tax group led by Condat Holding SAS.

**4.6. Green certificates**

On top of selling steam and electricity to Garda mill, excess electricity to the national grid, Alto
Garda Power SrL sells hot water to the local urban heating network. This gives Alto Garda Power SrL
title to the grant of Green certificates for a period of eight years starting in January 2010. No
obligation is attached to these Green certificates.

This change in estimate generated a profit of EUR 2.5 M reported in the line ‘‘Other operating
costs except non-recurring items’’ in 2012.

(1) Impact of local rates:

– The local tax rates (actual and deferred) were generally higher than the Luxembourg actual
nominal tax rate. Applied to the sum of locally computed profit (loss) before tax, negative in
2013, the difference in tax rates generated a favorable impact of EUR 1,745 K;

– The change in tax rates from 2012 to 2013 had an impact of EUR 310 K.

(2) Adjustments on usable tax losses:

– Some deferred tax assets on tax losses were impaired for a total of EUR (21,900) K (see
Notes 3.7 and 13.1);

– There were some adjustments on tax losses for a total of EUR (3,086) K.

(3) Permanent differences on tax bases:

– Non-deductible depreciations costs for a total of EUR (1,407) K;

– Non-deductible impairment of some assets for a total of EUR (2,439) K;

– Thin capitalization rules on Financial expense generated an unfavorable impact of
EUR (10,111) K;

– Other definitively non-taxable profits resulted in a favorable impact of EUR 359 K.

(4) Other adjustments:

– The IRAP (‘‘Imposta Regionale sulle Attivita Produttive’’) was computed on a larger base
than the taxable earnings in Italy, leading to an favorable impact of EUR 3,034 K (see
Note 32.3);

– The CVAE (‘‘Cotisation sur la Valeur Ajout´ee des Entreprises’’) was computed on a larger
base than the taxable earnings in France, leading to an unfavorable impact of EUR (353) K
(see Note 32.3);

– The transfer of assets within Lecta group generated a taxable capital gain, eliminated in the
consolidation, while the use of tax losses was not. This led to an unfavorable adjustment of
EUR (8,230) K;

– The sale of Torraspapel Argentina SA (see Note 3.8.2) led to the recognition of
EUR (3,802) K unrealized Foreign currency translation. This led to an unfavorable impact of

**NOTES — (Continued)**

‘‘Diluted earnings per share’’ took into account share equivalents having a dilutive effect after
deduction of the weighted average number of share equivalents owned by Lecta Group consolidated
companies. The dilutive effect of warrants was calculated using the notional investment method for
which the Net earnings were adjusted to include a notional after tax interest income on proceeds
coming from the sale of warrants.

Nota: IAS 33 paragraph 43 requires that the diluted earnings per share does not assume
conversion, exercise or other issue of potential ordinary shares that would have an anti-dilutive effect
on earnings per share.

considers one cash-generating unit. Consequently, goodwill was tested for impairment at Group level
only.

This is consistent with the Note 5 prepared in accordance with IFRS 8 ‘‘Operating Segments’’.

The recoverable amount of this cash-generating unit has been determined based on value-in-use
calculation (see Note 1.21). This was produced based upon 2014 to 2017 cash-flow projections part of
Lecta financial plan, as approved by Lecta Group Management.

As mentioned in Note 1.01, Lecta Group Management made assumptions for the years to come.
Conservative assumptions on the annual growth rate were applied to the cash flow projections beyond
2017. The WACC rate applied to cash flow projections was 9.2%.

On 31 December 2012, the impairment test led to the recognition of an impairment of EUR (65.2) M
(see Notes 4.2 and 11).

A sensitivity analysis showed that:

– An increase of 100 bps of the WACC rate applied to cash flow projections, from 9.2% to
10.2%, everything else being equal, had an unfavorable impact of EUR 84 M.

– A decrease of 10% of the EBITDA applied to the period 2013 to 2016 and beyond 2016,
everything else being equal, had an unfavorable impact of EUR 81 M.

On 31 December 2013, the impairment test was successfully passed and no impairment was
recognized.

A sensitivity analysis showed that:

– An increase of 100 bps of the WACC rate applied to cash flow projections, from 9.2% to
10.2%, everything else being equal, has an unfavorable impact of EUR 72 M.

– A decrease of 10% of the EBITDA applied to the period 2014 to 2017 and beyond 2017,
everything else being equal, has an unfavorable impact of EUR 49 M.

consists in IRES, ‘‘Robin’’ tax and IRAP. IRES rate is 27.5%. ‘‘Robin’’ tax applies to AGP only. Its rate depends on the
year and varies from 0% to 10.5%. It was 10.5% in 2012 and 2013. Normal IRAP rate is 3.44%. In the region of Trentino

introduced in 2007, the TFR is no longer a defined benefit plan but has become a defined
contribution plan. Nevertheless, the TFR contribution amounts accrued until 31 December
2006 continues to be managed by the Company and thus the related liability continues to be
recorded in the financial statements as a long-term liability that has to be accounted for at its
present value (subject to actuarial evaluation). The present value of the employee termination
indemnity liability has been computed by an independent actuary considering the abovementioned change in law. The effect as at 1 January 2007, deriving from the change in law,

**NOTES — (Continued)**

**38.1.1. Sold put and Purchased call option on the shares of IDAE Sant Joan AIE**

IDAE Sant Joan AIE owns the cogeneration plant located in Sant Joan. Torraspapel SA (51%)
and IDAE (49%) currently hold IDAE Sant Joan AIE. According to the partnership agreement signed
in December 2007 between Torraspapel SA and IDAE (Spanish Public Entity), IDAE shall remain as a
partner in IDAE Sant Joan AIE until it recovers its investment plus a remuneration of 3-month
Euribor + 4%.

Once the first five years as of start-off of the cogeneration plant (August 2011) have elapsed,
Torraspapel SA may also request the assignment of IDAE’s share participation in IDAE Sant Joan
AIE. For that purpose, Torraspapel SA would have to pay IDAE an amount equal to its investment
plus the referred remuneration once deducted any amounts already reimbursed to IDAE by any means.

In both cases, assignment is only possible if:

– All loans granted to of IDAE Sant Joan AIE by any third parties have been previously repaid

– Or the relevant creditors specifically waive all claims against IDAE.

There was no premium paid at inception. The fair value of the purchased call option cannot be
reliably measured.

**38.2. Derivatives held for trading**

These are options on the shares or the assets of non-consolidated companies.

**38.2.1. Purchased call option agreement on the shares of SVL Pilote S`arl**

The current shareholder of SVL Pilote S`arl is:

– Private owner: . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 100%

If the option was exercised, Condat SAS would acquire up to 100% of the shares.

At 31 December 2013, the minimum exercise price of the option was EUR 1.5 M.

This price was considered as higher or equal to the fair value of the company. Therefore, nothing
was disclosed in the Statement of financial position .

**38.2.2. Purchased call option agreement on the tangible assets of P´erigord Energies SNC[´]**

The current shareholders of P´erigord Energies SNC are:[´]

– GDF SUEZ Energie Services SA: 99.8%

– SETHELEC SNC: 0.2%

There was a contract between P´erigord Energies SNC and Condat SAS for the supply of steam[´]
(see Note 35.4.1). Three months before the end of this 12-year contract, i.e. on 31 December 2012,
Condat SAS had to take the option to purchase 100% of the tangible assets of P´erigord Energies SNC[´]
or not. By means of a letter dated 21 December 2012, Condat SAS undertook to sign a new contract
for the supply of steam for an additional period up to 31 December 2016 but decided not to purchase
the tangible assets. The new contract was signed on 17 January 2014. It grants Condat SAS an option
to purchase 100% of the tangible assets for a total price of EUR 5 M as at 31 December 2016, or for
their Net Booked Value in case of early termination.

**38.3. Assignment of trade receivables**

From time to time, Lecta Group assigns trade receivables to financial institutions through
non-recourse agreements.

Such operations are accounted for in conformity with the accounting policy described in Note 1.37.

– Factoring: The corresponding advance is accounted for in the borrowings and disclosed in
Note 28.4. There was none as at 31 December 2013.

F-304


-----

**NOTES — (Continued)**

– Non-recourse invoice discounting and factoring: The residual commitment computed using the
continuous involvement methodology is accounted for in the borrowings and disclosed in
Note 28.4. The face value of these discounted invoices was EUR 41.7 M as at 31 December
2013.

– Non-recourse assignment: In such case, there is no residual commitment.

**38.4. Derivatives on foreign currencies**

The Lecta Group operations are impacted by the fluctuations of the non-euro currencies, mainly
USD and GBP.

At 31 December 2013, ordinary sales and purchases were specifically hedged through:

– Forward agreements on realized sales in foreign currencies: . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . EUR 28.6 M
– Forward agreements on realized purchases in foreign currencies: . . . . . . . . . . . EUR 13.6 M

The impact of these contracts has been accounted for as fair value hedging, hence recognized in
the Income statement (see Note 1.36).

There were no options on future sales in foreign currencies and on future purchases in foreign
currencies. Therefore, nothing had to be fair valued through Income statement.

Furthermore, in June 2007, Alto Garda Power SrL entered into a 13-year agreement with Italia
General Electric SpA, in order to execute the planned maintenance of the new cogeneration plant for
the period 2008 to 2020.

On 20 September 2007, Alto Garda Power entered into several currency forward contracts for the
purpose of hedging part of its maintenance costs against any unexpected fluctuation of exchange rate of
USD.

As at 31 December 2013, the main characteristics of these instruments were as follows.

**Notional**
**Value at 31 Dec 2013 (in EUR K)**
**amount** **Maturity** **Exchange**
**Instrument** **(in K USD)** **date** **rate** **Intrinsic** **Time** **Total**

transaction . . . . . . 1,699 various 1.4332 22 32 54

The impact of these contracts has been accounted for as cash flow hedge. The intrinsic value,
considered as effective, was recognized directly in Equity while the time value was considered as
ineffective, and thus recognized in the Income statement (see Note 1.36).

**38.5. Hedging derivatives on interest rates**

_2012 Floating rate notes:_

On 28 June and 6 July 2012, the interest rates of 51% of the 2012 Floating rate notes (see
Note 3.1) were hedged with Caps indexed to 3-month Euribor for the period from mid- August 2012 to
mid-August 2014.

_Alto Garda Power SrL:_

On 5 September 2007, the interests rates of 50% of the forecast debt in Alto Garda Power SrL
(see Note 28.4) were hedged with a Collar indexed to 6 month Euribor for the period from June 2007
to December 2018.

On 16 March 2010, the interests rates of 25% of the forecast debt were hedged with a Swap to
exchange 6 month Euribor variable rate against fixed rate of 2.995% for the period June 2010 to
December 2018.

F-305


-----

**NOTES — (Continued)**

In December 2012, Alto Garda Power SrL voluntarily repaid EUR 12 M of its debt. Following this
repayment, the notional amounts of the Collar and the Swap were higher than the debt. Consequently,
the Collar and part of the Swap were considered as hedging instruments, while the balance of the Swap
was no more considered as hedging instrument.

On 18 December 2013, the Swap to exchange 6 month Euribor variable rate was terminated.

_IDAE Sant Joan AIE:_

On 23 July 2010, the interest rates of 75% of the forecast debt in IDAE Sant Joan AIE (see
Note 28.4) were hedged with a Swap to exchange 1 month Euribor variable rate against fixed rate of
2.14% for the period from June 2011 to March 2016.

The main characteristics of the above instruments are as follows.

**Value at 31 Dec 2013**
**(in EUR K)** **Notional** **Premium** **Effective** **Termination** **Floor** **Cap**
**Instrument** **amount** **paid** **date** **date** **rate** **rate** **Strike** **Intrinsic** **Time** **Total**

(1,895) (326) (2,221)

The impact of these agreements has been accounted for as cash flow hedge, except for the balance
of the Swap in Alto Garda Power SrL that was accounted for as fair value hedge as at 31 December
2012.

For the cash flow hedge, the intrinsic value, considered as effective, was recognized directly in
Equity while the time value was considered as ineffective, and thus recognized in the Income statement.
For the fair value hedge, any gain or loss from re-measuring the hedging instrument at fair value is
recognized in the Income statement (see Note 1.36).

**38.6. Hedging derivatives on energy prices**

Lecta Group operations are impacted by the fluctuations of gas and electricity prices.

The biomass cogeneration plant of Zaragoza uses black liquor, a by-product of its pulp production,
to supply electricity and steam.

In 2011, Torraspapel Group entered into a Swap agreement for a portion of its sale of electricity
produced from biomass. As at 31 December 2012, there was one Swap in place:

Total **0** **1** **1**

The impact of this agreement has been accounted for as cash flow hedge. The intrinsic value,
considered as effective, was recognized directly in Equity while the time value was considered as
ineffective, and thus recognized in the Income statement

As at 31 December 2013, there were no hedging derivatives on energy price in place.

**38.7. Fair value of financial instruments**

Fair value hierarchy

F-306


-----

**NOTES — (Continued)**

Lecta Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial
instruments by valuation technique:

– Level 1: quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities

– Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs that have a significant effect on the recorded
fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly.

– Level 3: techniques that use inputs that have a significant effect on the recorded fair value
that are not based on observable market data.

As at 31 December 2013, Lecta Group held the following financial instruments:

**At 31 December 2013** **At 31 December 2012**

observable.

had to be applied, as they were all short-term.

**NOTES — (Continued)**

**39.4. Market risk**

Lecta Group profit is affected by cyclical changes in the overall economic activity and exposed to
variations in the price of paper, raw materials and energy.

To reduce their impacts:

– Lecta Group customer base is highly diversified in terms of geography and channels of sales.

– Lecta Group produces part of its needs of pulp, the main raw material used in the production
of paper. It also produces part of its energy requirement.

– Lecta Group signed multi-year contracts of pulp and some other raw materials supply.

– Lecta Group signed multi-year contracts of energy supply.

The table below illustrates how a change in selected factors (on the assumption that other factors
are neutral) related to Lecta Group’s business may affect financial performances. Based on actual
figures of 2013:

**Estimated effect on**
**Lecta Group**
**Changes** **EBITDA (in EUR M)**

Paper prices . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . +/�10 EUR/T +/�16.5

Volume produced and sold . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . +/�10 KT +/�2.3

**39.5. Currency risk on transactions**

Lecta Group’s EBITDA is exposed to the fluctuations of non-euro currencies on future sales and
purchases.

Favorable (unfavorable) impacts on EBITDA of a decrease of 0.01 of exchange rate [e.g. for USD/
EUR from 1.33 (average in 2013) to 1.32, or for GBP/EUR from 0.85 (average in 2013) to 0.84], all
other things being equal, based on actual figures of 2013, are:

**Currency** **EUR M**

USD . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . �1.0

Lecta Group covers the fluctuations of non-euro currencies, mainly USD and GBP, according to
the following rules (see Note 38.4):

– Statement of financial position approach for trade receivables and payables: on a regular basis,
the actual sales and purchases denominated in non-euro currencies are covered through
forward agreements with fixed expiry dates consistent with those of the hedged items.

Since 2007, it includes a long-term maintenance contract of Alto Garda Power denominated in
USD.

– Income statement approach for forecast incomes and expenses: on an occasional basis, a part
of the future sales and purchases to be made in non-euro currencies may be covered through
forward agreements or options for a maximum period of six months.

**39.6. Interest rate risk**

Lecta Group’s profit before tax is exposed to the fluctuations of interest rate, as a vast proportion
of its Borrowings is indexed to 3 month Euribor.

F-309


-----

**NOTES — (Continued)**

Unfavorable impact on profit before tax of an increase of 1% (100 basis points) of 3 month
Euribor [e.g. from 0.220% (average in 2013) to 1.220%], all other things being equal, based on actual
figures of 2013, is:

**Interest rate** **EUR M**

3M Euribor . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . �2.9

Lecta Group hedges part of its Borrowings in order to reduce the impact of interest rate
fluctuations (see Note 38.5). Lecta Group’s counterparts are leading financial institutions that have a
credit rating equal to or better than A-2 short-term or BBB long-term ratings (or equivalent).

**39.7. Currency risk on investments**

Lecta Group has no significant investments in the non-euro zone.

**39.8. Currency risk on Borrowings**

The borrowings of Lecta Group are essentially denominated in euro.

**39.9. Business risk**

Lecta Group negotiates insurance policies for major risks, such as property damage & business
interruption, and general liability. Lecta Group also invests in the prevention and the protection of its
assets following the recommendations by leading insurance companies.

**40. Events after the Statement of financial position date**

In the context of the reallocation of its production capacities, in 2013 Lecta decided to install a
second-hand Paper Machine n�7 in its Zaragoza mill to produce base paper to be converted into
specialty papers by Leitza plant. The investment aims at maximizing the use of pulp produced on the
site, thus reducing drying and transportation costs of pulp to other mills.

This decision entailed the permanent closure of Berrobi / Uranga mill (with a production capacity
of 27,000 tons of base paper) at the end of January 2014 (see Note 3.5.2 and 11). A provision for
restructuring of EUR 0.8 M was booked in the line ‘‘Non recurring items’’ in February 2014.

Probably, this decision will result in the need to reconsider the role of Sarri`a de Ter paper mill
(with a production capacity of 65,000 tons of base paper and UWF) and Cogeneraci´on del Ter
cogeneration plant (with a power of 25MW) (see Notes 3.5.2 and 11).
