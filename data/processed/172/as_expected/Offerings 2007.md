**LISTING MEMORANDUM**

# Lecta S.A.

#### €748,000,000
 €598,000,000 Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes due 2014 €150,000,000 Senior Unsecured Floating Rate Notes due 2014 guaranteed on a senior basis by certain Subsidiaries of Lecta S.A.

_______________

Lecta S.A. (the “Issuer”) is offering €598,000,000 aggregate principal amount of senior secured floating rate notes due 2014 (the “Secured
Notes”) and €150,000,000 aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured floating rate notes due 2014 (the “Unsecured Notes,” and collectively with
the Secured Notes, the “Notes”). Interest on the Notes will be paid quarterly on each February 15, May 15, August 15 and November 15,
commencing May 15, 2007. At any time on or after February 15, 2008, the Notes may be redeemed in whole or in part by paying a specified
premium.

The interest on the Secured Notes will be three-month EURIBOR plus 262.5 bps, reset two days before the beginning of each quarterly interest
period. The interest on the Unsecured Notes will be three-month EURIBOR plus 400.0 bps, reset two days before the beginning of each quarterly
interest period.

The Issuer is a holding company conducting its operations through its subsidiaries. If we undergo a change of control or sell certain of our assets,
we may be required to offer to purchase the Notes from you. In addition, we may redeem all, but not part, of the Notes at a price equal to their
principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, upon the occurrence of certain changes in applicable tax law.

The Secured Notes will be general secured senior obligations of the Issuer, and the Unsecured Notes will be general unsecured senior obligations
of the Issuer. The Notes will rank equally in right of payment with all the Issuer’s existing and future senior indebtedness. Certain of our subsidiaries
(the “Guarantors”) will guarantee the Notes on a senior basis (the “Guarantees”). The Secured Notes and related Guarantees will be secured, along
with obligations under the Issuer’s revolving credit facility, by security interests over certain assets of the Issuer and certain subsidiaries of the Issuer,
including shares of Guarantors. The laws of certain jurisdictions limit the enforceability of guarantees and of the rights to the collateral, if any,
securing such guarantees.

This listing memorandum includes information on the terms of the Notes, including redemption and repurchase prices, covenants and transfer
restrictions. For a more detailed description of the Notes and the Guarantees, including applicable limits on enforceability, see “Description of the
Secured Notes,” “Description of the Unsecured Notes” and Annex A hereto.

Application has been made to admit the Notes to listing on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and to trading on the Euro MTF
market. We expect that the Notes will be made ready for delivery in book-entry form through Euroclear and Clearstream, on or about February 13,
2007, against payment in immediately available funds.

**Investing in the Notes involves a high degree of risk. See “Risk Factors” beginning on page 32.**

_______________

**The Notes have not been registered under the U.S. federal securities laws or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction. The initial**
**purchasers named below are offering the Notes only to qualified institutional buyers in accordance with Rule 144A of the U.S. Securities Act**
**of 1933, as amended, and to persons outside the United States in accordance with Regulation S of the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as**
**amended. See “Notice to Investors” for additional information about eligible offerees and transfer restrictions.**

_______________

Neither the Notes nor the Guarantees have been or will be registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “U.S.

pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act.

The Notes are being offered and sold outside the United States in reliance on Regulation S and within the United States to
“qualified institutional buyers” (“QIBs”) in reliance on Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act (“Rule 144A”). Prospective
purchasers are hereby notified that the sellers of the Notes may be relying on the exemption from the provisions of Section 5 of the
U.S. Securities Act provided by Rule 144A. For a description of these and certain other restrictions on offers, sales and transfers of the
Notes and the distribution of this listing memorandum, see “Notice to Investors.”

**The Notes have not been approved or disapproved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), any state**
**securities commission in the United States or any other U.S. regulatory authority, nor have any of these authorities passed**
**upon or endorsed the merits of this offering or the accuracy or adequacy of this listing memorandum. Any representation to**
**the contrary is a criminal offense in the United States.**

Further, no securities authority in Luxembourg has approved or disapproved these Notes or determined whether this listing
memorandum is truthful or complete. This listing memorandum, and any other offering circular, prospectus, form of application,
advertisement or other material is only being distributed in, or otherwise made available in, or from or published in, Luxembourg for
the sole purpose of the admission of the Notes to the official list of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the admission of the Notes to
trading on the Euro MTF market, except in circumstances which do not constitute an offer of securities to the public.

The Notes are subject to restrictions on transferability and resale and may not be transferred or resold except as permitted under
the U.S. Securities Act and applicable state securities laws pursuant to registration thereunder or exemption therefrom. You should be
aware that you may be required to bear the financial risks of this investment for an indefinite period of time.

This listing memorandum does not constitute an offer to sell or an invitation to subscribe for or purchase any of the Notes in any
jurisdiction in which such offer or invitation is not authorized or to any person to whom it is unlawful to make such an offer or
invitation. Laws in certain jurisdictions may restrict the distribution of this listing memorandum and the offer and sale of the Notes.
Persons into whose possession this listing memorandum or any of the Notes are delivered must inform themselves about and observe
those restrictions. Each prospective purchaser of the Notes must comply with all applicable laws and regulations in force in any

purchaser must obtain any consent, approval or permission required under the regulations in force in any jurisdiction to which it is
subject or in which it purchases, offers or sells the Notes.

Neither the Issuer nor the Initial Purchasers shall have any responsibility for obtaining such consent, approval or permission.

We have summarized certain documents and other information in a manner we believe to be accurate, but we refer you to the
actual documents for a more complete understanding of the matters we discuss in this document. You should not consider any
information in this document to be legal, business or tax advice. You should consult your own attorney, business advisor and tax

We accept responsibility for the information contained in this listing memorandum. We have made all reasonable inquiries and
confirm to the best of our knowledge, information and belief that the information contained in this listing memorandum with regard to
us, our subsidiaries and affiliates and the Notes is true and accurate in all material respects, that the opinions and intentions expressed
in this listing memorandum are honestly held and that we are not aware of any other acts the omission of which would make this
listing memorandum or any statement contained herein misleading in any material respect.

We reserve the right to withdraw this offering of the Notes at any time. We and the Initial Purchasers also reserve the right to
reject any offer to purchase the Notes in whole or in part for any reason or no reason and to allot to any prospective purchaser less than
the full amount of the Notes sought by it.

**_In connection with this issue, Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch or persons acting on its behalf may over-allot or effect_**
**_transactions with a view to supporting the market price of the Notes at a level higher than that which might otherwise prevail._**
**_However, Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch is under no obligation to do this. Such stabilizing, if commenced, may be_**
**_discontinued at any time and must end no later than the earlier of 30 days after the issue date of the Notes and 60 days after the_**
**_date of the allotment of the Notes._**

**NOTICE TO EEA INVESTORS**

This listing memorandum has been prepared on the basis that all offers of Notes will be made pursuant to an exemption under the
Prospectus Directive, as implemented in Member States of the European Economic Area (“EEA”), from the requirement to produce a
prospectus for offers of securities. Accordingly, any person making or intending to make any offer within the EEA of Notes, which are
the subject of the placement contemplated in this listing memorandum, should only do so in circumstances in which no obligation
arises for the Issuer or the Initial Purchasers to produce a prospectus for such offer. Neither the Issuer nor the Initial Purchasers have
authorized, nor do they authorize, the making of any offer of Notes through any financial intermediary, other than offers made by the
Initial Purchasers, which constitute the final placement of Notes contemplated in this listing memorandum.

In relation to each Member State of the EEA which has implemented the Prospectus Directive (each, a “Relevant Member State”)
an offer to the public of any Notes may not be made in that Relevant Member State, except that an offer to the public in that Relevant
Member State of any Notes may be made at any time under the following exemptions under the Prospectus Directive, if they have
been implemented in that Relevant Member State:

(a) to legal entities which are authorized or regulated to operate in the financial markets or, if not so authorized or regulated,
whose corporate purpose is solely to invest in securities;

(b) to any legal entity which has two or more of (1) an average of at least 250 employees during the last financial year; (2) a total
balance sheet of more than €43,000,000; and (3) an annual net turnover of more than €50,000,000, as shown in its last annual
or consolidated accounts;

(c) by the Initial Purchasers to fewer than 100 natural or legal persons (other than qualified investors as defined in the Prospectus
Directive) subject to obtaining the prior consent of Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch for any such offer; or

4


-----

(d) in any other circumstances falling within Article 3(2) of the Prospectus Directive; provided that no such offer of Notes shall
result in a requirement for the publication by the Issuer, any Guarantor or the Initial Purchasers of a prospectus pursuant to
Article 3 of the Prospectus Directive.

For the purposes of this provision, the expression an “offer to the public” in relation to any Notes in any Relevant Member State
means the communication in any form and by any means of sufficient information on the terms of the offer and any Notes to be
offered so as to enable an investor to decide to purchase any Notes, as the same may be varied in that Relevant Member State by any
measure implementing the Prospectus Directive in that Relevant Member State and the expression “Prospectus Directive” means
Directive 2003/71/EC and includes any relevant implementing measure in each Relevant Member State.

**NOTICES TO CERTAIN EUROPEAN INVESTORS**

**The Netherlands**

Each of the Initial Purchasers represents and agrees that (a) it is a professional market party (“PMP”) within the meaning of
Section 1(e) of the Exemption Regulation of June 26, 2002 in respect of the Act on the Supervision of the Credit System 1992
(Vrijstellingsregeling Wtk 1992), as amended from time to time (the “Exemption Regulation”), where applicable read in conjunction
with the policy rules of the Dutch Central Bank (de Nederlandsche Bank N.V.) on key concepts of market access and enforcement of
the Act on the Supervision of the Credit System 1992 (Wet toezicht kredietwezen 1992) published on December 29, 2004
(Beleidsregel 2005 kernbegrippen markttoetreding en handhaving Wtk 1992) (the “Policy Rules”), and Section 2 of the Policy Rules,
as amended, supplemented and restated from time to time and (b) it has offered or sold and will offer or sell, directly or indirectly, as
part of the initial distribution or at any time thereafter, the Notes exclusively (i) to PMPs as reasonably identified by the Issuer on the
date of the issuance of the Notes or (ii) to persons which cannot reasonably be identified as PMPs by the Issuer on the date of the
issuance of the Notes, provided that the Notes have a denomination of €50,000 (or the equivalent in any other currency) and shall
upon their issuance be included in a clearing institution that is established in an EU Member State, the United States, Japan, Australia,
Canada or Switzerland; so that it can reasonably be expected that the Initial Purchasers will transfer the Notes exclusively to other
PMPs.

Generally, Notes (including rights representing an interest in a global note) may not be offered, sold, transferred or delivered at
any time by anyone, directly or indirectly, to individuals or legal entities who or which are established, domiciled or have their
residence in The Netherlands (“Dutch Residents”) other than to PMPs acquiring the Notes for their own account. Dutch Residents, by
purchasing Notes (or any interest therein), will be deemed to have represented and agreed for the benefit of the Issuer that (i) they are
a PMP and acquire the Notes for their own account, (ii) such Notes (or any interest herein) may not be offered, sold, pledged or
otherwise transferred to Dutch Residents other than to a PMP acquiring for its own account or for the account of another PMP and (iii)
they will provide notice of this transfer restriction to any subsequent transferee.

In addition, and without prejudice to the relevant restrictions set out above, the Notes that are offered in The Netherlands, may
only be offered and such an offer may only be announced: (i) if the Notes have a denomination of at least €50,000 or the equivalent in
any other currency; (ii) if the Notes, irrespective of their denomination, can be acquired only as a package for a consideration of at
least €50,000 or the equivalent in any other currency; and/or (iii) to professional market parties within the meaning of Section 1a
paragraph 3 of the Exemption Regulation to the Dutch Securities Supervision Act 1995 (Vrijstellingsregeling Wet toezicht
effectenverkeer 1995); and otherwise (iv) in accordance with the Dutch Securities Supervision Act 1995 (Wet toezicht effectenverkeer
1995) and corresponding regulations, as amended from time to time.

**Switzerland**

The Notes may be offered in Switzerland on the basis of a private placement, not as a public offering. The Notes will neither be
listed on the SWX Swiss Exchange nor are they subject to Swiss law. This listing memorandum therefore neither constitutes a
prospectus within the meaning of Art. 1156 of the Swiss Code of Obligations or Arts. 32 et seq. of the Listing Rules of the SWX
Swiss Exchange, nor does it comply with the Directive for Notes of Foreign Borrowers of the Swiss Bankers Association.

**United Kingdom**

experience in matters relating to investments falling within Article 19(5) of the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 (Financial
Promotion) Order 2005 (the “Order”); (iii) are high net worth companies, unincorporated associations and other persons to whom it
may lawfully be communicated, falling within Article 49(2)(a) to (d) of the Order; or (iv) are persons to whom an invitation or
inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of Section 21 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000) in
connection with the issue or sale of any Notes may otherwise lawfully be communicated (all such persons together being referred to as
“relevant persons”). This listing memorandum is directed only at relevant persons and must not be acted on or relied on by persons
who are not relevant persons. Any investment or investment activity to which this document relates is available only to, and will be
engaged in only with, relevant persons.

**INFORMATION REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS**

This listing memorandum includes forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of
forward-looking terminology, including the terms “believe,” “estimate,” “anticipate,” “expect,” “intend,” “may,” “will” or “should”
or, in each case, their negative, or other variations or comparable terminology. These forward-looking statements include all matters
that are not historical facts. They appear in a number of places throughout this listing memorandum and include statements regarding
our intentions, beliefs or current expectations concerning, among other things, our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity,
prospects, growth, strategies and the industry in which we operate and predictions and forecasts of industry experts upon which we
rely.

By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties because they relate to events and depend on
circumstances that may or may not occur in the future. We caution you that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future
performance and that our actual results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and the development of the industry in which
we operate, may differ materially from those made in or suggested by the forward-looking statements contained in this listing
memorandum. In addition, even if our actual results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and the development of the
industry in which we operate, are consistent with the forward-looking statements contained in this listing memorandum, those results
or developments may not be indicative of results or developments in subsequent periods. Important factors that could cause those
differences include, but are not limited to:

   - industry conditions, including cyclicality in the prices of our products and the raw materials used to make them, competition
and production capacity;

   - our ability to generate sufficient cash to satisfy our commitments and fund our capital expenditures;

   - our reliance on a limited number of customer accounts for a significant amount of our revenue;

   - our ability to realize cost reduction and efficiency improvement;

   - the cost of compliance with environmental, tax and other laws and regulations;

   - the possibility of major disruptions in production at our facilities, including risks associated with our labor relations;

6


-----

   - changing customer preferences or the development of new technologies;

   - consequences of our high leverage; and

   - other risks and uncertainties inherent to our business and to general local and global economic conditions.

We urge you to read the sections of this listing memorandum entitled “Risk Factors,” “Operating and Financial Review and
Prospects,” “Industry and Market Overview” and “Business” for a more complete discussion of the factors that could affect our future
performance and the industry in which we operate. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the forward-looking events
described in this listing memorandum may not occur.

We undertake no obligation to publicly update or publicly revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new
information, future events or otherwise. All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us or to persons
acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements referred to above and contained elsewhere in
this listing memorandum.

**PRESENTATION OF INDUSTRY AND MARKET INFORMATION**

We have generally obtained the market and competitive position data in this listing memorandum from industry publications and
from surveys or studies conducted by third-party sources that we believe to be reliable, including CEPIFINE aisbl (“CEPIFINE”),

Federation of Manufacturers and Converters of Self-Adhesive and Heat-Seal Materials on Paper and Other Substrates (“FINAT”), the
European Thermal Paper Association (“EPTA”) and the European Metallizers Association (“EMA”). However, we cannot assure you
of the accuracy and completeness of such information and we have not independently verified such market and position data. Many of

information not within Pöyry’s control. Pöyry does not make any representation or warranty as to the accuracy, correctness or
completeness of the data or of any analysis thereof contained in such information, or any other recommendation, representation or
warranty whatsoever concerning such information. In addition, Pöyry has no duty to update or supplement any such information.
Pöyry is not responsible for any actions (or lack thereof) taken by any investors or other third parties as a result of relying on or in any
way using such information, and in no event shall Pöyry be liable for any damages resulting from reliance on or use of such
information, whether such liability is asserted to arise in contract, negligence, strict liability or other theory of law.

In addition, in many cases we have made statements in this listing memorandum regarding our industry and our position in the
industry based on our experience and our own investigation of market conditions. We cannot assure you that any of these assumptions
are accurate or correctly reflect our position in the industry, and none of our internal surveys or information have been verified by any

**PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION**

Unless otherwise indicated, financial information in this listing memorandum is presented in euro and, as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2005 and the nine months ended September 30, 2005 and 2006, has been prepared in accordance with IFRS, as of and
for the year ended December 31, 2004, has been prepared in accordance with both Luxembourg GAAP and IFRS, and as of and for
the years ended December 31, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2003, has been prepared in accordance with Luxembourg GAAP. IFRS and
Luxembourg GAAP differ in certain significant respects from U.S. GAAP.

There are significant differences between Luxembourg GAAP and IFRS. Material differences with respect to recognition and
measurement between Luxembourg GAAP and IFRS are summarized in note 3.1 to our audited consolidated financial statements as of
and for the year ended December 31, 2005, included elsewhere in this listing memorandum.

Some financial information and other numerical data in this listing memorandum have been rounded and, as a result, the numerical
figures shown as totals in this listing memorandum may vary slightly from the exact arithmetic aggregation of the figures that precede
them.

In this listing memorandum and our financial statements, we report EBITDA. We define EBITDA as earnings before depreciation,
amortization, unusual items, finance costs, net income from associates and income tax. EBITDA includes non-cash expenses and
incomes, consisting of variations of inventories and operating provisions. EBITDA does not necessarily indicate whether cash flow
will be sufficient or available for cash requirements and may not be indicative of our results of operations. In addition, EBITDA as we
define it may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies. Moreover, EBITDA as presented herein
and in our financial statements is not calculated in the same way as “EBITDA” is calculated under the Indentures and the RCF.

**Our Company**

We are the largest coated woodfree paper manufacturer in Southern Europe (consisting primarily of Spain, Portugal, France and
Italy) and the third largest coated woodfree paper manufacturer in Europe, with an annual production capacity of 1,500,000 metric
tons. We are also one of the leading manufacturers of specialty papers in Europe, with an annual production capacity of 220,000
metric tons. In addition, we operate a 230,000 metric ton pulp mill in Spain, which provides approximately 30% of our overall pulp
requirements for all of our coated woodfree paper mills. We have ten coated woodfree paper machines and six specialty paper
machines in eleven mills located at various sites in Italy, France and Spain. In the year ended December 31, 2005, our mills produced
an aggregate of 1,359,100 metric tons of coated woodfree paper and 222,200 metric tons of specialty papers, including uncoated
paper, a type of specialty paper produced by our coated woodfree paper mills. We market our products principally in Spain, Portugal
and France, where we rank first by market share, in Italy, where we rank second by market share, and also in other European countries
and, to a lesser extent, outside of Europe. Our mills are located in close proximity to our key commercial printing markets in Spain,
Portugal, France and Italy, where, according to CEPIFINE, approximately 35% of European commercial printing deliveries of coated
woodfree paper are made (9% in Spain, 1% in Portugal, 12% in France and 13% in Italy). During the year ended December 31, 2005,
we had total sales of €1,414.8 million and EBITDA of €183.0 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2006 and the
twelve months ended September 30, 2006, we had total sales of €1,075.0 million and €1,433.7 million, respectively, and EBITDA of
€105.4 million and €149.1 million, respectively.

The Lecta group was initially formed by CVC Capital Partners Limited (“CVC”) in 1997 to acquire Cartiere del Garda S.p.A.
(“Garda”) of Italy in October of that year, and it subsequently acquired Condat S.A.S. (“Condat”) of France in November 1998 and
Torraspapel S.A. (“Torraspapel”) of Spain in December 1999, all three of which are long-established paper manufacturing companies.
Garda, Condat and Torraspapel produce coated woodfree paper for sale under their own brand names, which we believe are wellestablished in the European market. Torraspapel also produces a variety of specialty papers, including thermal, metallized and selfadhesive papers. In addition, Torraspapel acts as a distributor of coated woodfree paper and speciality papers in Spain, Portugal and
France, and in the year ended December 31, 2005, Torraspapel distributed approximately 430,000 metric tons of paper, of which
82,500 metric tons were produced by third parties.

We have a high-quality asset base, which achieves excellent operating performance. Between 1999 and 2003, we invested €499.6
million in rebuilding our papermaking, coating and converting machines, reducing costs and improving productivity, enhancing our
information technology, implementing environmental and safety improvements and maintenance. As a result of our capital
expenditures, the coated woodfree paper capacity of our mills has grown from approximately 1,000,000 metric tons in 1999 to
1,500,000 metric tons currently. We have accomplished this expansion in production capacity through upgrades to our existing
machines rather than by the addition of new machines. Over the same period, we have reduced both our variable and fixed costs
through machine modernization and various cost reduction initiatives, including coordination of sales and marketing and raw material
purchases and extensive internal and external benchmarking of our production processes. From 2001 to 2006, we increased our metric
tons of paper and pulp produced per employee from 306 metric tons to 392 metric tons, representing an increase in metric tons of
paper and pulp produced per employee of approximately 28%.

(2) Includes, as applicable, revenues and EBITDA from sales of paper produced by third parties and sold by Torraspapel and sales of
excess energy produced by our cogeneration facilities.

**Our Strengths**

We believe we have a number of competitive advantages, including:

**_Strong Market Positions in Coated Woodfree Paper. We are the market leader for coated woodfree paper in Southern Europe._**
The following table sets forth our estimated rankings and market share in our principal markets for coated woodfree paper.

**Ranking** **Market Share(1)**
Spain and Portugal... #1 44%
France...................... #1 29%
Italy.......................... #2 26%

__________

(1) Includes sales by Torraspapel of approximately 82,500 metric tons of paper produced by other paper manufacturers.

The majority of our products are sold under our own brand names, and according to an industry study commissioned in 2005, our
brands have the highest name recognition among our target customers in Spain and Italy and the second highest name recognition
among our target customers in France. We engage in a variety of targeted promotional activities and advertising to enhance the
recognition of our brands, as we believe that this helps to differentiate our products.

**_Optimal Location of Mills, Proximity to Customers. Our mills are strategically located in close proximity to key commercial_**
printing markets in Southern Europe. According to CEPIFINE, approximately 35% of European commercial printing deliveries of
coated woodfree paper take place in Spain, Portugal, France and Italy. The strategic location of our mills allows us to keep
transportation costs, which are generally a substantial portion of sales prices, low relative to those of our competitors, particularly our
competitors with mills in Nordic countries. In addition, although most large industrial paper machines produce paper onto reels, most
demand for coated woodfree and specialty papers in Europe is for sheeted paper. As a result, most paper produced by paper mills
needs to be converted to sheets, and in general this conversion takes place following specific customer orders. To reduce the delivery
time of customers’ orders, paper manufacturers must operate converting facilities close to their principal markets. The proximity of
our mills to our customers allows for sheet converting to take place at our mill sites, which results in cost savings and improved
inventory management and customer service. Many of our Nordic competitors incur higher transportation costs and thus are at a
competitive disadvantage from having to ship reeled paper to remote converting facilities located near to customers and then ship it on
to customers. Moreover, maintaining converting facilities at or near our mills provides us with cost savings due to our ability to reuse
the paper waste created from the cutting process. We believe that being in close proximity to our customers also allows us to provide
higher levels of customer service.

**_Attractive and Growing End-User Market. We are well positioned to benefit from growth in the Southern European markets and_**
growth in the coated woodfree paper markets. According to CEPIFINE, the market for coated woodfree paper in Southern Europe
grew at a rate of 1.7%, 2.4%, and 1.4% higher than the growth rate for Western Europe as a whole during the years 2003, 2004 and
2005, respectively, reflecting higher economic growth in Southern Europe. In addition, the market for coated woodfree paper
historically has grown at a faster rate than markets for other types of paper in response to demand from customers in growing markets
for advertising and commercial printing. We expect this trend to continue in the future.

**_Well-Invested Asset Base and Efficient Low-Cost Production. All of our paper machines were modernized through a series of_**
investment projects between 1999 and 2003, and as a result, our production capacity increased by 50% between 1999 and 2006. With
an average annual output of between 115,000 and 230,000 metric tons each, our coated woodfree paper machines are among the most
efficient in Europe. We believe that the efficiency of our paper machines, coupled with low transportation and sheet converting costs,
provides us with a cost advantage in our key markets. We believe, for example, that on a delivered basis, we are the lowest cost
producer in Europe for shipments to Madrid, Milan and Paris, where a significant number of our customers are located. If warranted
by market conditions, we could increase our coated woodfree paper production by 130,000 metric tons per year without additional
capital investment by eliminating commercial downtime in our mills.

**_Flexibility and Variety in Production. We manufacture our coated woodfree paper on medium-width machines, which we believe_**
are better suited for the production of most coated woodfree paper products than the wider-width machines that many of our
competitors use. Because the coated woodfree paper market generally demands a greater variety of basis weights and surface finishes
than other types of graphic paper, these machines allow us to produce our paper in a broad range of basis weights and coated surface
finishes while maintaining optimal production runs with minimal waste and downtime between runs.

**_Successful Distribution Business Directly Linked to Customer Base._** In addition to their production operations, our Spanish
operations include a highly successful distribution business, which distributes both our own coated woodfree and specialty papers and
those produced by third parties. This distribution business enhances our ability to provide a high level of customer service by
improving our understanding of our customers’ product and service needs, which allows us more effectively to develop and market
new products to meet such requirements.

(BAR CHART)

**_Skilled Personnel, Incentivized Management and Sponsor Support. Our management team is experienced and is highly regarded_**
by participants in the paper industry. We maintain a decentralized organizational structure and continue to run Garda, Condat and
Torraspapel as separate operating subsidiaries. Each of the three subsidiaries has its own CEO with over 20 years of experience in the
paper industry. With an aggregate equity stake in Lecta S.A. of approximately 8.6%, our management team is highly incentivized. In
addition, each of our senior managers has been granted an incentive package with a strong focus on increasing sales, productivity and
cash generation. We also benefit from the relationships, investment experience and expertise with manufacturing companies of our
controlling shareholder, CVC, a leading international private equity and investment advisory firm, whose Industrial Advisory Board
includes members with diverse manufacturing backgrounds.

**Our Strategy**

Our objectives are to build on our position as the leading coated woodfree paper producer in Southern Europe. The key elements of
our strategy are as follows:

**_Maintain Low-Cost Production and Achieve Further Operating Efficiencies. We believe we are a low cost producer due in large_**
part to our past capital investment projects, which have improved the efficiency of our machines. We seek to improve the efficiency of
all of our mills and thereby to increase our cost competitiveness and margins. We are taking a number of measures to increase
productivity as measured by metric tons produced per employee. Our three operating subsidiaries continually share best practices to
increase production efficiency, optimize technological processes, manage risks and reduce costs. We also measure the performance of
each of our mills against internal and external benchmarks relating to operational key indicators and raw material consumption. We
are replicating our success in energy cogeneration in Spain by replacing our existing cogeneration facility in Italy. Following its
expected completion in 2008, we estimate it will improve Garda’s EBITDA by approximately €10 million to €12 million per year.
This facility will require a total investment of approximately €50 million, of which, as of October 31, 2006, €1.3 million has been
invested.

-----

**_Focus on Higher-Margin Products. We continue to shift our product mix towards products that generate higher margins, such as_**
sheeted coated woodfree paper and coated woodfree paper in higher grades and weights, and we are focusing our marketing and
distribution efforts on customers who require these products. In specialty papers, in response to declining demand for carbonless
paper, we are shifting our product mix toward thermal, metallized and self-adhesive papers, all three of which have been experiencing,
and which we expect will continue to experience, growing demand. Our close proximity to European commercial printing markets,
our flexible printing platform and dedication to customer service enable us to effectively shift our product mix.

**_Focus on Our Customers in the Southern European Market. We intend to continue to focus on the Southern European market_**
where we enjoy a cost advantage over Nordic competitors and a leading market position. We may seek to further enhance our
customer focus by expanding our distribution capabilities into our French and Italian operations, while maintaining our relationships
with third party distributors. We may also seek to expand our direct sales to end users.

**_Enhance Cash Flows. We seek to enhance our cash flows through the foregoing strategies and intend to continue to maintain a_**
disciplined capital expenditure program to maximize our cash flow available for debt reduction. Since 1998, we have repaid €427.3
million principal amount of debt, €219.9 million of which has been made as voluntary pre-payments. Between 1999 and 2003, we
incurred significant capital expenditures to rebuild and modernize our machines, reduce costs and improve productivity. Going
forward, other than for the cogeneration facility in Italy, we do not expect any major new capital expenditure projects other than
capital expenditures necessary to maintain the operating performance of our mills.

**Industry Trends and Outlook**

In recent years, the European coated woodfree paper industry has experienced overcapacity, caused by a period of industry-wide
investment in new production capacity coupled with slower demand growth due to unfavorable economic conditions, which together
have led to reduced paper prices. This operating environment also has been affected by increasing raw material costs, particularly pulp
and energy costs. The financial performance of the industry, including our financial performance, has been negatively impacted during
this period of oversupply.

**_Overcapacity_**

In response to challenging conditions in the paper industry, some of our competitors have announced shutdowns of manufacturing
facilities. Specifically, UPM-Kymmene Corporation closed production capacity at two of its facilities during the third quarter of 2006
and has also announced the planned closure of another facility in the second quarter of 2007; Stora Enso has announced its intention to
close two of its facilities during 2007; and M-real has confirmed that it will close one facility by January 31, 2007 and reduce
production at another by February 28, 2007. After giving effect to the announced shutdowns, but without taking into account capacity
creep, European coated woodfree paper production capacity is expected to decrease by 6% by the end of 2007, which should improve
the supply/demand imbalance in Europe and contribute to improved price stability.

The following graph, reproduced from a Pöyry study, illustrates trends and Pöyry’s forecasts for European coated woodfree paper
capacity and production.

**European Coated Woodfree Paper Capacity and Production**
**(capacity utilization is indicated at the bottom of each bar)**

**LOGO**

_Source: Market Update and Price Forecast, November 22, 2006, Pöyry._

As the graph above indicates, capacity utilization is forecasted to increase from 91% in 2006 to 94% in 2007 and 95% in 2008. We
believe that the European coated woodfree paper industry’s pricing power historically has strengthened when capacity utilization
reaches 95%.

According to CEPIFINE, the growth rate in demand for coated woodfree paper in Southern Europe was 1.7%, 2.4% and 1.4%
higher than that for Western Europe as a whole for the years 2003, 2004 and 2005, respectively.

15


-----

According to Pöyry, in 2007, demand for coated woodfree paper in Europe is expected to increase by 1.6% for the year compared
to a demand increase of 2.2% for 2006. Pöyry predicts that demand will grow at a slower pace during the first half of 2007 and will
improve during the second half of 2007.

Pöyry predicts demand in Europe for coated woodfree paper will grow by 2.3% to 3.6% per year between 2008 and 2010, based
on, among other things, an assumption that the economy will be stronger and, as a result, spending on advertising will increase. This
demand growth is predicted despite planned coated woodfree paper capacity expansions in Asia, which are largely expected to supply
the Asian market and may impact Asian demand for both reels and sheeted products produced in Europe.

**_Paper and Pulp Prices_**

During this period of overcapacity and reduced paper prices, pulp prices have increased, causing a narrowing of the “Gap,” an
industry indicator, defined by Pöyry, and calculated as the difference between the price of coated woodfree paper in Germany and
60% of the price of bleached hardwood kraft pulp, which are, in turn, benchmark figures used in the coated woodfree paper industry.
The graph below illustrates historical prices for, and Pöyry’s forecasts for the development of, coated woodfree paper prices, bleached
hardwood kraft pulp prices and the Gap.

**Historical and Forecasted Hardwood Pulp and Coated Woodfree Paper Prices**

**LOGO**

_Source: Market Update and Price Forecast, November 22, 2006, Pöyry._

In the near term, Pöyry expects coated woodfree paper prices to increase by approximately 4%, from €820 per ton in 2005 to €855
per ton by 2007. In the third and fourth quarters of 2006, we and a number of our competitors announced price increases. Pöyry
expects pulp prices to decline in the near term as a result of new pulp production capacity coming on-stream. According to Pöyry, this
increased pulp capacity will increase supply in the market between late 2006 and 2008, with a significant part of the capacity growth
in Latin America. Pöyry predicts that the average price of bleached hardwood kraft pulp will decline by 10.6% during 2007 as a result
of this increased supply. According to the graph above, in the third quarter of 2006, the Gap reached a low point and has since
improved. Forecasted increases in the price of coated woodfree paper and decreases in the price of pulp would be expected to lead to
an increased Gap over the following quarters.

**Recent Developments**

**_Preliminary Fourth Quarter Results_**

Based on preliminary data, we estimate that volumes sold for the three months ended December 31, 2006 will be approximately
425,000 metric tons of paper, an increase of approximately 2.6%, from 414,000 metric tons of paper sold in the three months ended
December 31, 2005, and an increase of approximately 2.1% from 416,300 metric tons of paper sold in the three months ended
September 30, 2006.

We estimate that our EBITDA for the three months ended December 31, 2006 will be 20-25% lower than our EBITDA for the
three months ended December 31, 2005 of €43.7 million. This decrease in EBITDA relative to the fourth quarter of 2005 is
attributable to our significantly lower gross margins throughout 2006 primarily as a result of higher pulp, energy and transportation
costs, which we were unable to pass onto our customers due to continued industry overcapacity.

                                     - rank pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future debt of
such Secured Note Guarantor that is not subordinated to such Secured
Note Guarantee;

                                     - rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future
subordinated obligations of such Secured Note Guarantor;

21


-----

                                     - be secured by a security interest in favor of the Security Trustee in
certain of such Secured Note Guarantor’s assets, including shares in
certain subsidiaries, but not all assets and no real property; and

                                     - be effectively subordinated to any existing and future debt of such
subsidiary that is secured with property and assets that do not secure
such Guarantee, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such
debt.

**Security ...........................................................** The Secured Notes and related Guarantees will be secured by security interests in
certain of the Issuers’ or the Guarantors’ assets, consisting, in the case of the Issuer,
of its shares in Sub Lecta 1 S.A. and Sub Lecta 2 S.A., the Intercompany Loans
held by it, and in the case of the several Secured Note Guarantors, of shares in
certain subsidiaries held by such Secured Note Guarantors and certain other assets.

The security interests with respect to the Secured Notes and the Secured Note
Guarantees will be first ranking except that the RCF and certain hedging debt will
be repaid in priority upon enforcement of the security.

The security interests will be granted by the Guarantors and the Issuer in favor of
the Security Trustee for the benefit of the finance parties under the RCF, the parties
providing hedging and the Secured Notes Trustee as trustee for the holders of the
Secured Notes.

As a result of the above-described security arrangements, the Secured Notes
Trustee on behalf of the holders of the Secured Notes will be a beneficiary of
security over shares and other assets of companies having an aggregate of over
€135 million of unconsolidated EBITDA for the twelve months ended September
30, 2006.

The security arrangements for the Secured Notes vary from subsidiary to subsidiary
depending on applicable legal restrictions and other factors. Moreover, these
arrangements are limited in amount and scope, and those limitations are significant.
For more information, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes,” “Risk
Factors—Risks Related to the Secured Notes,” “Description of the Secured
Notes—Credit Enhancement” and Annex A to this listing memorandum.

**Intercreditor**
**Agreement ......................................................** Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, the Secured Notes Trustee will agree to

certain provisions that, among other things, give effect to the priority of proceeds.
In particular, proceeds from the sale of the collateral shall be applied first in favor
of the lenders under the RCF and certain hedging debt and thereafter to the Secured
Notes Trustee on behalf of holders of Secured Notes. In addition, the Intercreditor
Agreement provides that only the Security Trustee can enforce security. See
“Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement.”

**Optional Redemption.....................................** We may redeem the Secured Notes in whole or in part at any time on or after

22


-----

February 15, 2008 at the redemption prices described under “Description of the
Secured Notes—Optional Redemption.”

**Additional Amounts; Tax**
**Redemption.....................................................** All payments in respect of the Secured Notes will be made without withholding or

deduction for any taxes or other governmental charges, except to the extent

less than the amount you would have received in the absence of such withholding
or deduction. See “Description of the Secured Notes—Additional Amounts.”

If certain changes in the law of any relevant taxing jurisdiction become effective
that would impose withholding taxes or other deductions on the payments on the
Secured Notes or the Secured Note Guarantees, we may redeem the Secured Notes
in whole, but not in part, at any time at a redemption price equal to their principal
amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, and additional amounts, if any, to
the date of redemption.

**Change of Control..........................................** If we experience a Change of Control, as defined in the Secured Indenture, we will
be required to make an offer to purchase all outstanding Secured Notes at a
redemption price of 101% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued interest to
the date of repurchase.

governing its other indebtedness.

**Ranking of the Unsecured**
**Notes................................................................** The Unsecured Notes will be senior unsecured obligations of the Issuer and will:

                                     - rank pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future debt of
the Issuer that is not subordinated to the Unsecured Notes;

                                     - rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future debt of the
Issuer that is subordinated to the Unsecured Notes;

                                     - be structurally subordinated to all liabilities (including trade
payables), disqualified stock and preferred stock of the Issuer’s
subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Unsecured Notes; and

                                     - will be effectively subordinated in right of payment to all existing and
future secured debt of the Issuer and any Guarantor, including the
Secured Notes and indebtedness under the RCF, to the extent of such
secured debt.

**Unsecured Note**
**Guarantees......................................................** The Unsecured Notes will be guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis (the

“Unsecured Note Guarantees”) by the following subsidiaries of the Issuer (the
“Unsecured Note Guarantors”):

                           - Sub Lecta l S.A.;

                           - Sub Lecta 2 S.A.;

                            - Cartiere del Garda S.p.A.;

                           - Sarriopapel y Celulosa S.A.

The Unsecured Note Guarantees may be released in certain circumstances,
including upon the sale of an Unsecured Note Guarantor. Moreover, the obligations
of each Unsecured Note Guarantor under its Unsecured Note Guarantee will be
limited to an amount that can be guaranteed under applicable laws, including
corporate benefit laws and financial assistance, fraudulent conveyance or
fraudulent transfer restrictions under applicable insolvency laws, and will not apply
to the extent a guarantee would be illegal or unenforceable under applicable local
laws.

**Ranking of the Unsecured**

such Unsecured Note Guarantor that is not subordinated to such
Unsecured Note Guarantee;

                                     - rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future
subordinated obligations of such Unsecured Note Guarantor; and

                                     - be effectively subordinated in right of payment to all existing and
future secured debt of such Guarantor, including the Secured Notes and
indebtedness under the RCF, to the extent of such secured debt.

**Security ...........................................................** None.

**Other Provisions of the Secured Notes and the Unsecured Notes**

Certain Covenants............................................ We will issue the Secured Notes and the Unsecured Notes under the Secured
Indenture and the Unsecured Indenture, respectively, among, inter alia, the Issuer,
the Guarantors, the Secured Notes Trustee and the Unsecured Notes Trustee under
such Indenture and, with respect to the Secured Notes, the Security Trustee. The
Secured Indenture and Unsecured Indenture will, among other things, limit our
ability to:

                                  - incur or guarantee additional indebtedness;

                                  - pay dividends or make other distributions or repurchase or redeem our
stock;

                                  - make investments or other restricted payments;

                                  - create liens;

                                  - consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets.

All of these limitations will be subject to a number of important qualifications and
exceptions. See “Description of the Secured Notes— Certain Covenants” and
“Description of the Unsecured Notes—Certain Covenants.”

any other applicable securities laws. The Notes are subject to restrictions on
transferability and resale. See “Notice to Investors.”

market. Accordingly, there can be no assurance as to the development or liquidity
of any market for them. The Initial Purchasers have advised us that they intend to
make a market in the Notes. However, they are not obligated to do so and may

The following tables contain our summary historical consolidated financial information. Our summary historical consolidated
financial information as of and for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2005 is extracted or derived from our consolidated
financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this listing memorandum. These consolidated financial statements have
been audited by Ernst & Young S.A., independent reporting accountants. Our summary historical consolidated financial information
as of and for the year ended December 31, 2003 is extracted or derived from consolidated financial statements which have not been
included in this listing memorandum. The unaudited interim consolidated financial information as of September 30, 2006 and for the
nine months ended September 30, 2005 and 2006 contained herein is extracted or derived from and should be read in conjunction with
the unaudited interim consolidated financial information included elsewhere in this listing memorandum, and the unaudited
consolidated financial information for the twelve months ended September 30, 2006 contained herein is extracted or derived from and
should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2005 and the
unaudited interim consolidated financial information for the nine months ended September 30, 2006 included elsewhere in this listing
memorandum. The unaudited interim consolidated financial information as of September 30, 2006 and for the nine months ended
September 30, 2005 and 2006 and the unaudited consolidated financial information for the twelve months ended September 30, 2006
are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any other period or for the year ended December 31, 2006 and
should not be used as the basis for, or prediction of, an annualized calculation. In the opinion of management, the unaudited interim
consolidated financial information and the unaudited consolidated financial information have been prepared on a basis consistent with
our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein and include all adjustments, consisting only of normal
recurring adjustments, which management considers necessary for a fair presentation of our consolidated results of operations and
cash flows as of September 30, 2006 and for the nine months ended September 30, 2005 and 2006 and for the twelve months ended
September 30, 2006.

Our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto as of and for the year ended December 31, 2005, the
unaudited interim consolidated financial information as of September 30, 2006 and for the nine months ended September 30, 2005 and
2006, and the unaudited consolidated financial information for the twelve months ended September 30, 2006, have been presented in
euro and prepared in accordance with IFRS. Our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto as of and for
the year ended December 31, 2004 have been presented in euro and prepared in accordance with both Luxembourg GAAP and IFRS.
Our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2003 have been presented in euro and prepared in
accordance with Luxembourg GAAP. IFRS and Luxembourg GAAP differ in certain significant respects from U.S. GAAP.

The following tables combine the presentation of our financial information under Luxembourg GAAP and IFRS. As a result,
certain line items may not be comparable. There are significant differences between Luxembourg GAAP and IFRS. Our financial
results prepared in accordance with Luxembourg GAAP would have been significantly different if they had been prepared in
accordance with IFRS and, accordingly, our results under Luxembourg GAAP are not comparable with our results under IFRS. In
addition, Luxembourg GAAP accounts presented below are not indicative of future results under IFRS, and the trends indicated in
such Luxembourg GAAP accounts are not indicative of future trends under IFRS. Material differences with respect to recognition and
measurement between Luxembourg GAAP and IFRS are summarized in note 3.1 to our audited consolidated financial statements as of
and for the year ended December 31, 2005 included elsewhere in this listing memorandum.

__________

(1) Revenues consist of sales of paper (including paper produced by third parties and sold through Torraspapel’s distribution business)
and energy.

(2) We define EBITDA as earnings before depreciation, amortization, unusual items, finance costs, net income from associates and
income tax. EBITDA includes non-cash expenses and income, consisting of variations in inventories and operating provisions.
EBITDA does not necessarily indicate whether cash flow will be sufficient or available for cash requirements and may not be
indicative of our results of operations. In addition, EBITDA as we define it may not be comparable to other similarly titled

30

**September 30,**

measures used by other companies. Moreover, EBITDA as presented herein and in our financial statements is not calculated in the
same way as “EBITDA” is calculated under the Indentures and the RCF.

(3) Unusual items in 2005 included disposals of property, plant and equipment, ineffective portion in the variation of rate hedging
derivatives and other income and charges.

(4) Finance costs include interest on senior debt, rate hedging derivatives, amortization of issue costs on borrowings, senior debt and
other finance related expenses.

(5) We define total debt under IFRS as interest-bearing borrowings plus the current portion of interest-bearing borrowings, bank
overdrafts, loans and interest rate hedging receivables (payables) and under Luxembourg GAAP as borrowings.

(6) Total net debt represents total debt as defined above less cash and cash equivalents.

(7) Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents is calculated net of bank overdrafts.

(8) We define EBITDA here as we define it in footnote 2 above, and we repeat EBITDA here as a line item for convenience.

(9) EBITDA margin is calculated as the ratio of EBITDA to revenues.

(10) Capital expenditure represents the purchase of equipment for the purposes of cost reduction and productivity improvement,
maintenance, paper machine rebuilds, information technology and environment and safety.

(11) Pro forma net debt is derived by giving effect to the Refinancing as described under “Summary—The Refinancing” as if it had
occurred at the end of the period.

(12) Pro forma net cash interest expense reflects the estimated cash interest expense net of interest income that would have been
payable during the twelve months ended September 30, 2006 as adjusted to give effect to the Refinancing as if it had occurred at
the beginning of the period. For the avoidance of doubt, this number excludes the following non-cash items: amortization of
issue costs on borrowings (€2.7m), finance costs in the provisions on employee benefits (€1.1m) and other IFRS adjustments
(€0.2m). This number also excludes the following cash items: interest on rate hedging derivatives, which expired in June 2006
(€6.1m), and the cost of early payment discounts unrelated to interest-bearing borrowings (€11.8m). These non-cash and cash
items are included in the financial income (expense)/finance costs line item included in our income statement and are broken out
in note 11 to our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2005 included elsewhere in
this listing memorandum.

(13) Tons per employee is calculated as the ratio of metric tons of pulp and paper produced to the number of employees. Certain of
our employees included in the calculation are not involved in the paper production process.

**RISK FACTORS**

_You should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision. The risks described below are not_
_the only ones we face. Additional risks not presently known or currently deemed immaterial may also impair our business, results of_
_operations and financial condition. Our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected_
_by any of these risks. The trading price of the Notes could decline due to any of these risks, and you may lose all or part of your_
_investment. This listing memorandum also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results_
_could differ materially from those anticipated in such forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including the risks we_
_face that are described below and elsewhere in this listing memorandum._

**Risks Related to Our Business**

**_Product prices and raw material costs in our industry are volatile, and periods of low product prices or high raw material costs_**
**_negatively affect our profitability and cash flows._**

Prices for our products are affected by industry-wide production and capacity levels and by demand for our products, which is
influenced by global economic trends, demographic trends, technological developments, trends in end-user preferences and inventory
levels maintained by our customers. Changes in these factors have resulted in significant fluctuations in the prices for our products.
The timing and the magnitude of changes in our product prices have varied significantly over time and have been unpredictable.
Changes in prices differ between products and geographic regions. While we are a significant participant in most of the markets in
which we compete, neither our actions nor those of any one industry participant have more than a small influence on changes in
product prices.

As a response to historically high profitability in the industry in the late 1990s, significant investments were made industry-wide in
2000 and 2001 in Europe to increase production capacity. This has led to excess capacity in Europe over the past five years. During
the same period, the market has experienced decreased sales to Asia of the excess European production resulting from a combination
of increased local production capacity in Asia and the weak U.S. dollar. The excess capacity in Europe and lower demand from Asia
have resulted in downward pressure on the prices of paper products in Europe. In addition, exports from Europe to the United States
have been adversely affected by the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the euro. As a result, in this environment of excess capacity,
we may not be able to maintain our current price levels or increase prices for our products in the absence of an increase in demand for
paper products, including export opportunities, or a significant decrease in production capacity. While some competitors have
indicated an intention to reduce capacity, there can be no assurance that the announced decisions to decrease production capacity will
balance the market in Europe or increase or stabilize paper prices, or that such shutdowns will occur at all. In addition, planned
production capacity expansion in Asia, which is expected to be significant, would result in lower demand for European production,
and may also result in greater import competition from Asia in the European market. Decreasing prices for our products could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, as our mills are not
operating at their full capacity, we may have difficulty managing our costs.

Our main raw material costs are for pulp and energy. In recent years, pulp and energy prices have been highly volatile, and energy
prices have significantly increased. Due to overcapacity in the European paper market, European paper manufacturers have been
unable to pass on increases in the prices of pulp, energy and other raw materials to their customers. Therefore, European paper
manufacturers’ margins have significantly eroded. We have experienced price increases for electricity, gas and other raw materials,
and we expect further cost increases throughout 2007. These price increases are expected to have a negative impact on our results of
operations for the fourth quarter of 2006 and at least the first quarter of 2007. A further significant increase in prices for these raw
materials would significantly increase our production costs and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition, results of operations and cash flows if we were unable to increase our product prices sufficiently to maintain margins.
Compared to many of our competitors, we are particularly susceptible to volatility in pulp prices because we have a lower degree of
pulp integration and do not hedge against fluctuations in the price of pulp. As a result of unpredictable and substantial changes in our
product prices and raw material costs, our financial results have varied significantly over time. In a period of sustained low product
prices or high raw material costs, we may be unable to operate our production facilities in a cost-effective manner, pursue our strategic
initiatives and meet all of our financial obligations.

32


-----

The combination of the foregoing factors has had, and will continue to have, a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition, results of operations and cash flows.

**_Changes in economic conditions, consumer preferences or new technologies may affect our business and our ability to compete_**
**_successfully._**

Much of the demand for our products is generated directly or indirectly by advertising, whether by printers, direct mail campaigns,
magazine publishers or other ultimate end-users of paper. As a result, when the economy is growing, our customers’ demand for our
products generally increases, but when the economy slows, advertising and promotional expenditures are generally cut back and our
customers’ demand for our products declines. Historically, when the global economy is growing, spending on advertising increases
sooner and at a faster rate than the overall economic growth rate, and conversely, when the global economy slows, spending on
advertising decreases sooner and to a greater extent than the overall economic slowdown. We are therefore vulnerable to a weakening
economy, and any slowing or perceived slowing of the economy in general or the advertising market in particular could be expected to
have an adverse impact on our customers’ demand for our products and, therefore, to adversely affect our business, financial
condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Changes in consumer preferences affect both the demand for paper in general and the demand for specific grades of paper. Our
ability to continue to meet the shifting demands of paper consumers depends upon a variety of factors, including our ability to foresee
or identify changes in consumer preferences. Some of the most significant changes in consumer preferences include interest in
environmentally-friendly products and the use of e-mail and electronic media instead of paper. The widespread availability of
electronic media and the internet and the trend towards ever greater use of computers may reduce demand for paper and generally
have a significant adverse impact on future paper consumption patterns.

In addition, we believe that new technologies or novel processes may emerge and that existing technologies may be further
developed in the fields in which we operate, both of which could impact production methods or product quality. Unexpected rapid
changes in employed technologies or the development of novel processes that affect our operations and product range could render the
technologies we utilize or the products we produce obsolete or less competitive in the future. If we are unable to successfully
anticipate technological developments, we may be forced to implement these new technologies at a substantial cost. Any such
development could materially and adversely impact our business, financial conditions, results of operations and cash flows.

**_We face intense competition in our industry._**

Our business is highly competitive, and competition is mainly based on price. We frequently experience pricing pressure from
competitors in many of our product lines and geographic markets. Our ability to compete effectively depends on our cost
competitiveness. Some of our competitors may be lower cost producers than we are in certain markets and may offer our customers
competing products with more attractive prices. This competitive environment has been a principal factor behind the large fluctuations
in profitability we have experienced in recent years.

We compete principally with a number of large international paper companies, as well as with numerous regional and more
specialized competitors. Many of our competitors have advantages that can adversely impact our ability to compete with them. These
advantages include lower raw material and labor costs, as well as fewer environmental and governmental regulations to comply with
than we do. In particular, our competitors who operate fully-integrated production processes are not as vulnerable to increases in the
cost of pulp and so are able to sustain lower prices without suffering deteriorating margins at times of high raw material prices.
Furthermore, some of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we have or may be better positioned than we are
to compete in certain geographic areas.

In addition, competitive pressures have required us to make significant investments in our manufacturing facilities and in product
development. There can be no assurance that we will have sufficient resources to maintain similar levels of capital investment in the
future. In addition, the following factors will affect our ability to compete:

   - the quality of our products;

   - our breadth of product offerings;

33


-----

   - our ability to maintain plant efficiencies and high operating rates and thus lower our average manufacturing costs per ton;

   - customer service and our ability to distribute our products on time; and

   - the availability and/or cost of pulp, energy and other raw materials and labor.

Increased competition could cause us to lose market share, increase expenditures or reduce pricing, any of which could have an
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of our operations.

**_Our business requires significant ongoing capital expenditures._**

We incur capital expenditures on an ongoing basis to maintain our equipment and to comply with environmental and safety laws,
as well as to enhance the efficiency of our operations.

Our total capital expenditures were €31.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2006. We expect to spend
approximately €69.0 million on capital expenditures in 2007, including approximately €10 million towards the construction of a
cogeneration facility at our mill in Riva del Garda, Italy.

We anticipate that our available cash resources, including drawings that we may make under the RCF, and cash generated from
operations will be sufficient to fund our operating needs and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future. However, if we require
additional funds to fund our capital expenditures, we may not be able to obtain them on favorable terms, or at all. Furthermore, if we
cannot maintain or upgrade our facilities and equipment as we require or as necessary to ensure environmental compliance with
current or future regulations, it could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

**_A limited number of customers account for a significant portion of our revenue._**

We sell a significant portion of our products to a limited number of major customers that represent a substantial portion of our
revenues. In the year ended December 31, 2005, our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 25% of our total net sales and
one customer accounted for more than 10% of our total net sales. We have entered into a master purchase agreement with this
customer, which will terminate on February 28, 2009. See “Business—Customers.” The loss of, or reduction in orders from, any of
these customers or other customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and
cash flows, as could significant customer disputes regarding shipments, price, quality or other matters.

**_Consolidation within the European paper distribution industry may increase the buying power of our customers._**

We currently have a diversified customer base comprised predominantly of paper distributors. The European paper distribution
industry is currently highly fragmented but is beginning to undergo some consolidation. Further consolidation within the European
paper distribution industry would increase the buying power of our customers, which could have an adverse effect on our business,
financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

**_We may not realize all of the projected benefits of our cost reduction and efficiency improvement programs._**

Our business strategy is to maximize our cash flow in part by implementing initiatives aimed at achieving cost savings and
generating profitable growth. We may not be able to realize all of the projected benefits of our cost reduction and efficiency
improvement programs or to realize them in the timeframe currently expected. For example, we may encounter unanticipated
difficulties or delays and/or cost overruns in completing the new cogeneration facility we are intending to construct in Riva del Garda.

**_We may face high costs for compliance with and clean-up under environmental laws and regulations, which would reduce profit_**
**_margins and earnings._**

Our business is subject to extensive environmental, health and safety laws and regulations relating to controlling discharges and
emissions of pollutants to land, water and air, to the use and preservation of natural resources, to the noise impact of our operations
and to the use, disposal and remediation of hazardous materials. Compliance with these laws and regulations is a significant factor in
our business, and substantial legal and financial resources are required to ensure compliance and to manage environmental risks.

34


-----

Moreover, environmental laws and regulations applicable to us are likely to become more stringent in the future. For example, the EU
Emissions Trading Scheme, which implements the Kyoto Protocol in the countries in which our mills operate, is expected to require
reductions from current emission levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases during the next phase of regulation from 2008
to 2012. Our mills and cogeneration facilities generate such gases, and any future limitations applicable to us may require material
expenditures and may have other adverse consequences. In addition, most of our facilities in Spain are in the process of being licensed
under the EU Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control regime, and conditions imposed by authorities as part of this licensing
scheme may require material capital and other expenditures. We could be subject to potentially significant fines, penalties, criminal
sanctions or remediation obligations for any failure to comply with such limitations and conditions or with any other environmental
laws or regulations applicable to us.

Our industry also faces increasing public and community pressure to consume energy more efficiently, including through the use
of renewable fuels, and to reduce waste. In addition, the European paper industry faces increasing pressure to procure wood and pulp
from sustainably managed forests through a number of certification schemes. We have implemented and will continue to implement
measures in an effort to address these concerns, which may require us to invest substantial resources in adjusting and modifying our
production processes.

Some of our properties are located on land with a long history of industrial use by us and other companies before us, which has
resulted in spills and other releases of hazardous materials over time. The limited testing for contamination that has taken place at
certain of our properties may not be sufficient to ascertain the extent of our obligations with respect to any contamination relating to
any of our facilities. The laws of the jurisdictions in which we operate can impose liability on an owner or occupier of property for
contamination at or emanating from the property, regardless of who caused the contamination, when it was caused or whether the
activity that caused the contamination was legal at the time. We have incurred costs to investigate and remediate contamination in the
past and may in the future be subject to substantial costs and liabilities relating to contamination.

The risk of substantial environmental costs and liabilities is inherent in our industry, and there can be no assurance that our
incurrence of such costs and liabilities, or the adoption of increasingly strict environmental laws, regulations and enforcement policies
and practices, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, we
could become subject to significant liabilities and claims relating to damage to property or natural resources or injury to persons,
including employees, resulting from the environmental, health or safety impacts of our operations or past contamination, such as
claims alleging illness or death from exposure to hazardous materials used, produced or disposed of by us.

**_Substantially all of our employees are members of labor unions and we may face labor disruptions that could interfere with our_**
**_operations and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations._**

The majority of our employees are represented by labor unions under various collective bargaining agreements in the different
countries where we operate. Upon the expiration of any existing collective bargaining agreements, we may not be able to reach new
agreements on terms satisfactory to us without labor disruption. Our non-union facilities may become subject to labor union
organizing efforts that, if successful, could increase the risk of work stoppages and potentially lead to higher labor costs.

Although management believes its relationship with employees is good, there can be no assurance that there will not be labor
disputes and/or adverse employee relations in the future. Disruptions of business operations due to strikes or similar measures by our
employees or the employees of any of our significant suppliers could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition,
results of operations and cash flows.

**_Our business is conducted under various administrative controls._**

Our operations are subject to the general supervision of various public administrative authorities, including labor, tax and
environmental authorities. We believe that we manage our business in a manner that conforms with general practice in our industry
and that complies with applicable administrative rules, regulations and procedures. However, we cannot assure you that our
interpretation and application of such rules, regulations and procedures will not differ from the views of the relevant public authorities
as to their appropriate interpretation and application. These public authorities may audit, review or inspect our activity. To the extent
any such audit, review or inspection reveals discrepancies between the interpretations and applications made by us and those made by
the relevant public authority, we may experience an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash
flows.

35


-----

**_Our insurance is limited and subject to exclusions._**

We operate a significant number of manufacturing facilities. We currently have in place a number of different insurance policies
that cover property damage and losses due to the interruption of our business, subject to customary conditions. We believe that this
coverage is adequate to cover the risk of loss resulting from any damage to our property or the interruption of any of our business
operations. However, the insurance policies are subject to limits and exclusions. There can be no assurance that our insurance program
would be sufficient to cover all potential losses or that we will be able to obtain sufficient levels of property insurance coverage in the
future or that such coverage will be available on terms acceptable to us.

**_Our operations could be adversely affected if we are unable to retain key employees._**

We depend on our senior management. Our performance and ability to implement our strategy depend on the efforts and abilities
of our executive officers and key employees. Our operations could be adversely affected if, for any reason, a number of these officers
or key employees do not remain with us. There may be a limited number of persons with the requisite skills to serve in these positions
and we may be unable to replace key employees with qualified personnel on acceptable terms. In addition, our future success requires
us to continue to attract and retain competent personnel.

**Risks Related to the Secured Notes**

**_Creditors under the RCF and certain hedging debt are entitled to be repaid with the proceeds of collateral sold in any enforcement_**
**_sale in priority of the holders of Secured Notes._**

In the event of a foreclosure on the liens securing the Secured Notes and the Secured Note Guarantees, the proceeds from the sale
of the assets securing the Secured Notes may not be sufficient to satisfy Lecta S.A.’s obligations under the Secured Notes or the
obligations of the Secured Note Guarantors under the Secured Note Guarantees. Any proceeds from a sale of collateral would be
distributed first to satisfy debt and obligations incurred under the RCF and hedging debt, and thereafter to the Secured Notes Trustee
on behalf of holders of Secured Notes. No appraisals of the collateral have been prepared by or on behalf of us in connection with the
issuance of the Secured Notes. By its nature, some or all of the collateral will be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market
value. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the collateral could be sold in a short period of time, if at all. See “Description of
the Secured Notes—Security.”

**_The ability of the Security Trustee to enforce the collateral may be restricted by local law._**

Under Luxembourg law, the validity, legality, performance and enforceability of the collateral is subject to, and may be affected or
limited by, the provisions of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation, moratorium or reprieve from payment (sursis de
_paiement), controlled management (gestion contrôlée), general settlement or composition with creditors (concordat préventif de_
_faillite), fraudulent conveyance, reorganization or similar Luxembourg or foreign laws affecting the rights of creditors generally and_
thus the ability of the Security Trustee to enforce the collateral may be restricted by such laws.

Under Italian law, a security interest created pursuant to a pledge is not validly enforceable for the benefit of a beneficiary who is
not a direct party to the relevant pledge agreement. Therefore, the Security Trustee under the Secured Notes is entering into an
agreement with Cartiere del Garda S.p.A., our Italian subsidiary pledging security to secure the Secured Notes, under which the
Security Trustee will become the holder of the pledge on behalf of the holders of the Secured Notes. However, if a claim before an
Italian court challenging the validity or enforceability of the security interests created by the pledges were successful, holders of the
Secured Notes may be unable to recover any amounts under the pledges.

Under French law, a pledge over shares may be enforced at the option of the Security Trustee either (i) by means of a sale of the
pledged shares in a public auction (the proceeds of the sale being paid to the secured creditors and any excess over the amount of the
secured debt being paid to the legal owner of the collateral) or (ii) by attribution judiciaire or _conventionnelle of the shares to the_
Security Trustee, following which the Security Trustee becomes the legal owner of the pledged shares. In a proceeding for attribution
_judiciaire or conventionnelle, under option (ii), an expert values the collateral (in this case, the shares) and, if the expert determines_
that the value of the collateral exceeds the amount of secured debt, the Security Trustee may be required to pay the obligor an amount,
the soulte, equal to the difference between the value of the shares as determined by the expert and the amount of the secured debt. This

36


-----

is true regardless of the actual amount of proceeds ultimately received by the Security Trustee from a subsequent sale of the pledged
shares.

As a result, if the Security Trustee enforces the collateral pursuant to option (i), the proceeds of the sale of the collateral may not
be sufficient to satisfy the claims of all secured creditors. If the Security Trustee enforces the collateral pursuant to option (ii), there is
a risk that the secured creditors may not be able to sell the collateral for its full value as determined by the court-appointed expert, yet
still be required to pay the pledgor, at the time the Security Trustee becomes the legal owner of the collateral, the difference between
the value of the collateral and the amount of the secured debt if the collateral is determined by the court-appointed expert to have a
greater value than the amount of the secured debt.

Under Spanish law, the ability of the Security Trustee to enforce the collateral consisting of pledges governed by Spanish law may
be restricted. In this regard, you should be aware of the following:

   - Spanish law does not expressly forbid the possibility of creating more than a single pledge over the same assets or rights.
Nevertheless, some scholars and practitioners believe that Spanish law may indirectly forbid the creation of multiple pledges
over the same assets or rights. To the best of our knowledge, there is no Spanish Supreme Court case law that directly resolves
this issue.

   - Catalan law expressly forbids granting more than one pledge over the same assets or rights (unless the pledges are given for the
benefit of the same creditors).

   - Under Spanish law, pledges are governed by the law where the pledged assets are located (“lex res sitae”). Collateral
consisting of concurrent pledges over the same assets will be governed by Spanish State law (which, as described above, does
not expressly forbid granting more than one pledge over the same asset), as these assets will be located in a place where only
Spanish State law is applicable. Nevertheless, there is a risk that a Spanish court might construe the location of these assets as
an abnormal change of their usual location for the purpose of avoiding a specific lex res sitae and, therefore, apply the law
which has been circumvented. If by virtue of the foregoing such Spanish court decides to apply Catalan law (which, as
described above, expressly forbids granting more than one pledge over the same asset), only one of the pledges granted over
the same assets will remain valid, and the remaining pledges will be deemed null and void.

   - Spanish law does not recognize the concept of security trustees and, therefore, trust structures may not be recognized by
Spanish courts. In this case, there is a risk that a Spanish Court would consider a pledge given for the benefit of a security
trustee as a number of concurrent, independent pledges, each of them securing the rights of each of the individual beneficiaries
of the trust. In this case, if these pledges are governed by Catalan law, only one of the pledges will be valid, and the remaining
pledges will be deemed null and void.

   - As a result, the Security Trustee may not be able to enforce the pledges on behalf of all of the secured creditors, and secured
creditors treated under Spanish law as not having the benefit of the pledges effectively may be treated as unsecured creditors.

**_The collateral securing the Secured Notes may be released without the consent of the holders of the Secured Notes._**

The collateral securing the Secured Notes may be released in certain circumstances, including in the event the collateral is sold
pursuant to an enforcement sale in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement. If such collateral consists of all of the shares of a
Guarantor, than such Guarantor’s Guarantee will also be released under such circumstances. See “Description of the Secured Notes—
Credit Enhancement—Release of Collateral” and “Description of the Secured Notes—Credit Enhancement—Release of Secured Note
Guarantees.”

Additionally, the Secured Indenture permits us to release and retake the security interest granted over the collateral securing the
Secured Notes in order to issue additional Secured Notes pursuant to the Secured Indenture. Upon the issuance of additional Secured
Notes pursuant to the Secured Indenture, there may be a time period imposed by applicable laws between the release and retaking of
the security interest during which there is no security interest over the collateral securing the Secured Notes. In some circumstances,
such as if we filed for bankruptcy after the issuance of additional Secured Notes, a hardening period may apply and retroactively void
the retaking of the security interest in favor of the holders of the Notes. Accordingly, there is a risk that, should we issue additional

37


-----

Secured Notes pursuant to the Secured Indenture, the collateral securing the Secured Notes could be released and its subsequent
retaking voided.

**Risks Related to the Unsecured Notes**

**_The Unsecured Notes are effectively subordinated to the Secured Notes and the RCF._**

In the event of an insolvency or liquidation, or if payment under the RCF or the Secured Notes or any other secured debt is
accelerated, the lenders under the RCF or the Secured Notes Trustee on behalf of the holders of the Secured Notes and holders of any
other secured debt will be entitled to exercise the remedies available to a secured lender under applicable law and will be paid out of
the assets pledged as collateral before these assets are made available to holders of the Unsecured Notes. In such event, the proceeds
from the sale of such assets may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations under the Unsecured Notes.

**_The Guarantees of the Unsecured Notes may be released without the consent of the holders of the Unsecured Notes._**

In the event all of the shares of an Unsecured Note Guarantor are sold, for example, pursuant to an enforcement sale in accordance
with the Intercreditor Agreement, then such Guarantor’s Guarantee of the Unsecured Notes will be released. See “Description of the
Unsecured Notes—Release of Unsecured Note Guarantees.”

**Risks Related to the Notes**

**_Our significant leverage may make it difficult for us to service our debt, including the Notes, and to operate our businesses._**

We are highly leveraged and have significant debt service obligations. As of September 30, 2006 and as adjusted to give effect to
the Refinancing, Lecta S.A. and its subsidiaries would have had €758.8 million of indebtedness, of which €748.0 million would have
been represented by the Notes. We anticipate that our high leverage will continue for the foreseeable future. Our high level of debt
may have important negative consequences for you, including:

   - making it more difficult for us and our subsidiaries to satisfy our obligations with respect to our debt, including the Notes and
other liabilities;

   - requiring that a substantial portion of the cash flow from operations of our operating subsidiaries be dedicated to debt service
obligations, reducing the availability of cash flow to fund internal growth through working capital and capital expenditures and
for other general corporate purposes;

   - increasing our vulnerability to economic downturns in our industry;

   - exposing us to interest rate increases;

   - placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt in relation to cash flow;

   - limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and our industry;

   - restricting us from pursuing strategic acquisitions or exploiting certain business opportunities; and

   - limiting, among other things, our and our subsidiaries’ ability to borrow additional funds or raise equity capital in the future
and increasing the costs of such additional financings.

In the worst case, an actual or impending inability by us or our subsidiaries to pay debts as they become due and payable could
result in our insolvency.

In addition, the Indentures and the RCF contain restrictions that substantially limit our financial and operational flexibility and that
of our subsidiaries. In particular, these agreements place limits on our ability to incur additional indebtedness, grant security interests

38


-----

to third persons, dispose of material assets, undertake organizational measures such as mergers, changes of corporate form, joint
ventures or similar transactions, and enter into transactions with related parties.

**_Despite our current significant leverage, we may be able to incur more debt in the future, which could further exacerbate the risks_**
**_of our leverage._**

We may incur more debt in the future. The RCF provides for total commitments of up to €75.0 million, of which €60.0 million is
committed, and no cash drawings will be outstanding on the date the Notes are issued. The Indentures will limit our ability to incur
additional debt but will not prohibit us from doing so. We may incur additional debt in the future that will be effectively senior to the
Unsecured Notes and that could mature prior to the Notes.

**_Lecta S.A. is a holding company and is dependent on payments from its subsidiaries in order to be able to make payments on the_**
**_Notes, and Lecta S.A.’s subsidiaries may not be permitted or otherwise able to make payments to Lecta S.A._**

Lecta S.A. is a holding company that conducts all of its operations through holding companies and their operating subsidiaries.
Other than the equity of Sub Lecta 1 S.A. and Sub Lecta 2 S.A. and its rights under the Intercompany Loans, Lecta S.A. does not have
any significant assets and does not, and will not, conduct any revenue generating operations. Lecta S.A. will therefore be dependent
upon the cash flow from its subsidiaries and the receipt of funds from them in the form of dividends, other distributions or
intercompany loans in order to make cash payments on the Notes or other obligations.

In addition, even if our subsidiaries generate sufficient cash from their operations, their ability to provide funds to Lecta S.A. is
subject to, among other things, local tax restrictions and local corporate law restrictions related to earnings, level of legal or statutory
reserves, losses from previous years and capitalization requirements for our subsidiaries. As a result, although we may have sufficient
resources, on a consolidated basis, to meet our obligations, our subsidiaries may not be able to make the necessary transfers to us to
permit us to satisfy our obligations under the Notes or otherwise. For example, local law restricts our subsidiaries’ ability to provide
funds to Lecta S.A. in the following ways:

   - restrictions under Luxembourg company law which require dividends to be distributed out of distributable reserves. Interim
dividends distribution by a public limited liability company is subject to strict conditions. A board of directors resolution
approving an interim dividend distribution must be passed and any interim dividends distribution may not occur less than six
months after the closing of the accounting year. Interim accounts must be drawn up by the board of directors, showing
available distributable reserves (this includes undistributed profits of prior accounting periods, the accounts of which have been
duly approved) and results for the current interim period. A report of the statutory auditor must be issued, confirming that the
legal conditions for an interim dividends distribution have been satisfied.

   - capital redemption or capital reduction is also subject to strict conditions under Luxembourg company law which may restrict
or delay the Luxembourg Guarantors or the Issuer in making certain payments or providing funds to the Issuer.

   - restrictions under the Italian Civil Code which require, among other things, each of our Italian subsidiaries to retain at least 5%
of its annual net profits in a legal reserve (riserva legale) until the reserve reaches at least 20% of such company’s share
capital;

   - restrictions under French company law which prohibit our French subsidiaries from paying dividends except out of profits
legally available for distribution as recorded in their statutory accounts. Our French subsidiaries’ profits that are legally
available for distribution may be substantially impacted by cash and non-cash charges to net income, including any asset writedowns they record; and

   - restrictions under Spanish corporate law which require, among other things, each of our Spanish subsidiaries to retain at least
10% of its annual net income in a legal reserve until the reserve reaches at least 20% of such company’s share capital and that,
after payment of any dividend, shareholders’ equity (after subtracting goodwill and start-up expenses) must exceed the
company’s share capital.

39


-----

**_We require a significant amount of cash to service our debt and for other general corporate purposes. Our ability to generate_**
**_sufficient cash depends on many factors beyond our control._**

Our ability to make payments on our debt, and to fund working capital and capital expenditures, will depend on our future
operating performance and ability to generate sufficient cash. This depends, to some extent, on general economic, financial,
competitive, market, regulatory and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, as well as the other factors discussed in these
“Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this listing memorandum.

Our business may not generate sufficient cash flows from operations, and additional debt and equity financing may not be
available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debts when due, including the Notes, or to fund our other liquidity
needs. For a discussion of our cash flows and liquidity, see “Operating and Financial Review and Prospects—Liquidity and Capital
Resources.”

If our future cash flows from operations and other capital resources are insufficient to pay our obligations as they mature or to fund
our liquidity needs, we may be forced to:

   - reduce or delay our business activities and capital expenditures;

   - sell assets;

   - obtain additional debt or equity financing; or

   - restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the Notes, on or before maturity.

We may not be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms, if at all. In addition, the
terms of our debt, including the RCF and the Notes, and any future debt that we may incur, may limit our ability to pursue any of these
alternatives.

**_The Guarantees are significantly limited by applicable laws and are subject to certain limitations or defenses._**

The Guarantors will guarantee the payment of the Notes as described in “Description of the Secured Notes—Credit
Enhancement—Guarantees” and “Description of the Unsecured Notes—Unsecured Note Guarantees.” The Guarantees provide the
holders of the Notes with a direct claim against the relevant Guarantor. However, the obligations of each Guarantor under its
Guarantees will be limited under the Indentures to an amount which has been limited so as to ensure that amounts payable will not
result in violations of laws relating to corporate benefit, capitalization, capital preservation, financial assistance or transactions under
value, or otherwise cause the Guarantor to be deemed insolvent under applicable law or such Guarantee to be deemed void,
unenforceable or ultra vires or cause the directors of such Guarantor to be held in breach of applicable corporate or commercial law
for providing such Guarantee. For a more detailed explanation of the precise limits on each Guarantee, see Annex A to this listing
memorandum.

As a result, a Guarantor’s liability under its Guarantees could be materially reduced or eliminated depending upon the amounts of
its other obligations and upon applicable laws. In particular, in certain jurisdictions, a guarantee issued by a company that is not in that
company’s corporate interests or the burden of which exceeds the benefit to the company may not be valid and enforceable. It is
possible that a Guarantor, a creditor of a Guarantor or the insolvency administrator, in the case of an insolvency of a Guarantor, may
contest the validity and enforceability of the respective Guarantee and that the applicable court may determine that the Guarantee
should be limited or voided. In the event that any Guarantee is deemed invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, or to the extent
that agreed limitations on the Guarantee apply, the Notes would be effectively subordinated to all liabilities of the applicable
Guarantor, including trade payables of such Guarantor.

**_Not all of our subsidiaries will guarantee the Notes, and any claim by us or any of our creditors, including the holders of the Notes,_**
**_against such non-Guarantor subsidiaries will be structurally subordinated to all of the claims of creditors of those non-Guarantor_**
**_subsidiaries._**

Not all of our existing and future subsidiaries will guarantee the Notes. On a consolidated unaudited basis as of September 30,
2006, we had total assets of €1,741.4 million and total debt of €765.6 million. In the twelve months ended September 30, 2006, Lecta
S.A. and the Guarantors had aggregate unconsolidated EBITDA of €114.8 million. The Indentures do not limit the transfer of assets
to, or the making of investments in, any of our restricted group members, including our non-guarantor subsidiaries. See “Description
of the Secured Notes—Certain Covenants” and “Description of the Unsecured Notes—Certain Covenants.” Accordingly, nonguarantor subsidiaries could account for a higher portion of our assets, liabilities, revenues and net income in the future.

In the event that any of our non-guarantor subsidiaries becomes insolvent, liquidates, reorganizes, dissolves or otherwise winds up,
the assets of such non-guarantor subsidiary will not be subject to claims from the holders of the Notes to satisfy their respective credits
against us and will be used first to satisfy the claims of the non-guarantor subsidiary’s creditors, including trade creditors, banks and
other lenders. Consequently, any claim by us or our creditors, including holders of the Notes, against a non-guarantor subsidiary will
be structurally subordinated to all of the claims of the creditors of such non-guarantor subsidiary.

**_Fraudulent conveyance laws may limit your rights as a holder of Notes._**

Although laws differ among various jurisdictions, in general, under fraudulent conveyance laws, a court could subordinate or void
a Guarantee if it found that:

   - the Guarantee was incurred with actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud creditors or shareholders of the Guarantor; or

   - the Guarantor did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value for the Guarantee and the Guarantor:

  - was insolvent or was rendered insolvent because of the Guarantee;

  - was undercapitalized or became undercapitalized because of the Guarantee; or

  - intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, debts beyond its ability to pay at maturity.

In addition, the measure of insolvency for purposes of fraudulent conveyance laws varies depending on the law applied. Generally,
however, a Guarantor would be considered insolvent if it could not pay its debts as they become due. If a court decided that any
Guarantee was a fraudulent conveyance and voided such Guarantee, or held it unenforceable for any other reason, you would cease to
have any claim in respect of the Guarantor of such Guarantee and would be a creditor solely of Lecta S.A. and the remaining
Guarantors.

For example, if Cartiere del Garda S.p.A. (the “Italian Guarantor”) which is organized under the laws of Italy becomes subject to a
bankruptcy proceeding pursuant to Italian Royal Decree No. 267 of March 16, 1942 (the “Italian Bankruptcy Law”) as amended by
Legislative Decree No. 5 of January 9, 2006 (the “Bankruptcy Law Reform”), New Extraordinary Administration pursuant to Law No.
39 of February 18, 2004, as amended, or, in certain circumstances, Prodi-bis Extraordinary Administration pursuant to Legislative
Decree No. 270 of July, 1999, payments or the granting of security interests made by the Italian Guarantor prior to the commencement
of the relevant proceeding may be subject to claw-back by the relevant trustee (revocatoria fallimentare) if (i) the payment or
guarantee is made within a period of six months prior to the commencement of the abovementioned procedure and (ii) the holder of
the Secured or Unsecured Note or the trustee under the Secured Indenture or Unsecured Indenture, as the case may be, in whose favor
the payment or guarantee was made was aware or should have been aware that the Italian Guarantor was insolvent at the time the
payment or guarantee was made and the relevant bankruptcy trustee is able to prove it. In addition, payments or the granting of
security interests made by the Italian Guarantor prior to the commencement of the relevant proceeding may be subject to claw-back by
the Secured Notes Trustee or Unsecured Notes Trustee, as applicable, if (i) in the year prior to the commencement of such bankruptcy
procedure, (A) such payments made or obligations assumed by it were higher by more than 25% of what was received or promised to
be received by the Italian Guarantor, (B) such payments were made without using normal means of payment; (C) the Italian Guarantor
voluntarily grated pledges, mortgages or other security to secure debts not yet matured or due (or in the six-month period prior to the
commencement of such bankruptcy proceeding the Italian Guarantor voluntarily granted pledges, mortgages or other security to

41


-----

secure debts already due) and (ii) the holder of the Note or the Secured Notes Trustee or Unsecured Notes Trustee, as applicable, is
unable to prove that it was not aware that the Italian Guarantor was insolvent. Pursuant to the Bankruptcy Law Reform, no claw-back
action may be brought (i) after a period of three years from the declaration of an Italian guarantor’s bankruptcy or (ii) after five years
from the date on which the relevant payment or guarantee was made.

Furthermore, Article 2901 of the Italian Civil Code provides for a general claw-back action (revocatoria ordinaria) applicable to
certain acts and transactions made by a debtor during the five years prior to the declaration of bankruptcy, upon the occurrence of
certain conditions. The requirements of a revocatoria ordinaria are (i) damage to the interests of the creditors and (ii) knowledge of
both the debtor and the counterparty of the damage to the interests of the creditors.

**_Local insolvency laws may not be as favorable to you as U.S. bankruptcy laws or those insolvency laws of another jurisdiction with_**
**_which you may be more familiar._**

Lecta S.A. is incorporated in Luxembourg, and the Guarantors are organized under the laws of Luxembourg, Italy and Spain.
Certain of our subsidiaries with significant assets, Condat Holding S.A. and Condat S.A.S., which are not guaranteeing the Notes but
which are borrowing under Intercompany Loans and providing security for such Intercompany Loans, are organized under the laws of
France. The insolvency laws of some or all of these other jurisdictions may not be as favorable to holders of the Notes as the laws of
the United States or some other jurisdictions. Moreover, there may be a risk that an Intercompany Loan may be equitably subordinated
to the claims of the trade creditors of the obligor under such Intercompany Loan upon the bankruptcy of such obligor. Payments made
under an equitably subordinated loan preceding the bankruptcy of an obligor may in certain circumstances be clawed back.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of insolvency law in the European Union, Luxembourg, Italy, France and
Spain. In the event that any one or more of Lecta S.A., the Guarantors or any other of our subsidiaries experience financial difficulty,
it is not possible to know with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced,
or the outcome of such proceedings.

_European Union Insolvency Law_

Pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) no. 1346/2000 on insolvency proceedings (the “EU Insolvency Regulation”), the court which
shall have jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings in relation to Lecta S.A. or any Guarantor will be the court of the Member State
where the entity concerned has its “centre of main interests” (as that term is used in Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation).
The determination of where Lecta S.A. or any Guarantor has its “centre of main interests” would be a question of fact on which the
courts of the different EU Member States may have differing and even conflicting views. It should also be noted that no final
decisions have been taken in cases that have been brought before the European Court of Justice in relation to questions of
interpretation or the effects of the EU Insolvency Regulation throughout the European Union. Furthermore, “centre of main interests”
is not a static concept and may change from time to time. Although under Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation there is a
rebuttable presumption that Lecta S.A. or a Guarantor would have its “centre of main interests” in the Member State in which it has its
registered office, Preamble 13 of the EU Insolvency Regulation states that the “centre of main interests” of a debtor should correspond
to the place where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and “is therefore ascertainable by third
parties.” In that respect, factors such as the place in which Lecta S.A. or a Guarantor holds board meetings, the place where Lecta S.A.
or a Guarantor conducts the majority of its business and the place where the large majority of Lecta S.A.’s or a Guarantor’s creditors
are established may all be relevant in the determination of the place where Lecta S.A. or a Guarantor has its “centre of main interests.”

If the “centre of main interests” of Lecta S.A. or a Guarantor is and will remain located in the state in which it has its registered
office, the main insolvency proceedings in respect of Lecta S.A. or a Guarantor under the EU Insolvency Regulation would be
commenced in such jurisdiction and accordingly a court in such jurisdiction would be entitled to commence the types of insolvency
proceedings referred to in Annex A to the EU Insolvency Regulation. Insolvency proceedings opened in one Member State under the
EU Insolvency Regulation are to be recognized in other Member States (other than Denmark), although secondary proceedings may
be opened in another Member State. If the “centre of main interests” of a debtor is in one Member State (other than Denmark) under
Article 3(2) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another Member State (other than Denmark) may open “territorial
proceedings” in the event that such debtor has an “establishment” in the territory of such other Member State. If a debtor does not
have an establishment in any other Member State, no court of any other Member State shall have the ability to open territorial
proceedings in respect of such debtor under the EU Insolvency Regulation.

_Luxembourg Insolvency Law_

Under Luxembourg law, the following types of proceedings (together referred to as insolvency proceedings) may be opened
against an entity having its registered office or center of principal interests in Luxembourg:

   - bankruptcy proceedings (faillite), the opening of which may be requested by the company or by any of its creditors.
Following such a request, the courts having jurisdiction may open bankruptcy proceedings if the company (i) is in a state of
cessation of payments (cessation des paiements) and cumulatively (ii) has lost its commercial creditworthiness. If a court finds
that these conditions are satisfied, it may also open bankruptcy proceedings ex officio (absent a request made by the company
or a creditor). The main effect of such proceedings is the suspension of all measures of enforcement against the company,
except, subject to certain limited exceptions, only for secured creditors and the payment of the creditors in accordance with
their rank upon realization of the assets;

   - controlled management proceedings (gestion contrôlée), the opening of which may only be requested by the company and not
by its creditors;

   - composition proceedings (concordat préventif de faillite), which may be requested only by the company and not by its
creditors. The court’s decision to admit a company to composition proceedings triggers a provisional stay on enforcement of
claims by creditors;

   - stay on payments (sursis de paiements) or to put the Issuer into judicial liquidation (liquidation judiciaire); and

   - judicial liquidation proceedings may be opened at the request of the public prosecutor against companies pursuing an activity
violating criminal laws or that are in violation of the commercial code or of the laws governing commercial companies. The
management of such liquidation proceedings will generally follow the rules of bankruptcy proceedings.

The Issuer’s liabilities in respect of the Notes will, in the event of a liquidation of the Issuer following, in particular, bankruptcy or
judicial liquidation proceedings, only rank after the cost of liquidation (including any debt incurred for the purpose of such
liquidation) and those of the Issuer’s debts that are entitled to priority under Luxembourg law. Preferential debts under Luxembourg
law include inter alia:

   - money owed to Luxembourg tax authorities in respect of, for example, income tax deducted at source or value added tax and
other taxes and duties;

   - social security contributions; and

   - remuneration owed to employees.

Assets over which a security interest has been granted will in principle not be available for distribution to unsecured creditors
(except after enforcement and to the extent a surplus is realized).

During such insolvency proceedings, all enforcement measures by unsecured creditors are suspended. The ability of secured
creditors to enforce their security interests may also be limited (particularly in the event of controlled management proceedings
providing expressly that the rights of secured creditors are frozen until a final decision has been taken by the court as to the petition for
controlled management) and may be affected thereafter by any reorganization order given by the court.

Furthermore, declarations of default and subsequent acceleration (such as acceleration upon the occurrence of an event of default)
are not enforceable during controlled management proceedings.

Luxembourg insolvency laws may affect transactions entered into or payments made by the Issuer during the period before any
liquidation or administration. If the liquidator or administrator can demonstrate that a payment was made during the “suspect period”
(which is a maximum of six months and ten days preceding the judgment declaring bankruptcy) that is disadvantageous to the estate
of creditors and the party receiving such payment is shown to have known that the bankrupt party had generally stopped making
payments when such payment occurred, a Luxembourg court has the power, among other things, to void the preferential transaction.

43


-----

If the liquidator or administrator can demonstrate that the Issuer has given “preference” to any person by defrauding the rights of
creditors generally, regardless of when this fraud occurred, a Luxembourg court has the power, among other things, to void the
preferential transaction.

Finally, any international aspects of Luxembourg bankruptcy, controlled management and composition proceedings may be
subject to the EU Insolvency Law. See “—European Union Insolvency Law.”

_Italian Insolvency Law_

The Italian Guarantor is subject to Italian laws governing creditors’ rights and bankruptcy, insolvency and restructuring
proceedings. In general, these Italian laws are considered to be more favorable to debtors and to the trustee in bankruptcy than the
regimes of certain other jurisdictions, including the United States. Moreover, the enforcement of security interests by creditors in Italy
can be time-consuming and expensive.

Under Italian insolvency law, a company must be declared insolvent by a court. Insolvency occurs when a debtor is no longer able
to regularly meet its obligations as and when they become due on a permanent, rather than temporary, basis. The following
restructuring and bankruptcy alternatives are available under Italian law for companies facing financial difficulties:

   - _Pre-Bankruptcy Composition pursuant to the Italian Bankruptcy Law. A company facing a financial crisis has the option to_
seek an arrangement with its creditors, under court supervision. During the Pre-Bankruptcy Composition, all actions by
creditors are stayed and the company is managed under the supervision of a court-appointed official; extraordinary transactions
must be authorized by the court. The Pre-Bankruptcy Composition proposal may provide for any or all of: (i) the division of
creditors into different classes; (ii) the differential treatment of creditors in different classes; (iii) a restructuring of the subject
company’s debt in any form, including a debt-for-equity exchange; and (iv) the transfer of the subject company’s assets to an
assignor (which may be one or more of the company’s creditors, or a corporation specifically established during the procedure
for the purpose of offering its shares to the creditors pursuant to the Pre-Bankruptcy Composition). The feasibility of the
composition arrangement must be confirmed by an expert’s report. The Pre-Bankruptcy Composition proposal must be
approved by unsecured creditors holding a majority (by value) of the claims recognized as having the right to vote by the courtappointed official (or, in the case of disputed claims, by the court on a provisional basis), or, if unsecured creditors are divided
into classes, by creditors holding a majority (by value) of the recognized claims in each class, and must be ratified by the court.
Once approved by creditors, and ratified by the court, the Pre-Bankruptcy Composition is binding on all creditors. If the PreBankruptcy Composition fails, the company, if found insolvent, is declared bankrupt by the court.

   - _New Extraordinary Administration pursuant to Law No. 39 of February 18, 2004, as amended. A company in a state of_
economic and financial crisis may be admitted to the New Extraordinary Administration if it (i) has had at least 500 employees
for at least one year and (ii) has indebtedness, including obligations arising from guarantees, in an aggregate amount of at least
€300 million. During such proceeding, which provides for a two-year restructuring plan, actions by creditors generally are
stayed, and the company is managed by an extraordinary trustee, appointed by the Italian Minister of Production Activities.
The restructuring plan may include a composition proposal providing for all or any of the options discussed above with regard
to the Pre-Bankruptcy Composition. Again, the proposal must be approved by creditors holding a majority (by value) of the
process claims, or, if creditors are divided into classes, by creditors holding a majority (by value) of the recognized claims in
each class, and must be ratified by the court. If the proposal is rejected, the extraordinary trustee may implement a divestiture
plan. If the divestiture plan can not be successfully carried out, the company is declared bankrupt by the court. In addition, at
any time during the proceeding, the court may convert the proceeding into a Bankruptcy Proceeding if it determines that the
New Extraordinary Administration is no longer useful.

   - _Prodi-bis Extraordinary Administration pursuant to Legislative Decree No. 270 of July, 1999. A company in a state of_
economic and financial crisis having (i) more than 200 employees for at least one year and (ii) aggregate indebtedness of not
less than two-thirds of its assets and of its annual revenues from sales and services, may be admitted to Prodi-bis Extraordinary
Administration, which provides for a one-year divestiture plan or a two-year restructuring plan. At any time during the
proceeding, the court may convert the proceeding into a bankruptcy proceeding if it determines that the Prodi-bis Extraordinary
Administration process is no longer useful.

44


-----

   - _Bankruptcy Proceeding (fallimento) pursuant to the Italian Bankruptcy Law._ The debtor, a creditor or a public prosecutor
may apply to an insolvency court for the commencement of the Bankruptcy Proceeding. Once begun, all actions of creditors
generally are stayed, and creditors are required to file claims with the court. The company is managed by a court-appointed
bankruptcy trustee, and any action taken by the debtor with respect to a creditor after a declaration of bankruptcy is ineffective.
The proceeds from the liquidation are distributed in accordance with statutory priority provisions regarding the payment of
certain preferred creditors, including employees, the Italian tax authorities and social security administrators. The Bankruptcy
Law Reform has simplified and shortened the bankruptcy proceedings and has increased the powers of the statutory creditors’
committee, which, among other things, is in charge of authorizing any extraordinary administration transaction to be carried
out by the bankruptcy trustee in managing the bankrupt estate.

   - _Post-bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato fallimentare) (the “Post-Bankruptcy Composition”) pursuant to the_
_Italian Bankruptcy Law. The Bankruptcy Proceeding can be terminated prior to liquidation by a debtor filing a petition with the_
insolvency court for a post-bankruptcy arrangement with creditors. The Post-Bankruptcy Composition has been amended by
the Bankruptcy Law Reform, and it now mirrors the Pre-Bankruptcy Composition in several respects, including the possibility
to propose a similar restructuring plan. Approval of the Post-Bankruptcy Composition proposal is governed by provisions
substantially similar to those of the Pre-Bankruptcy Composition. Once approved by creditors, and ratified by the court, the
Post-Bankruptcy Composition is binding on all creditors. If the Post-bankruptcy Composition fails, the bankruptcy proceeding
is reopened.

_Out-of-court restructurings. A new procedure permitting a debtor to file a petition with the court for the ratification and_
enforcement of an out-of-court-restructuring has been introduced by Law Decree No. 35 of March 14, 2005, enacted as Law No. 80 of
May 14, 2005. Such petition may be filed only if (i) creditors holding at least 60% of the subject company’s outstanding debt have
agreed to the proposed restructuring, and (ii) an expert’s report ensuring the feasibility of the restructuring (including the regular
payment of creditors who have not agreed to the proposed restructuring) is also filed with the court. Creditors and interested third
parties may oppose the restructuring within 30 days of the publication of the petition in the Companies’ Register. Once the court has
ruled on any such opposition, it can ratify the out-of-court restructuring.

_Statutory priorities. The highest priority claims (after payment of the costs of the proceeding) are the claims of preferential_
creditors, which include the claims of the Italian tax authorities and social security administrators and claims for employee wages.
Secured creditors are repaid next, and payment of unsecured creditors follows.

_French Insolvency Law_

_General right to petition for debt rescheduling. Pursuant to article 1244-1 of the French Civil Code (Code Civil), French courts_
may order the deferral or otherwise reschedule over a maximum period of two years the payment obligations of the debtor. In
addition, pursuant to article 1244-1, French courts may order that any such deferred or rescheduled amounts bear interest at a lower
rate than the contractual rate (yet not lower than the minimum statutory rate) and/or that payments be first allocated to the repayment
of the principal rather than interest. A court order rendered under article 1244-1 of the French Civil code in respect of one or more
creditors will automatically suspend any pending enforcement proceedings initiated by such creditors against the debtor, and any
contractual penalties for late payment will not accrue or be due during the period set by the court.

_Insolvency. Under French law, a company is considered insolvent (cessation des paiements) when it is unable to pay its current_
debts with its immediately available assets. French law distinguishes between pre- insolvency proceedings and insolvency
proceedings.

_Pre-insolvency proceedings_

   - Emergency procedure: The statutory auditors of the company can request the management and the board of directors to
provide an explanation as to elements which the auditors believe put the company’s existence as a going concern in jeopardy.
Failing satisfactory explanations or corrective measures, the auditors can request that a shareholders’ meeting be convened.
The auditors must inform the Commercial Court. Shareholders representing at least 5% of the share capital and the workers’
committee have similar rights. The Commercial Court can also itself summon the management to provide explanations on
elements which the court believe put the company’s existence as a going concern in jeopardy.

45


-----

   - Conciliation: A company that faces actual or foreseeable difficulties of a legal, economic or financial nature and which is not
already insolvent, can petition the Commercial Court for the appointment of a conciliator in charge of supervising and
facilitating a rescheduling agreement. Conciliation proceedings may last up to five months. During the proceedings, creditors
may continue to sue individually for payment of their debts, but cannot initiate insolvency proceedings. In addition, the
company retains the right to petition for debt rescheduling pursuant to article 1244-1 as described above. The conciliation
agreement is either:

   - ratified by the Commercial Court if the company is not insolvent at the time. The agreement effectively ensures that the
company will survive as a going concern and the agreement does not infringe upon the rights of the non-signatory creditors.
The agreement is then made public and any individual proceedings by creditors are suspended. In case of breach of the
agreement, any party can petition the court for its rescission; or

   - acknowledged by the court, which makes it binding upon its parties without suspending third party proceedings.

_Insolvency proceedings. Insolvency proceedings can be initiated by the company, which has an obligation to declare its_
insolvency within 45 days, its creditors, the Government or the Commercial Court.

Upon the opening of insolvency proceedings, the court can:

   - if the company is not yet insolvent, initiate a safeguard procedure (procédure de sauvegarde), which can only be initiated at
the request of the company;

   - if the company is insolvent but can be salvaged, initiate a reorganization procedure (redressement judiciaire); or

   - if the company is irremediably bankrupt, decide its liquidation.

During the safeguard or reorganization procedure (the “observation period”), individual proceedings by creditors are suspended
and the court appointed trustee decides which contracts the company will continue to execute and which ones are terminated or
suspended. Clauses providing for the termination of a contract or acceleration of the company’s obligations upon insolvency are
therefore not enforceable under French law. Parties to a contract that has been suspended or terminated by the trustee can sue for
damages, which will be apportioned at the end of the proceedings. No debt which was already due before the opening of the
insolvency proceedings can be paid by the company. The observation period can last up to six months and can be extended by court
decision. The court can decide to entrust the entire management of the company to the trustee or to give him or her a supervisory role.
In any case, all non-ordinary course of business decisions must be approved by the court.

At the end of the observation period, if it considers that the company can survive as a going concern, the court will adopt a
safeguard or reorganization plan which may entail the divesture of assets of the company or the sale of the entire company to new
shareholders. The court can decide to accelerate certain debts, to cancel others, that some debts will be reimbursed, including only
partially, with the proceeds of the sale of the assets of the company or of the entire company, or to reschedule surviving debts. If the
company cannot be salvaged, the court will decide its liquidation.

_Creditors’ Rights during Insolvency Proceedings. Creditors are represented in the proceedings by a representative appointed by_
the court.

As a general rule, creditors domiciled in France whose debts arose prior to the commencement of insolvency proceedings must file
a claim with the creditors’ representative within two months of the publication of the court order in the Official Bulletin of Civil and
Commercial Announcements (Bulletin officiel des annonces civiles et commerciales); this period is extended to four months for
creditors domiciled outside of France. Creditors who have not submitted their claims during the relevant period are barred from
receiving distributions made in connection with the insolvency proceedings and their unasserted claims are extinguished.

The date on which the debtor becomes insolvent (date de cessation des paiements) is deemed to be the date of the court order
commencing the insolvency proceedings. However, in this or a subsequent order, the court may set the date of insolvency at an earlier
date, up to 18 months prior to the court order commencing the proceedings. The date of insolvency marks the beginning of the suspect
period (période suspecte), during which transactions entered into by the debtor are, by law, void or voidable.

46


-----

Void transactions include:

   - transfers of assets for no consideration;

   - contracts under which the obligations of the debtor significantly exceed those of the other party;

   - payments of debts not due at the time of payment;

   - payments made in a manner which is not commonly used in the ordinary course of business;

   - security interests granted for debts previously incurred; and

   - conservatory measures, unless the right of attachment or seizure predates the date of insolvency.

Voidable transactions include:

   - transfers of assets for no consideration which took place during the six months preceding the date of insolvency;

   - transactions or payments made when due after the date of insolvency if the party dealing with the debtor knew of the
insolvency; and

   - notices made to third parties (avis à tiers détenteur), seizures (saisie-attribution) and oppositions made after the date of
insolvency, if the creditor knew of the insolvency.

As indicated above, from the date of the court order commencing the insolvency proceedings, the company is prohibited from
paying outstanding debts due prior to this date, subject to specified exceptions which essentially cover the set-off of related debts and
payments, authorized by the bankruptcy judge, made to recover assets for which recovery is justified by the continued operation of the
business. During this period, creditors may not pursue any individual legal action against the debtor with respect to any claim arising
prior to the court order commencing the bankruptcy proceedings if the objective of such legal action is:

   - to obtain an order for or payment of a sum of money by the debtor to the creditor (however, the creditor may require that a
court determine the amount due);

   - to terminate or cancel a contract for non-payment of amounts owed by the creditor; or

   - to enforce the creditor’s rights against any assets of the debtor.

French bankruptcy law assigns priority to the payment of certain preferential creditors, including employees, the court, officials
appointed by the court, creditors whose debts arose after the commencement of the insolvency proceedings, certain secured creditors
and the French Treasury.

_Spanish Insolvency Law_

Under the current Spanish Insolvency Law, a debtor is considered insolvent when it cannot possibly comply with its due
obligations on a regular basis. To be considered insolvent, the debtor, any creditor thereof or any other interested third party must file
a petition for insolvency within two months of the date when such petitioner becomes aware, or should have become aware, of the
debtor’s insolvency. If filed by the debtor, the insolvency is deemed “voluntary” (concurso voluntario) and, if filed by a third party,
the insolvency is deemed “mandatory” (concurso necesario). In the case of voluntary insolvency, as a general rule, the debtor retains
the management and full powers of disposal over its assets, although it is subject to the intervention (intervención) of the insolvency
administrators. In the case of mandatory insolvency, as a general rule, the debtor’s management powers are suspended, and
management’s former power, including the power to dispose of assets, is conferred solely upon the insolvency administrators.

47


-----

Under the current Spanish Insolvency Law, upon declaration of insolvency, acts detrimental (perjudiciales) to the debtor’s estate
carried out during the two years prior to the date the insolvency is declared may be rescinded, regardless of fraudulent intention.
Article 71 contains an irrefutable presumption that those acts where no consideration is received for a disposed asset and acts which
result in the early repayment of obligations which would have become due after the declaration of insolvency are detrimental. In
addition, unless the debtor or another affected party (such as a creditor) can prove otherwise to the court’s satisfaction, a disposal
made in favor of a related person or entity (as defined in the Spanish Insolvency Law) as well as the creation of a security interest
securing a pre-existing obligation or a new obligation that replaces an existing one, are presumed to be detrimental. In the case of
actions not covered by the presumptions above, the burden of proof is on the person bringing the action of rescission. Acts deriving
from the debtor’s ordinary course of business made at arm’s length may not be rescinded. Accordingly, a Guarantor’s acts of disposal
with a “related person or entity,” as defined in the Spanish Insolvency Law, (such as the Issuer) are presumed to be detrimental unless
proved otherwise. Also, the general principle of “No termination effect” is established such that all agreements remain effective at the
time of the insolvency.

Creditors may join more than one set of insolvency proceedings together, or apply for a joint insolvency order for various entities
if the debtor belongs to a group of companies with joint decision making powers and joint assets. In any event, and in particular in
joint insolvency proceedings, set-off is prohibited unless the requirements for the set-off were satisfied prior to the declaration of
insolvency or the set-off provisions are pursuant to an agreement subject to a law that permits set-off.

The current Spanish Insolvency Law also makes a distinction between general debts under insolvency proceedings and debts
against the insolvency estate. Debts against the insolvency estate, such as certain amounts of the employee payroll and costs and
expenses of the insolvency proceedings, are not considered part of the debtor’s general debt and are paid before other debts under
insolvency proceedings and at their respective maturities. The following is the order in which creditor’s claims are ranked:

   - claims against the insolvency estate, including, among others, claims for salaries relating to the 30 days prior to the
declaration of insolvency in an amount that does not exceed twice the Spanish minimum statutory salary (salario mínimo
_interprofesional), as well as claims for salaries and credits that result from obligations validly incurred during the insolvency_
proceeding by the insolvent party;

   - credits with a special privilege, including, among others, those holding claims secured by a legal or voluntary mortgage,
moveable mortgage or pledge without displacement of possession over the mortgaged or pledged assets; claims secured by
securities; and claims secured by a possessory pledge executed in a public document over the goods or rights in possession of
the creditor or a third party. In these cases, the privilege extends only to the secured asset;

   - credits with a general privilege, including claims for salaries that do not have a special privilege, severance payments and
indemnities for the termination of employment agreements, indemnities owed for labor accidents or sickness and surcharges on
dues owed for unpaid labor health duties accrued prior to the declaration of insolvency; amounts relating to unpaid withholding
taxes, and social security contributions up to 50% of the aggregate amount; claims for non-contractual liabilities; and up to
25% of the aggregate amount of the unsubordinated claims of the creditor that has requested the insolvency declaration;

   - credits (other than subordinated credits) not classified in any of the above categories will rank pari passu and be paid pro rata;
and

   - subordinated credits, including, among others, (i) late or incorrect claims, (ii) contractually subordinated claims, (iii) interest
(such as accrued and unpaid interest due on the Notes at the commencement of the insolvency proceeding (concurso), (iv)
fines, (v) claims of creditors which are related to the insolvent party and (v) detrimental claims against the insolvent party
where a Spanish court has determined that a relevant creditor has acted in bad faith (rescisión concursal), shall be paid in the
above mentioned order and pro rata within each class.

A “related person or entity,” under Spanish Insolvency Law, includes shareholders with more than 10% of the insolvent party’s
capital (5% if it is a listed company), the administrators or directors of the insolvent party (including the insolvent company’s directors
and administrators in the two years preceding the insolvency), members of the same group of companies and any assignee or acquirer
of credits held by the aforementioned persons and entities transferred in the two years preceding the insolvency.

_Applicable jurisdiction_

The applicable jurisdiction to conduct an insolvency proceeding is the one in which the insolvent party has its “center of principal
interests.” This center is deemed to be where the insolvent party conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and
which is recognized as such by third parties. Insolvency proceedings conducted by the court with jurisdiction over the center of
principal interests are considered “the principal insolvency proceedings” and have universal reach affecting all the assets of the
insolvent party worldwide. If the center of principal interests is not in Spain, but the insolvent party has a permanent establishment in
Spain, Spanish courts will only have jurisdiction over the assets located in Spain (the “territorial insolvency proceedings”).

In the event Spanish courts have jurisdiction (upon a judicial consideration that the Issuer’s center of principal interest is in Spain),
Article 87.6 of the current Spanish Insolvency Law would apply to the Issuer. Article 87.6 provides that creditors holding a third party
guarantee will be recognized in the insolvency proceeding in their full amount without any limitation and without prejudice to the
subrogation of the guarantor in the creditor’s place, if the guarantee is enforced. This Article also provides that both bondholders’ and
guarantor’s credits will be classified according to what is more beneficial for the insolvent debtor. The Guarantors’ credits against the
Issuer would be subordinated because they are related entities, as discussed above. Although there are no clear judicial precedents in
respect of this matter, under Article 87.6 a bondholder’s credits might be classified as subordinated, notwithstanding their original
qualification as ordinary credits, because the classification as subordinated (instead of ordinary credits) would be more beneficial to
the insolvent party.

In the event that any of the Guarantors becomes insolvent and is subject to the current Spanish insolvency law, its Guarantee will
be treated as ordinary debt. Under the current Spanish insolvency law, the funding loans between the Spanish Guarantors and the
Issuer would be treated as subordinated debt. In addition, creditors may seek repayment directly from the insolvent entity’s directors
or attorneys-in-fact if a court determines that the bankruptcy resulted from their negligence (concurso culpable), if some legal
requirements are met.

_Moratorium_

The current Spanish Insolvency Law imposes a moratorium on the enforcement of secured creditor’s rights in the event of
insolvency. The moratorium would take effect following the declaration of insolvency until the earlier of (i) one year from the
declaration of the insolvency if the insolvent company has not been placed in liquidation or (ii) the date the creditors reach an
agreement that does not affect the exercise of the rights granted by the security interest.

The current Spanish Insolvency Law only recently came into effect, and as such, there is only a limited history of its application by
Spanish courts.

**_Enforcing your rights as a holder of Notes or under the Guarantees across multiple jurisdictions may prove difficult._**

The Notes will be issued by Lecta S.A., which is organized under the laws of Luxembourg, and guaranteed by the Guarantors,
which are organized under the laws of Luxembourg, Italy or Spain, as the case may be. In the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency or
similar event, proceedings could be initiated in any or all of these jurisdictions. Such multi-jurisdictional proceedings are likely to be
complex and costly for creditors and may result in greater uncertainty and delay regarding the enforcement of your rights. Your rights
under the Notes and the Guarantees will potentially be subject to the insolvency and administrative laws of several jurisdictions, and
there can be no assurance that you will be able to effectively enforce your rights in such circumstances.

In addition, the bankruptcy, insolvency, administrative and other laws of the various Guarantors’ jurisdictions of organization may
be materially different from, or in conflict with, each other, including in the areas of rights of creditors, priority of government and
other creditors, ability to obtain post-petition interest and duration of the proceedings. The application of these laws, or any conflict
among them, could call into question whether any particular jurisdiction’s law should apply, could adversely affect your ability to
enforce your rights under the Notes and the Guarantees in these jurisdictions, and could limit any amounts that you may receive.

49


-----

**_We may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance a change of control offer if required by the terms and_**
**_conditions of the Notes._**

Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control as defined in the Secured Indenture and Unsecured Indenture as applicable, we will
be required to offer to repurchase all of the Notes in cash in an amount equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued
and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of repurchase. See “Description of the Secured Notes—Change of Control” and “Description of
the Unsecured Notes—Change of Control.” We may not have sufficient funds at the time of any such event to make the required
repurchases. Additionally, a Change of Control would be a prepayment event under the RCF. In the event this results in an event of
default thereunder, the lenders under the RCF may accelerate such debt, which could also cause an event of default under the
Indentures.

The source of funds for any repurchase required as a result of any such event will be available cash or cash generated from
operating activities or other sources, including borrowings, sales of assets, sales of equity or funds provided by subsidiaries. Sufficient
funds may not be available at the time of any such events to make any required repurchases of the Notes tendered.

**_You may be unable to enforce judgments against us, the Guarantors, or our or the Guarantors’ directors and officers._**

Neither Lecta S.A. nor any of the Guarantors are incorporated within the United States. In addition, all of the group’s assets are
outside the United States and all of the group’s directors and officers live outside the United States. Lecta S.A.’s and the Guarantors’
auditors are also organized outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult or impossible to serve process against any of these
persons in the United States. Furthermore, as all or substantially all of the assets of these persons are located outside of the United
States, it may not be possible to enforce judgments obtained in courts in the United States predicated upon civil liability provisions of
the federal securities laws of the United States against these persons. Additionally, there is doubt as to the enforceability in
Luxembourg, Italy or Spain of civil liabilities based on the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States. See
“Service of Process and Enforcement of Civil Liabilities.”

**_Our controlling shareholder may have interests which conflict with those of holders of Notes._**

Circumstances may occur in which the interests of our controlling shareholder could be in conflict with your interests. For
example, the interests of our controlling shareholder could conflict with your interests if we faced financial difficulties and were
unable to comply with our obligations to you under the Notes. In addition, our equity investors may have an interest in pursuing
acquisitions, divestitures and other transactions that, in their judgment, could enhance their equity investment, even though such
transactions might involve risks to you. Conversely, our controlling shareholders or our minority shareholders may have an interest in
not pursuing acquisitions, divestitures and other transactions that could enhance our cash flow and be beneficial to you. Moreover, our
controlling shareholder is in the business of making investments in companies and may, from time to time, acquire and hold interests
in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us.

**_Borrowings under the RCF and the Notes will bear interest at floating rates that could rise significantly, increasing our interest_**
**_cost and debt and reducing our cash flow._**

Borrowings under the RCF and the Notes will bear interest at per annum rates equal to EURIBOR, adjusted periodically, plus a
spread. These interest rates could rise significantly in the future, increasing our interest expense associated with these obligations and
thus our debt, reducing cash flow available for capital expenditures and hindering our ability to make payments on the Notes.

**_The EU Savings Directive may require withholdings._**

Under EC Council Directive 2003/48/EC on the taxation of savings income (the “EU Savings Directive”), EU member states are
required to provide to the tax authorities of another member state details of payments of interest (or similar income) paid by a person
within its jurisdiction to an individual resident in that other member state. However, for a transitional period, Belgium, Luxembourg
and Austria are instead required (unless during that period they elect otherwise) to operate a withholding system in relation to such
payments (the ending of such transitional period being dependent upon the conclusion of certain other agreements relating to
information exchanges with certain other countries). A number of non-EU countries and territories, including Switzerland, have
agreed to adopt similar measures (a withholding system in the case of Switzerland) with effect from the same date.

50


-----

If, following implementation of the EU Savings Directive, a payment were to be made or collected through a member state which
has opted for a withholding system and an amount of, or in respect of which, tax were to be withheld from that payment, neither Lecta
S.A. nor any Paying Agent nor any other person would be obliged to pay additional amounts with respect to any Note as a result of the
imposition of such withholding tax. If a withholding tax is imposed on payment made by a Paying Agent following implementation of
the EU Savings Directive, we will be required to maintain a Paying Agent in a member state that will not be obliged to withhold or
deduct tax pursuant to the EU Savings Directive.

**_If Spanish tax authorities determine that interest payments that any Spanish Guarantor makes should be treated as Spanish source_**
**_income, withholding rules could apply and we could be required to gross-up any such payments for the amount of any required_**
**_withholding._**

We have been advised that under applicable Spanish tax rules, all payments of principal and interest made under the Guarantees
should be made free and clear of any withholding or deduction of any taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges of any
nature whatsoever which may be imposed, levied, collected, withheld or assessed by the Kingdom of Spain or any political
subdivision or authority thereof or therein. Though there is no clear precedent, statement of law or regulation to support the position,
however, the Spanish tax authorities may determine that, under certain circumstances, payments by a Spanish Guarantor to holders of
Notes should be treated as Spanish source income subject to a 18% withholding tax on such payments.

If such withholding tax were imposed on any payments by any Spanish Guarantor, we would be required under the Indentures to
gross-up any such payments to cover the full amount of the taxes required to be withheld. The amounts we would be required to grossup could be substantial and could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

**_There is no public trading market for the Notes and the ability to transfer them is limited, both of which may adversely affect the_**
**_value of the Notes._**

The Notes are a new issue. There is no existing trading market for the Notes and there can be no assurance that a trading market
for the Notes will develop. We cannot predict the extent to which investor interest in our company will lead to the development of an
active trading market or how liquid that trading market might become. Although the Initial Purchasers have advised us that they intend
to make a market in the Notes, they are not obligated to do so and may stop at any time. The market price of our Notes may be
influenced by many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including:

   - changes in demand, supply or pricing of our products;

   - general economic conditions, including raw material prices;

   - the activities of competitors;

   - our quarterly or annual earnings or those of our competitors;

   - investor perceptions of us and the coated woodfree paper industry;

   - the failure of securities analysts to cover our Notes after this offering or changes in financial estimates by analysts;

   - the public’s reaction to our press releases or our other public announcements;

   - future sales of Notes; and

   - other factors described under “Risk Factors.”

As a result of these factors, you may not be able to resell your Notes at or above the initial offering price. In addition, securities
trading markets experience extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating
performance of a particular company. These broad market fluctuations and industry factors may materially reduce the market price of

51


-----

our Notes, regardless of our operating performance. If an active trading market does not develop, you may have difficulty selling any
Notes that you buy.

The Notes have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act or any United States securities laws and we have
not undertaken to effect any exchange offer for the Notes in the future. You may not offer the Notes for sale in the United States
except pursuant to an exemption from, or a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and
applicable state securities laws, or pursuant to an effective registration statement. The Notes and the Indentures will contain provisions
that will restrict the Notes from being offered, sold or otherwise transferred except pursuant to the exemptions available pursuant to
Rule 144A and Regulation S, or other exceptions, under the U.S. Securities Act. Furthermore, we have not registered the Notes under
any other country’s securities laws. It is your obligation to ensure that your offers and sales of the Notes within the United States and
other countries comply with applicable securities laws. See “Notice to Investors.” In addition, by its acceptance of delivery of any
Notes, the holder thereof agrees on its own behalf and on behalf of any investor accounts for which it has purchased notes that it shall
not transfer the Notes in an amount less than €50,000.

52


-----

**USE OF PROCEEDS**

We estimate that the net proceeds to us from the offering of the Notes after deducting the transaction fees and offering expenses
will be approximately €728.0 million. We will use the proceeds of the offering to repay in full our outstanding indebtedness under the
Existing Credit Facilities.

The Initial Purchasers and certain of their affiliates are lenders to us under the Existing Credit Facilities. As of September 30,
2006, the amount outstanding under our Existing Credit Facilities was €748.5 million, the weighted average maturity of which was 3.3
years and the weighted average interest rate of which was 5.361%.

__________

(1) Since September 30, 2006, we have made voluntary and mandatory prepayments of €22.9 million of debt incurred under the
Existing Credit Facilities. As of December 31, 2006, we had €725.6 million of debt outstanding under the Existing Credit
Facilities.

(2) Represents €748.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Notes offered hereby. For purposes of the above capitalization
table, debt consisting of the Notes is reflected at its principal amount. Under IFRS, however, debt issuance costs would be
deducted from the principal amount of the debt to which they relate for purposes of our balance sheet. Estimated financing
costs and issue discount related to the Refinancing are approximately €22.0 million, of which approximately €20.0 million are
attributable to the Notes and €2.0 million to the RCF.

(3) Represents €32.9 million of other indebtedness, as described in note 26 to our audited consolidated financial statements as of
and for the year ended December 31, 2005 included elsewhere in this listing memorandum, less €15.8 million of capitalized
debt issuance costs which will be written-off as a result of the Refinancing. As adjusted, reflects incremental debt issuance
costs of €6.2 million as a result of the Refinancing.

__________

(1) Revenues consist of sales of paper (including paper produced by third parties and sold through Torraspapel’s distribution
business) and energy.

(2) We define EBITDA as earnings before depreciation, amortization, unusual items, finance costs, net income from associates
and income tax. EBITDA includes non-cash expenses and income, consisting of variations in inventories and operating
provisions. EBITDA does not necessarily indicate whether cash flow will be sufficient or available for cash requirements and
may not be indicative of our results of operations. In addition, EBITDA as we define it may not be comparable to other
similarly titled measures used by other companies. Moreover, EBITDA as presented herein and in our financial statements is
not calculated in the same way as “EBITDA” is calculated under the Indentures and the RCF.

(3) Unusual items in 2005 included disposals of property, plant and equipment, ineffective portion in the variation of rate hedging
derivatives and other income and charges.

(4) Finance costs include interest on senior debt, rate hedging derivatives, amortization of issue costs on borrowings, senior debt
and other finance related expenses.

(5) Does not include an €88,788 exceptional tax credit received as a result of a change in Spanish tax regulations.

(6) We define total debt under IFRS as interest-bearing borrowings plus the current portion of interest-bearing borrowings, bank
overdrafts, loans and interest rate hedging receivables (payables) and under Luxembourg GAAP as borrowings.

(7) Total net debt represents total debt as defined above less cash and cash equivalents.

(8) Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents is calculated net of bank overdrafts.

(9) We define EBITDA here as we define it in footnote 2 above, and we repeat EBITDA here as a line item for convenience.

(10) EBITDA margin is calculated as the ratio of EBITDA to revenues.

(11) Capital expenditure represents the purchase of equipment for the purposes of cost reduction and productivity improvement,
maintenance, paper machine rebuilds, information technology and environment and safety.

(12) Pro forma net debt is derived by giving effect to the Refinancing as described under “Summary—The Refinancing” as if it had
occurred at the end of the period.

(13) Pro forma net cash interest expense reflects the estimated cash interest expense net of interest income that would have been
payable during the twelve months ended September 30, 2006 as adjusted to give effect to the Refinancing as if it had occurred at
the beginning of the period. For the avoidance of doubt, this number excludes the following non-cash items: amortization of
issue costs on borrowings (€2.7m), finance costs in the provisions on employee benefits (€1.1m) and other IFRS adjustments
(€0.2m). This number also excludes the following cash items: interest on rate hedging derivatives, which expired in June 2006
(€6.1m), and the cost of early payment discounts unrelated to interest-bearing borrowings (€11.8m). These non-cash and cash
items are included in the financial income (expense)/finance costs line item included in our income statement and are broken out
in note 11 to our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2005 included elsewhere in
this listing memorandum.

(14) Tons per employee is calculated as the ratio of metric tons of pulp and paper produced to the number of employees. Certain of
our employees included in the calculation are not involved in the paper production process.

**OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW**
**AND PROSPECTS**

_The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and the notes thereto included_
_elsewhere in this listing memorandum. We have prepared our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2005 in_
_accordance with IFRS. Our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2004 were prepared in accordance with both_
_Luxembourg GAAP and IFRS. The discussion contained herein is based on our audited IFRS financial statements and our unaudited_
_interim financial information for the nine months ended September 30, 2005 and 2006._

**Overview**

We are the largest coated woodfree paper manufacturer in Southern Europe (consisting primarily of Spain, Portugal, France and
Italy) and the third largest coated woodfree paper manufacturer in Europe, with an annual production capacity of 1,500,000 metric
tons. We are also one of the leading manufacturers of specialty papers in Europe, with an annual production capacity of 220,000
metric tons. In addition, we operate a 230,000 metric ton pulp mill in Spain, which provides approximately 30% of our overall pulp
requirements for all of our coated woodfree paper mills. We have ten coated woodfree paper machines and six specialty paper
machines in eleven mills located at various sites in Italy, France and Spain. In the year ended December 31, 2005, our mills produced
an aggregate of 1,359,100 metric tons of coated woodfree paper and 222,200 metric tons of specialty papers, including uncoated
paper, a type of specialty paper produced by our coated woodfree paper mills. We market our products principally in Spain, Portugal
and France, where we rank first by market share, in Italy, where we rank second by market share, and also in other European countries
and, to a lesser extent, outside of Europe. Our mills are located in close proximity to our key commercial printing markets in Spain,
Portugal, France and Italy, where approximately 35% of European commercial printing deliveries of coated woodfree paper are made
(9% in Spain, 1% in Portugal, 12% in France and 13% in Italy). During the year ended December 31, 2005, we had total sales of
€1,414.8 million and EBITDA of €183.0 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2006 and the twelve months ended
September 30, 2006, we had total sales of €1,075.0 million and €1,433.7 million, respectively, and EBITDA of €105.4 million and
€149.1 million, respectively.

The Lecta group was initially formed by CVC in 1997 to acquire Garda of Italy in October of that year, and it subsequently
acquired Condat of France in November 1998 and Torraspapel of Spain in December 1999, all three of which are long-established
paper manufacturing companies. Each of Garda, Condat and Torraspapel produces coated woodfree paper for sale under their own
brand names, which we believe are well-established in the European market. Torraspapel also produces a variety of specialty papers,
including thermal, metallized and self-adhesive papers. In addition, Torraspapel acts as a distributor of coated woodfree paper and
speciality papers in Spain, Portugal and France, and in the year ended December 31, 2005, Torraspapel distributed 430,000 metric tons
of paper, of which 82,500 metric tons were produced by third parties.

**Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations**

**_Cyclicality in the Paper Industry_**

Our results of operations have been affected significantly by cyclicality in the paper industry. Long-term demand for paper is
driven by global economic trends, demographic trends, technological developments and trends in end-user preferences. Although
historically consumption of paper by end-users has increased steadily, customer demand for paper has fluctuated significantly,
suggesting that customer demand is driven by a combination of end-user consumption and changes in the inventory levels that
customers maintain. Profitability in the paper industry is highly sensitive to changes in prices, and industry profit cycles reflect the
constantly shifting balance between supply and demand for individual products, as well as changes in inventory levels. Periods of
industry-wide investment in new production capacity or significant contractions in demand due to weak economic conditions have in
previous industry cycles led to decreases in product prices, often as a result of excess capacity. This cyclicality in the industry is
exacerbated by the customer practice of leveraging inventory capacity, pursuant to which customers aim to build inventories in
anticipation of increases in paper prices and then satisfy end-user demand from their inventories when paper prices are high. As a
result, the financial performance of the industry has historically deteriorated during periods of oversupply only to improve when either
demand has increased or supply has been reduced to a level that supports the implementation of price increases.

The European paper industry experienced a cyclical peak in 2000 and early 2001, as a result of which significant investments were
made in Europe to increase production capacity. The industry then experienced a downturn beginning in late 2001, which continued
through 2003, as lower demand resulted in oversupply, which exerted further downward pressure on paper prices. For European
producers, the continued weakening of the U.S. dollar and pound sterling against the euro aggravated the effects of decreased prices
by reducing the euro-equivalent selling prices for exports.

In 2004, for the first time since 2000, economic growth in Europe increased against the previous year, and the amount of money
spent on printed advertising, which tends to track economic growth, similarly increased in Western Europe, resulting in increased
demand for paper in 2004. However, the Western European market continued to be burdened by overcapacity. As a result, the
increased demand did not result in increased paper prices.

In 2005, economic growth slowed in Europe as compared to the previous year, and the growth in paper demand likewise slowed,
although it grew at a faster rate than the overall economy. Although growth in production capacity slowed and supply was reduced by
a labor dispute impacting Finnish paper producers, excess capacity continued and prices remained low.

In the first nine months of 2006, coated woodfree paper demand in Western Europe grew at a slightly lower rate than for the full
year 2005 and at a rate lower than the overall economic growth rate. In the first nine months of 2006, there were a number of closures
by our competitors which have resulted in lower overall production capacity in Europe. According to a Pöyry study, demand growth
for coated woodfree paper is expected to weaken in 2007, as is overall economic growth and spending on advertising. Demand may
also be affected by planned capacity expansions in Asia, which will result in reductions of exports by European producers to Asia.
Due to depressed profitability, some of our competitors have recently announced further European capacity reductions which we
believe will improve the supply/demand imbalance in Europe and contribute to improved price stabilization. According to the Pöyry
study, after giving effect to the announced shutdowns, but without taking into account capacity creep, European coated woodfree
paper production capacity is expected to decrease by 6% by the end of 2007, and current industry capacity utilization, which was 91%
in 2006, is expected to increase to 94% in 2007 and 98% in 2008. We believe that the European coated woodfree paper industry’s
pricing power historically has strengthened when capacity utilization has reached 95%.

In the longer term, the coated woodfree paper market in Europe may be impacted by further capacity expansion in Asia, which is
expected to be significant, and which would result in lower demand for European production as Asia is currently a net importer. In
addition, the European market may encounter greater import competition from Asia and potentially Latin America as well. Long-term
demand for coated woodfree paper may also be impacted by the growing use and acceptance of the internet.

**_Raw Materials Cost_**

Our primary raw materials costs are for pulp and energy. We purchase 70% of our pulp requirements, and in recent years, pulp
prices have been highly volatile and have significantly increased. The steep rise in the price of crude oil during 2005 increased oilbased raw materials and transportation costs. Due to overcapacity in the European paper market, we and our competitors have been

60


-----

unable to pass on increases in the prices of pulp, energy and other raw materials to our customers. As a result of fluctuations in our
raw materials costs, our financial results have varied significantly over time. We have experienced price increases for electricity, gas
and other raw materials, and we expect further cost increases throughout 2007. These price increases are expected to have a negative
impact on our results of operations for the fourth quarter of 2006 and at least the first quarter of 2007. A further substantial increase in
prices for these raw materials would significantly increase our production costs and, all other factors being equal, adversely affect our
margins, results of operations and cash flows.

Wood pulp is the principal raw material required to manufacture paper. The price of pulp is highly volatile and sensitive to
changes in industry capacity, producer inventories, demand for paper, cyclical changes in the world economy and fluctuations in the
U.S. dollar, the reference currency for trading. Fluctuations in pulp prices may impact, in turn, prices of final paper products.
Compared to many of our competitors, we are particularly susceptible to volatility in pulp prices because we have a lower degree of
vertical pulp integration and because we do not hedge against fluctuations in our raw materials costs.

According to Pöyry, in the beginning of 2004, increased demand and a weakening of the U.S. dollar resulted in increased pulp
prices. During late 2004 and the first half of 2005, oversupply of pulp and a strengthening of the U.S. dollar caused pulp prices to
decrease. However, prices increased significantly during the second half of 2005 and the first nine months of 2006, due to increased
demand as well as reductions in supply, which partially resulted from a labor dispute impacting Finnish pulp producers. According to
Pöyry, a further increase in pulp prices during the fourth quarter of 2006 is expected. However, Pöyry also indicates that despite
expected increases in demand, pulp prices will fall in 2007, as a result of an expansion in pulp production capacity, primarily in Latin
America.

**_Labor Costs_**

A significant portion of our operating costs are comprised of labor costs. Although we have achieved significant productivity
improvements (as measured by metric tons of pulp and paper produced per employee) and have reduced our average headcount from
4,827 employees during the year ended December 31, 2003 to 4,699 employees during the year ended December 31, 2006, our total
labor costs have increased marginally as a result of wage increases.

**_Cost-Savings Measures and Efficiency of Operations_**

Paper producers have a high proportion of fixed costs, and as a result, fluctuations in prices for paper products cause corresponding
fluctuations in the profitability of paper manufacturers. As pricing in the paper industry is highly competitive, paper producers must
focus on achieving greater efficiency and cost-control to improve their competitive positions. To that end, we have undertaken a
number of cost savings measures in recent years, such as investing in the modernization of our paper machines and sharing best
practices among our three operating subsidiaries to enhance the efficiency of our production. As a result of these measures, we have
increased our metric tons of pulp and paper produced per employee from 306 metric tons in 2001 to 392 metric tons in 2006. In
addition, as a means of reducing our energy costs, we intend to replace our existing cogeneration facility at our mill in Riva del Garda,
Italy with a new facility to be completed in 2008, and we estimate the new facility will improve Garda’s EBITDA by approximately
€10 million to €12 million per year. We intend to continue to implement measures to reduce our production costs and improve the
efficiency of our operations.

**_Effect of Currency Fluctuations_**

Our sales are denominated principally in euro and are also denominated in pounds sterling, Canadian dollars and other currencies.
Our principal raw material, pulp, is a commodity priced in U.S. dollars. Our other costs are predominantly denominated in euro.
Accordingly, we are net purchasers of U.S. dollars. As such, all other things being equal, a weakening of the U.S. dollar would have a
positive impact on our earnings. However, the U.S. dollar price of pulp and the euro price of paper are correlated to the U.S. dollar
such that a weakening of the U.S. dollar exerts downward pressure on euro paper prices and upward pressure on pulp prices. The
following table sets forth the depreciation of the average rates of the U.S. dollar against the average rates of the euro for the periods
indicated. The average rates in the table below represent the annual average of exchange rate changes calculated based on daily
closing rates in London as reported by Bloomberg.

Any further weakening of the U.S. dollar beyond current levels would have an adverse effect on our results of operations.

We have a policy of hedging our foreign exchange exposure on non-euro denominated sales and purchases once they are committed.
We generally do not hedge projected foreign exchange flows.
See “—Financial Risk Management—Foreign Exchange Risk.”

**Recent Developments**

**_Preliminary Fourth Quarter Results_**

Based on preliminary data, we estimate that volumes sold for the three months ended December 31, 2006 will be approximately
425,000 metric tons of paper, an increase of approximately 2.6%, from 414,000 metric tons of paper sold in the three months ended
December 31, 2005, and an increase of approximately 2.1% from 416,300 metric tons of paper sold in the three months ended
September 30, 2006.

We estimate that our EBITDA for the three months ended December 31, 2006 will be 20-25% lower than our EBITDA for the
three months ended December 31, 2005 of €43.7 million. This decrease in EBITDA relative to the fourth quarter of 2005 is
attributable to our significantly lower gross margins throughout 2006 primarily as a result of higher pulp energy and transportation and
costs, which we were unable to pass onto our customers due to continued industry overcapacity.

**_Industry Outlook_**

According to Pöyry, in 2007 demand for coated woodfree paper in Europe will increase by 1.6% for the year compared to 2.2% for
2006. Pöyry predicts that demand will grow at a slower pace during the first half of 2007 and will improve during the second half of
2007. Pöyry is expecting small price increases; however, an economic slowdown may force price decreases at the end of 2007.

Pöyry predicts demand in Europe for coated woodfree paper will grow by 2.3% to 3.6% per year between 2008 and 2010, based
on, among other things, an assumption that the economy will be stronger, and as a result, spending on advertising will increase. This
demand growth is predicted despite planned capacity expansions in Asia, which are largely expected to supply the Asian market and
may impact Asian demand for both reels and sheeted products produced in Europe. Pöyry anticipates that prices will increase during
the second half of 2008 by 2% to 3%.

Pöyry expects pulp prices to decline in the near term as a result of new pulp production capacity coming on-stream. According to
Pöyry, this increased pulp capacity will increase supply in the market between late 2006 and 2008, with a significant part of the
capacity growth in Latin America. Pöyry predicts that the average price of bleached hardwood kraft pulp will decline by 10.6% during
2007 as a result of this increased supply.

_Revenues_

Our revenues increased by €18.9 million, or 1.8%, to €1,075.0 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2006 from
€1,056.2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2005. This increase was attributable to the effects of an increase in sales
volumes of 18,600 metric tons, increasing to 1,246,900 metric tons in the nine months ended September 30, 2006 from 1,228,300
metric tons in the nine months ended September 30, 2005. Average selling prices in the nine months ended September 30, 2006
largely remained flat at €846 per metric ton compared to €844 per metric ton for the nine months ended September 30, 2005.

_Raw Materials and Consumables Used_

These costs are principally comprised of pulp costs, minerals and chemicals costs, wood costs and cost of goods sold for products
purchased from third parties that Torraspapel sells through its distribution business. The costs of raw materials and consumables used
increased by €27.9 million, or 6.0%, to €491.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2006 from €463.9 million in the nine
months ended September 30, 2005, and, as a percentage of revenues, they increased from 43.9% in the nine months ended September
30, 2005 to 45.7% in the nine months ended September 30, 2006. The absolute increase was primarily attributable to the higher price
of pulp, which increased by €46 per ton, to €432 per ton in the nine months ended September 30, 2006 from €386 per ton in the nine
months ended September 30, 2005, as well as to slightly higher production volumes.

-----

_Labor Costs_

Labor costs increased by €4.5 million, or 2.6%, to €180.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2006 from €176.1
million in the nine months ended September 30, 2005, and as a percentage of revenues, they increased from 16.7% in the nine months
ended September 30, 2005 to 16.8% in the nine months ended September 30, 2006. The absolute increase was primarily attributable to
wage increases partially offset by a reduction in average headcount of 52 employees, which decreased average headcount to 4,700
employees in the nine months ended September 30, 2006 from 4,752 employees in the nine months ended September 30, 2005.

_Other Operating Costs Except Unusual Items_

Other operating costs except unusual items are principally comprised of energy costs, transportation costs and selling, general and
administrative expenses. Other operating costs except unusual items increased by €21.5 million, or 7.4%, to €311.2 million in the nine
months ended September 30, 2006 from €289.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2005, and as a percentage of
revenues, they increased from 27.4% in the nine months ended September 30, 2005, to 28.9% in the nine months ended September 30,
2006. The absolute increase was primarily attributable to higher energy costs of €21.9 million, which were partially offset by our
reduced consumption of energy as compared to the previous period, due to implementation of our Lecta Energy Monitoring System,
and higher transportation costs, which increased by €3.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2006 compared to the nine
months ended September 30, 2005.

_EBITDA_

EBITDA decreased by €33.9 million, or 24.3%, to €105.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2006 from €139.3
million in the nine months ended September 30, 2005. This decrease was attributable to lower gross margins, due to static paper
selling prices coupled with the higher cost of pulp, as well as higher energy and transportation costs. Historically, Garda and
Torraspapel each generate significantly higher EBITDA margins than Condat, which produces a higher ratio of lower-margin reels to
sheets and has higher transportation costs due to a greater number of exported products. For the nine months ended September 30,
2006 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2005, each of our companies’ EBITDA margins declined by a similar
amount as a result of the challenging operating conditions in the industry discussed above.

_Depreciation and Amortization_

Depreciation and amortization increased by €0.3 million, or 0.5%, to €63 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2006
from €62.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2005.

_Unusual Items_

In the nine months ended September 30, 2006, we recorded an unusual loss of €4.4 million primarily relating to the release of
goodwill following the accounting of deferred tax assets on former tax losses. In the nine months ended September 30, 2005, we
recorded an unusual loss of €0.6 million relating to the disposal of fixed assets.

_Finance Costs_

Finance costs increased by €1.2 million, or 2.6%, to €47.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2006 from €46.0
million in the nine months ended September 30, 2005. This increase was primarily due to higher average interest rates on our
borrowings, which was partially offset by lower debt balances.

_Income Taxes_

In the nine months ended September 30, 2006, we recorded a profit on income tax of €21.8 million, due primarily to the
capitalization of deferred income tax losses. In the nine months ended September 30, 2005, we recorded income taxes of €10.7 million
on our profits before tax.

**Profit after tax** ................................................... **16.2** **1.2** **18.8** **1.3** **+15.9**

_Revenues_

Our revenues increased by €59.6 million, or 4.4%, to €1,414.8 million in 2005 from €1,355.2 million in 2004. This increase was
primarily attributable to the effects of higher sales volumes of 65,500 metric tons, increasing to 1,642,300 metric tons in 2005 from
1,576,800 metric tons in 2004. Average selling prices largely remained flat at €845 per metric ton in 2005 compared to €844 per
metric ton in 2004.

_Raw Materials and Consumables Used_

The costs of raw materials and consumables used increased by €36.6 million, or 6.3%, to €617.0 million in 2005 from €580.4
million in 2004 and, as a percentage of revenues, they increased from 42.8% in 2004 to 43.6% in 2005. The absolute increase was
primarily attributable to higher production volumes, which increased by 5.4%. The average purchase price of pulp increased slightly
to €393 per ton in 2005 from €390 per ton in 2004.

_Labor Costs_

Labor costs increased by €3.4 million, or 1.5%, to €235.4 million in 2005 from €232.0 million in 2004 and, as a percentage of
revenues, they decreased from 17.1% in 2004 to 16.7% in 2005. The absolute increase was attributable to wage increases offset by a
reduction in headcount of 48 employees, which decreased to 4,746 employees in 2005 from 4,794 employees in 2004.

_Other Operating Costs Except Unusual Items_

Other operating costs except unusual items increased by €29.0 million, or 8.0%, to €388.2 million in 2005 from €359.2 million in
2004 and, as a percentage of revenues, they increased from 26.5% in 2004 to 27.4% in 2005. The absolute increase was primarily
attributable to increased energy costs of €17.4 million and increased distribution costs of €7.4 million.

_EBITDA_

65


-----

EBITDA increased by €5.1 million, or 2.9%, to €183.0 million in 2005 from €177.8 million in 2004. This increase was attributable
to higher sales volumes partially offset by slightly lower gross margins. For 2005, Garda’s and Torraspapel’s EBITDA margins were
higher than Condat’s EBITDA margin. As compared to 2004, Garda’s EBITDA margin in 2005 decreased slightly, Torraspapel’s
EBITDA margin was unchanged, and Condat’s EBITDA margin increased slightly.

_Depreciation and Amortization_

Depreciation and amortization decreased by €3.6 million, or 4.0%, to €85.8 million in 2005 from €89.4 million in 2004. This
decrease was primarily attributable to decreases in capital expenditures as a result of the completion of upgrades.

_Unusual Items_

In 2005, we recorded an unusual loss of €1.4 million relating to disposals of fixed assets. In 2004, we recorded an unusual loss of
€4.5 million primarily as a result of costs of €2.5 million in connection with amendments to our financing arrangements and costs of
€1.3 million in connection with the write-down of our shareholding in Expresso Paper Platform B.V.

_Finance Costs_

Finance costs increased by €5.2 million, or 9.2%, to €61.4 million in 2005 from €56.2 million in 2004. This increase was primarily
attributable to a change in accounting standard which required the capitalization of issue costs on borrowings incurred in 2001 and
2002 and the amortization of such costs in 2005, as well as higher early payment discounts to customers.

_Income Taxes_

Income taxes increased by €4.1 million, or 35.4%, to €15.5 million in 2005 from €11.5 million in 2004. This increase was
primarily attributable to higher profits before tax.

**Liquidity and Capital Resources**

**_Liquidity_**

Our primary sources of liquidity are cash from operating activities and borrowings under our RCF.

_Existing Credit Facilities_

We have been making timely payments on the debt outstanding under our Existing Credit Facilities and have also made voluntary
pre-payments under the Existing Credit Facilities and predecessor credit facilities of €219.9 million since 1998. However, our results
of operations and financial condition have deteriorated, in line with the industry overall, during the last few years, and payments under
the Existing Credit Facilities are due to increase significantly during 2008. We have concluded that without refinancing our existing
debt structure, we will not be able to repay principal at the times or in the amounts currently contemplated or to satisfy the required
financial covenant ratios in the Existing Credit Facilities without obtaining waivers or taking other extraordinary actions. In the past
several years, we have on various occasions sought and obtained waivers and amendments to our Existing Credit Facilities, including
with respect to financial covenants.

_Nine Months Ended September 30, 2006 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2005_

During the first nine months of 2006, our cash and cash equivalents increased by €39.3 million or 32.7%, from €120.1 million at
January 1, 2006 to €159.3 million at September 30, 2006. Our principal uses of cash during the first nine months of 2006 were for
purchases of property, plant and equipment of €30.3 million, interest payments of €44.0 million and tax payments of €7.2 million.
During the first nine months of 2006, our working capital decreased by €24.0 million due primarily to higher accounts payable.

During the first nine months of 2006, our cash flows from operating activities were €119.7 million, €30.7 million less than our
cash flows from operating activities during the first nine months of 2005. This decrease was primarily due to lower EBITDA during
the first nine months of 2006 together with an increase in income taxes, partially offset by a decrease in working capital.

During the first nine months of 2006, our cash flows used in investing activities were €24.7 million, €5.8 million less than our cash
flows used in investing activities during the first nine months of 2005. This decrease was primarily due to increased proceeds from the
disposal of property, plant and equipment of €6.2 million resulting from the sale of tangible assets by Torraspapel during the first nine
months of 2006.

During the first nine months of 2006, our cash flows used in financing activities were €55.7 million, €47.6 million less than our
cash flows used in financing activities during the first nine months of 2005. This decrease was primarily due to an increase of €175.6
million in proceeds from borrowings during the first nine months of 2006, partially offset by an increase of €123.1 million used for the
repayment of borrowings.

_Year Ended December 31, 2005 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2004_

During 2005, our cash and cash equivalents decreased by €21.5 million or 15.2%, from €141.6 million at January 1, 2005 to
€120.1 million at December 31, 2005. Our principal uses of cash in 2005 were for purchases of property, plant and equipment of €47.9
million, interest payments of €57.9 million and tax payments of €6.2 million. In 2005, our working capital slightly decreased by €4.9
million.

During 2005, our cash flows from operating activities were €183.5 million, a €32.5 million increase from our cash flows from
operating activities during 2004. This increase reflects, in part, slightly higher EBITDA during 2005, together with a decrease in
working capital. Although our cash flows from operating activities for 2005 reflect inventory increases and higher trade receivables,
working capital decreased due to significantly increased trade payables as compared to 2004. Changes in operating cash flows
between 2005 and 2004 also reflect a decrease of €5.5 million in income taxes in 2005.

During 2005, our cash flows used in investing activities were €47.8 million, €15.9 million less than the €63.7 million of cash flows
used in investing activities in 2004. This decrease was primarily due to decreases in 2005 in net investments in property, plant and
equipment, resulting from final payments being made in 2004 for our program of major paper machine rebuilds.

During 2005, our cash flows used in financing activities were €157.4 million, €37.3 million more than the €120.1 million of cash
flows used in financing activities in 2004. This increase reflects primarily the lack of significant proceeds from borrowings in 2005 as
well as non-mandatory prepayments in 2005 under the Existing Credit Facilities of €30.0 million. In 2004, proceeds from borrowings
were €61.1 million, offset by €62.2 million used in 2004 for non-mandatory prepayments under the Existing Credit Facilities.

**_Capital Resources_**

Our total capital resources amounted to €476.1 million in total equity and €719.6 million in non-current interest-bearing
borrowings as at September 30, 2006, compared to €463.2 million and €739.5 million, respectively, as at December 31, 2005. In
addition, current interest-bearing borrowings amounted to €47.4 million as at September 30, 2006, compared to €29.5 million as at
December 31, 2005.

Our total capital resources amounted to €463.2 million in total equity and €739.5 million in non-current interest-bearing
borrowings as at December 31, 2005, compared to €445.3 million and €810.3 million, respectively, as at December 31, 2004. In
addition, current interest-bearing borrowings amounted to €29.5 million as at December 31, 2005, compared to €63.0 million as at
December 31, 2004.

68


-----

In connection with the Refinancing, amounts outstanding under the Existing Credit Facilities will be repaid and the Existing Credit
Facilities will be terminated. On or around the date of the issue of the Notes, we will enter into the RCF. The RCF provides for a €75.0
million multicurrency, multi-lender revolving credit facility, of which €60.0 million is committed.

**_Capital Expenditures and Investments_**

In the nine months ended September 30, 2006, capital expenditures were €31.2 million and included €15.4 million for
maintenance, €1.0 million for major paper machine rebuilds, €7.7 million for cost reduction and productivity improvement, €6.0
million for environment and safety and €2.1 million for information technology, offset by an increase in capital payables (accounts
payable to suppliers of capital equipment) of €0.9 million.

In 2005, capital expenditures were €49.8 million and included €23.5 million for maintenance, €14.1 million for cost reduction and
productivity improvement, €10.5 million for environment and safety and €3.5 million for information technology, offset by an
increase in capital payables of €2.2 million.

In 2004, capital expenditures were €64.2 million and included €10.8 million for maintenance, €12.7 million for major paper
machine rebuilds, €15.8 million for cost reduction and productivity improvement, €12.1 million for environment and safety and €4.0
million for information technology and were further increased by a decrease in capital payables of €8.8 million.

We expect to make capital expenditures in the fourth quarter of 2006 of approximately €20.3 million. Of that amount, we estimate
approximately €14.7 million will relate to maintenance, €1.2 million will relate to major paper machine rebuilds, €9.7 million will
relate to cost reduction and productivity improvement, €6.0 million will relate to environment and safety and €1.9 million will relate
to information technology, which will be offset by a €12.6 million increase in capital payables.

We expect to make total capital expenditures in 2007 of approximately €69.3 million. Of that amount, we estimate approximately
€10 million will relate to the construction of our new cogeneration facility in Riva del Garda, Italy, €14.7 million will relate to
maintenance, €19.2 million will relate to cost reduction and productivity improvement, €6.3 million will relate to environment and
safety, and €3.6 million will relate to information technology, which will be further increased by a decrease in capital payables of
€15.4 million.

**Contractual Obligations**

The following table summarizes our contractual obligations and principal payments as of September 30, 2006 under debt
instruments, capital and operating leases and other agreements on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Refinancing. The
information presented in the table below reflects our estimates of the contractual maturities of obligations. These maturities may differ
significantly from the actual maturity of these obligations.

-----

(1) The contractual obligations included in the above table do not include interest to be paid on long-term debt or outstanding
purchase obligations. The outstanding purchase obligations are entered into in the normal course of business.

**_Employee Benefits_**

We currently operate a defined contribution pension plan and a defined benefit pension plan for the benefit of our employees in
Italy, France and Spain.

Our long-term employee benefits provisions primarily comprise obligations under our pension plans, death and disability plans,
staff leaving indemnities and long-term service awards. Our long-term employee benefits provisions amounted to €27.8 million as at
September 30, 2006 and €28.9 million and €26.2 million as at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. All of these obligations are
unfunded.

There were no changes in long-term employee benefits provisions due to changes in actuarial assumptions in the nine months
ended September 30, 2006.

**_Contingent Liabilities_**

We are involved from time to time in legal proceedings and other claims that arise in the normal course of business. In the
judgment of management no losses, in excess of provisions made or covered by insurance programs, which would be material in
relation to our financial position are likely to arise in respect of these matters, although their occurrence may have a significant effect
on periodic results.

**_Put and Call Arrangement Between Torraspapel Holding S.A. and Grupo Torras, S.A._**

Torraspapel Holding S.A. (“TPH”), the direct parent of Torraspapel, agreed on November 5, 1999 a put-call arrangement with
Grupo Torras, S.A., (“Grupo Torras”), the previous owner of Torraspapel and currently a minority shareholder in Torraspapel.
Pursuant to this agreement, Grupo Torras may put its entire shareholding in Torraspapel to TPH if certain conditions are fulfilled. The
total amount of Grupo Torras’s shareholding in Torraspapel is currently in dispute. Grupo Torras owns an undisputed 2.50% of the
shares in Torraspapel. Grupo Torras also claims to own 2.45% of the shares in Torraspapel, with the ownership of this 2.45%
shareholding disputed by a third party. This dispute is the subject of litigation between Grupo Torras and the third party and is
ongoing. The outcome of this dispute is uncertain, and it is not known when the dispute might be resolved. Regardless of in whose
favor the dispute is resolved, if Grupo Torras exercises its right to put its shares in Torraspapel in accordance with the agreement, TPH
will be required to purchase Grupo Torras’s entire shareholding in Torraspapel. On December 31, 2005, TPH recognized a provision
on the value of the shares subject to Grupo Torras’s put option, at a purchase price of €6.00 per share for a total of €6.8 million.

**Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements**

Condat has guaranteed the obligations of a supplier in respect of a finished goods storage building totaling €3.0 million.

We do not believe this off-balance sheet arrangement is likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes
in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditure or capital resources that would be
material to investors.

**Sensitivity Analysis**

Our profitability is affected by a number of variables. The table below illustrates how a change in selected factors (on the
assumption that other factors are neutral) related to our business may affect our financial performance on an annual basis.

**Percentage** **Estimated effect on**
**Change** **EBITDA**
**(in millions of euro)**
Paper prices ................. +/-1% +/-14.2
Volumes:
Operating rates(1)........ +/-1% +/-4.7
Deliveries .................... +/-1% +/-4.9
Currency:
USD against EUR(2)... +/-1% -/+1.5
GBP against EUR........ +/-1% +/-1.7
CAD against EUR ....... +/-1% +/-0.2
Pulp prices................... +/-1% -/+3.1
Energy prices............... +/-1% -/+1.0

__________

(1) Increases/decreases in percentage points.

(2) A one percent appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the euro, with all other things being equal, would result in a €1.5 million
euro decline in our EBITDA. However, depreciation of the U.S. dollar against the euro tends to exert downward pressure on
euro paper prices and upward pressure on U.S. dollar pulp prices and generally has an adverse effect on our results of
operations.

**Financial Risk Management**

**_Foreign Exchange Risk_**

Our operations are impacted by the fluctuations of non-euro currencies, primarily U.S. dollars, Canadian dollars and pounds
sterling. This foreign currency exposure includes foreign currency-denominated sales and foreign currency-denominated purchases.
Sales and purchases are hedged through forward agreements and options.

The following table sets forth the main types of foreign exchange derivative agreements that we use, and their values as at
December 31, 2005:

**Valued as at**
**Foreign exchange derivative agreements** **December 31, 2005**
**(in millions of euro)**
Forward agreements on realized sales in foreign
currencies ........................................................................ 41.6
Forward agreements on realized purchases in foreign
currencies ........................................................................ 47.4
Options on future sales in foreign currencies.................... 16.1

**_Interest Rate Risk_**

The interest rates for a portion of our senior debt are typically hedged according to EURIBOR 3 month collars, caps, floors or
similar instruments. As at September 30, 2006, we have hedged €400.0 million of our senior debt using interest rate caps.

**_Commodity Risk_**

We do not currently hedge against raw material costs.

**INDUSTRY AND MARKET OVERVIEW**

The paper industry is capital intensive and highly competitive. Long-term demand for paper is driven by global economic trends,
demographic trends, technological developments and trends in end-user preferences. The segment of the paper industry in which we
compete includes coated woodfree paper and specialty papers.

Profitability in the paper industry is highly sensitive to changes in prices, and industry profit cycles reflect the constantly shifting
balance between supply and demand for individual products, as well as changes in customer inventory levels. Periods of industry-wide
investment in new production capacity or significant contractions in demand due to weak economic conditions have, in previous
industry cycles, led to decreases in product prices, often as a result of excess capacity. For instance, the industry pursued growth in the
mid 1990s by significantly increasing production capacity at a time when pulp and paper prices were at record high levels. This caused
a significant imbalance between supply and demand and resulted in a rapid decline in pulp prices and a corresponding decline in paper
prices in late 1995 and throughout 1996.

During the past several years there has been a significant shift in industry strategy. Prior to 1997, the European coated woodfree
paper manufacturing industry, in which we primarily compete, was fragmented and consisted of 14 companies of note, with the top
five producers only comprising approximately 44% of production capacity. The high costs associated with building new paper mills
and organically growing market share has encouraged companies to focus growth strategies on acquisitions rather than on the
construction of additional capacity. As a result, from 1998 to 2001, the paper industry experienced a period of consolidation. This
consolidation has helped to reduce industry pricing volatility. The regional market share of leading European producers has increased
significantly over the past decade. Today, in the European coated woodfree paper manufacturing industry, there are six major
producers comprising approximately 85% of production capacity. We believe that large paper producers will continue to pursue
growth through acquisitions rather than organic expansion and that, as a result of industry consolidation, the cyclicality of the industry
may be less pronounced going forward.

Following a cyclical industry peak in 2000 and early 2001, which resulted in significant investments in Europe to increase
production capacity, the European paper industry experienced a downturn, which began in late 2001 and continued through 2002 and
2003, as decreased demand resulted in oversupply, causing downward pressure on paper prices. In 2004, for the first time since 2000,
economic growth in Europe increased against the previous year, and the amount of money spent on printed advertising, which tends to
track economic growth, similarly increased in Western Europe, resulting in increased demand for paper. However, the Western
European market continued to be burdened by overcapacity, and due to competition among paper producers, the increased demand did
not result in increased paper prices. In 2005, economic growth slowed in Europe as compared to the previous year, and the growth in
paper demand likewise slowed, although it grew at a faster rate than the overall economy. In addition, although growth in production
capacity slowed and supply was reduced by a labor dispute impacting Finnish paper producers, excess capacity continued to exist and
prices remained low. In the first nine months of 2006, coated woodfree paper demand in Western Europe grew at a slightly lower rate
than for the full year 2005 and at a rate lower than the overall economic growth rate. Additionally, in this same time period, energy
and raw material costs continued to increase, and the U.S. dollar remained weak.

In response to challenging conditions in the paper industry, some of our competitors have recently announced European capacity
reductions which we anticipate will, when implemented, improve the supply/demand imbalance in Europe and consequently should
contribute to further price stabilization. Specifically, UPM—Kymmene Corporation closed production capacity at two of its facilities
during the third quarter of 2006 and has also announced the planned closure of another facility in the second quarter of 2007; Stora
Enso has announced its intention to close two of its facilities during 2007; and M-real has confirmed that it will close one facility by
January 31, 2007 and reduce production at another by February 28, 2007. According to a recent Pöyry study, after giving effect to the
announced shutdowns, but without taking into account capacity creep, European coated woodfree paper capacity is expected to
decrease by approximately 6% by the end of 2007, and current industry operating rates, which are approximately 91%, are expected to
increase to approximately 94% during 2007. We believe that the industry’s pricing power historically has strengthened when operating
rates reach 95%.

Europe is the world’s largest producer of coated woodfree paper and has been a significant net exporter to Asia and the Americas.
As a result of significant planned and forecasted capacity expansion in Asia, net exports by European producers are expected to
decrease, which will impact demand for coated woodfree paper produced in Europe and exert downward pressure on coated woodfree

paper prices. In addition, the European market may encounter greater import competition from Asia and potentially Latin America as
well.

According to CEPIFINE, the growth rate in demand for coated woodfree paper in Southern Europe was 1.7%, 2.4% and 1.4%
higher than that for Western Europe as a whole for the years 2003, 2004 and 2005, respectively. Moreover, demand for coated
woodfree paper in Eastern Europe has surged recently, fueled in part by an increase in the number of Eastern European printers
serving Western European end-users. In the years 2003, 2004 and 2005, the growth rate in demand for coated woodfree paper in
Eastern Europe was 26%, 27% and 16%, respectively, according to CEPIFINE.

**Paper**

The papermaking process is relatively similar for all kinds of paper, with variations for different paper products based primarily on
the type of pulp used and the existence or absence of coatings. We primarily produce coated woodfree paper and also produce
specialty papers.

**_Coated Woodfree Paper_**

Coated woodfree paper is the highest value-added, mass-produced product in the paper industry. Coated woodfree paper has
historically been one of the fastest growing industry segments. Approximately 9.5 million metric tons of coated woodfree paper are
manufactured in Europe each year, and over 20 million metric tons are produced worldwide.

Coated woodfree paper is made from chemical pulp and is coated on one or both sides with minerals and chemicals to increase the
brightness and smoothness of the paper, allowing for higher-quality printing. The finer printing qualities of coated woodfree paper are
a function of its weight and surface properties. Wood fiber comprises about 60% of each sheet of coated woodfree paper and provides
its structure and strength. A coating of minerals, primarily calcium carbonate, or marble held together with binders, is layered on top.
This mineral coating gives the sheet a very smooth surface, which allows for very high printing resolution and the reproduction of
small nuances of color and texture. Coated woodfree paper is generally used for commercial printing, magazines, brochures, annual
reports, advertising materials and art books because of its strength, printability and brightness. Because coated woodfree paper is used
where high reprographic quality is required, it typically serves higher-end uses and therefore commands a higher price compared to
other types of paper. In addition, since the manufacture of coated woodfree paper requires a complex and demanding production
process, its pricing has been less volatile relative to lower quality paper grades.

The growth of the commercial press and advertising sectors in Europe in recent years has favored continued development of the
coated woodfree paper sector. We believe, based on projections of European paper industry analysts, that demand for coated woodfree
paper will continue to increase in line with general economic growth in the forthcoming years. In Europe, a slight increase in
advertising and direct marketing is expected to stimulate demand for advertising-driven papers. For the period from 2002 to 2005, our

73


-----

estimates indicate that the growth rate in demand for coated woodfree paper in Western Europe averaged 5% per year, which exceeds
the growth in demand for other types of paper, and is largely the result of an increasing variety of end uses. However, the growth of
consumption rates in Western Europe and North America has remained marginal due to the practice by paper distributors of building
inventory levels and then satisfying end-user demand from those inventories when paper prices are high. In this way, paper
distributors limit the extent to which the effects of increased demand are passed on to paper manufacturers.

Although demand has been growing for several years, the increased demand has not resulted in increased paper prices. Significant
investments were made in Europe in 2000 and 2001 to increase coated woodfree paper production capacity. The industry then
experienced a downturn beginning in late 2001, which continued through 2003, as lower demand resulted in oversupply, which
exerted further downward pressure on coated woodfree paper prices. The weak U.S. dollar against the pound sterling and the euro
aggravated the effects of decreased prices. Recently, however, excess coated woodfree paper production capacity has diminished. In
2006, there were a number of closures by leading European paper manufacturers, and more closures are planned for 2007, which has
resulted in lower overall production capacity in Europe. Specifically, UPM— Kymmene Corporation closed production capacity at
two of its facilities during the third quarter of 2006 and has also announced the planned closure of another facility in the second
quarter of 2007; Stora Enso has announced its intention to close two of its facilities during 2007; and M-real has confirmed that it will
close one facility by January 31, 2007 and reduce production at another by February 28, 2007. Operating rates in the coated woodfree
paper industry have risen to approximately 91% from a low of approximately 80% in 2001 and are expected to increase to 94% during
2007, if the planned capacity reductions occur as anticipated (excluding any capacity creep).

A recent Pöyry study indicated that, despite forecasts of a slowdown in demand growth during 2007, coated woodfree paper prices
are expected to increase slightly as paper producers implement stronger supply control measures and planned production capacity
shutdowns go into effect. According to Pöyry, in 2007, demand for coated woodfree paper in Europe is expected to increase by 1.6%
for the year compared to a demand increase of 2.2% for 2006. Pöyry predicts that demand will grow at a slower pace during the first
half of 2007 and will improve during the second half of 2007. Pöyry predicts demand in Europe for coated woodfree paper will grow
by 2.3% to 3.6% per year between 2008 and 2010, based on, among other things, an assumption that the economy will be stronger,
and as a result, spending on advertising will increase. This demand growth is predicted despite planned coated woodfree paper
capacity expansions in Asia, which are largely expected to supply the Asian market and may impact Asian demand for both reels and
sheeted products produced in Europe.

The following graph and table, both reproduced from a Pöyry study, illustrate trends and forecasts for European coated woodfree
paper capacity and production.

In recent years, coated woodfree paper prices in Western Europe have been under pressure, and pulp prices have increased,
causing a narrowing of the Gap, an industry indicator, defined by Pöyry, and calculated as the difference between the price of coated

woodfree paper in Germany and 60% of the price of bleached hardwood kraft pulp, which are, in turn, benchmark figures used in the
coated woodfree paper industry.

The following table sets forth, in euro per metric ton of sheeted coated woodfree paper, selected net sales prices for Garda, Condat
and Torraspapel for the periods presented.

Torraspapel.. 909 787 906 784 903 775

In the near term, Pöyry expects coated woodfree paper prices to increase by approximately 4%, from €820 per ton in 2005 to €855
per ton by 2007. In the third and fourth quarters of 2006, we and a number of our competitors announced price increases. Pöyry
expects pulp prices to decline in the near term as a result of new pulp production capacity coming on-stream. According to Pöyry, this
increased pulp capacity will increase supply in the market between late 2006 and 2008, with a significant part of the capacity growth
in Latin America. Pöyry predicts that the average price of bleached hardwood kraft pulp will decline by 10.6% during 2007 as a result
of this increased supply. According to the graph below, in the third quarter of 2006, the Gap reached a low point and has since
improved. Forecasted increases in the price of coated woodfree paper and decreases in the price of pulp would be expected to lead to
an increased Gap over the following quarters.

The graph below illustrates historical prices for, and Pöyry’s forecasts for the development of, coated woodfree paper prices,
bleached hardwood kraft pulp prices and the Gap, calculated as described above.

**_Specialty Papers_**

Specialty papers are made from both chemical and mechanical pulp and like coated woodfree paper are typically used where high
reprographic quality is required, such as for graphic design, labels, converting, forms and digital imaging. Our specialty papers
business is conducted by Torraspapel. The specialty papers business encompasses a wide range of products aimed at more diverse
markets and smaller volume applications than coated woodfree paper.

The following is an overview of the types of specialty papers that we produce:

_Thermal. Thermal paper is a copy paper which uses heat to produce its image. Thermal papers are commonly used as the printout_
paper for receipts from point-of-sale machines. Based on studies conducted by EPTA and Laves Chemie, as well as our own
estimates, we believe that European demand for thermal paper grew at a rate of 10% in 2006, and we expect it to grow at a rate of 9%
in 2007.

_Metallized._ Metallized paper has a thick deposit of metallized particles that resemble a layer of foil. Metallized paper offers
reduced stiffness and flexibility and is used for labels, cigarette packets, luxury packaging, gift wrapping and self-adhesive labels.
According to EMA, European demand for metallized paper is believed to have grown at a rate of 6% in 2006, and our own estimates
are that it again will continue to grow at a rate of 6% in 2007.

_Self-Adhesive. Self-adhesive paper is used primarily for printing labels. This paper has a self-adhesive coating on one side and a_
surface suitable for printing on the other. According to FINAT, European demand for self-adhesive paper grew at a rate of 3.4% in
2005, and, based on our own estimates, it grew at a rate of 8% in 2006.

75


-----

_One-Side Coated. One-side coated paper is paper that has had a surface coating applied to one side to produce smoothness. One-_
side coated paper is designed so it can be printed very easily with metallic ink. It is primarily used for printing labels. We believe that
the one-side coated paper market is healthy and stable.

_Carbonless._ Carbonless paper is an alternative to carbon paper and is typically used to make multiple copies of an original
document without the use of any electronics. For example, carbonless paper is used for car rental contracts. We believe that the
carbonless paper market is declining.

_Cast-Coated. Cast coating produces a high mirror gloss finish on paper. Cast-coated paper is used to produce high quality labels_
and luxury packaging, as well as other applications having sophisticated printing requirements. We believe that the cast-coated paper
market is declining.

_Uncoated. Uncoated paper is paper that does not have any kind of coating applied. Uncoated paper is available in many different_
finishes, colors, and weights and is generally more absorbent than coated papers. It is suitable for writing with ink on both sides and
for various basic printing purposes. In response to periodic decreases in demand for coated woodfree paper, we produce uncoated
paper at our coated woodfree paper mills as a means of absorbing fixed costs.

The following table sets forth, in euro per metric ton, prices for specialty papers in selected markets for the periods presented.

__________

(1) Prices for self-adhesive paper are shown in euro per 100 square meters. One metric ton of self-adhesive paper is equivalent to
5,000 square meters of self-adhesive paper.

**Pulp**

Wood pulp is the principal raw material required to manufacture paper. Pulp is converted from wood by means of mechanical or
chemical processes. Chemical pulp, used to manufacture coated woodfree paper, is produced by cooking wood chips in solutions of
caustic chemicals to separate the cellulose fibers used for pulping. There are two main types of chemical pulp: long-fiber chemical
pulp, made of spruce or pine wood and used to manufacture paper requiring superior strength, such as magazine paper, and short-fiber
chemical pulp, made of birch, beech or eucalyptus wood and used to manufacture fine papers and boards. The price of pulp is highly
volatile and sensitive to changes in industry capacity, producer inventories, demand for paper, cyclical changes in the world economy
and fluctuations in the U.S. dollar, the reference currency for trading. Fluctuations in pulp prices may, in turn, impact prices of final
paper products. The major chemical pulp producing regions of the world are North America and the Nordic countries.

Many European paper producers have full or nearly full vertical pulp integration, where mills combine wood pulping production
facilities with paper production facilities. Full vertical pulp integration is intended to insulate the producer from sharp variations in the
market price of pulp. However, while full vertical pulp integration may help to stabilize costs, it does not necessarily stabilize
earnings, since finished goods prices will vary depending on what the market will bear. Partial implementation of vertical pulp
integration, such as at Lecta, seeks to maximize earnings stability by increasing production cost stability but at the same time allowing
paper prices to more closely track pulp prices.

**Distribution**

Paper products are generally sold to distributors and directly to printers and major publishers. According to CEPIFINE, in 2005,
approximately 80% of Western European coated woodfree paper sheet sales are estimated to have been sold through paper
distributors. Because smaller paper users cannot efficiently be covered by the dedicated sales personnel of a paper company, paper
distributors sell to small printers, offices, paper and office products supply stores and other small businesses that place orders that are
too small and may contain too many different product specifications for a paper producer to serve directly. Paper distributors purchase
paper in larger quantities from paper producers and then generally warehouse the paper and sell it in smaller lots to these buyers.
Paper distributors generally also conduct marketing and promotion activities and may assume credit risks associated with sales. As
coated woodfree paper is extensively used by small businesses, commercial printers and offices, paper distributors are a particularly
important sales channel for coated woodfree paper.

**Competition**

Competition in the paper industry is intense. Paper products are largely commodities and are subject to substantial price
competition. Due to the weight of paper, it is relatively expensive to transport. Therefore, paper producers who sell their products in
markets geographically close to their mills experience cost savings and are at a competitive advantage over producers who must
transport their paper long distances or over large bodies of water. In addition, although most large industrial paper machines produce
paper onto reels, most demand for coated woodfree and specialty papers in Europe is for sheeted paper. As a result, most paper
produced by paper mills needs to be converted to sheets, and in general this conversion takes place following specific customer orders.
To reduce the delivery time of customer orders, paper manufacturers must operate converting facilities close to their principal markets.
Many of our Nordic competitors incur higher transportation costs and thus are at a competitive disadvantage from having to ship
reeled paper to remote converting facilities located near to customers and then ship it on to customers. Moreover, manufacturers who
maintain converting facilities at or near their mills experience cost savings due to their ability to reuse the paper waste created from
the cutting process. Brand value is also an important factor in the paper industry, which is characterized by significant loyalty among
printers and end-users. Several other factors also influence a paper producer’s competitive position, including cost of raw materials,
efficiency of mills, product quality and customer service. Our primary competition comes from other large paper producers, including
Burgo-Marchi Group, M-real, Sappi, Stora Enso and UPM-Kymmene.

**BUSINESS**

**Our Company**

We are the largest coated woodfree paper manufacturer in Southern Europe (consisting primarily of Spain, Portugal, France and
Italy) and the third largest coated woodfree paper manufacturer in Europe, with an annual production capacity of 1,500,000 metric
tons. We are also one of the leading manufacturers of specialty papers in Europe, with an annual production capacity of 220,000
metric tons. In addition, we operate a 230,000 metric ton pulp mill in Spain, which provides approximately 30% of our overall pulp
requirements for all of our coated woodfree paper mills. We have ten coated woodfree paper machines and six specialty paper
machines in eleven mills located at various sites in Italy, France and Spain. In the year ended December 31, 2005, our mills produced
an aggregate of 1,359,100 metric tons of coated woodfree paper and 222,200 metric tons of specialty papers, including uncoated
paper, a type of specialty paper produced by our coated woodfree paper mills. We market our products principally in Spain, Portugal
and France, where we rank first by market share, in Italy, where we rank second by market share, and also in other European countries
and, to a lesser extent, outside of Europe. Our mills are located in close proximity to our key commercial printing markets in Spain,
Portugal, France and Italy, where, according to CEPIFINE, approximately 35% of European commercial printing deliveries of coated
woodfree paper are made (9% in Spain, 1% in Portugal, 12% in France and 13% in Italy). During the year ended December 31, 2005,
we had total sales of €1,414.8 million and EBITDA of €183.0 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2006 and the
twelve months ended September 30, 2006, we had total sales of €1,075.0 million and €1,433.7 million, respectively, and EBITDA of
€105.4 million and €149.1 million, respectively.

The Lecta group was initially formed by CVC in 1997 to acquire Garda of Italy in October of that year, and it subsequently
acquired Condat of France in November 1998 and Torraspapel of Spain in December 1999, all three of which are long-established
paper manufacturing companies. Garda, Condat and Torraspapel produce coated woodfree paper for sale under their own brand
names, which we believe are well-established in the European market. Torraspapel also produces a variety of specialty papers,
including thermal, metallized and self-adhesive papers. In addition, Torraspapel acts as a distributor of coated woodfree paper and
speciality papers in Spain, Portugal and France, and in the year ended December 31, 2005, Torraspapel distributed 430,000 metric tons
of paper, of which 82,500 metric tons were produced by third parties.

We have a high-quality asset base, which achieves excellent operating performance. Between 1999 and 2003, we invested €499.6
million in rebuilding our papermaking, coating and converting machines, reducing costs and improving productivity, enhancing our
information technology, implementing environmental and safety improvements and maintenance. As a result of our capital
expenditures, the coated woodfree paper capacity of our mills has grown from approximately 1,000,000 metric tons in 1999 to
1,500,000 metric tons currently. We have accomplished this expansion in production capacity through upgrades to our existing
machines rather than by the addition of new machines. Over the same period, we have reduced both our variable and fixed costs
through machine modernization and various cost reduction initiatives, including coordination of sales and marketing and raw material
purchases and extensive internal and external benchmarking of our production processes. From 2001 to 2006, we increased our metric
tons of paper and pulp produced per employee from 306 metric tons to 392 metric tons, representing an increase in metric tons of
paper and pulp produced per employee of approximately 28%.

The following table sets forth certain information with respect to our operations for, or as at the end of, the year ended December

**Our Strengths**

We believe we have a number of competitive advantages, including:

**_Strong Market Positions in Coated Woodfree Paper. We are the market leader for coated woodfree paper in Southern Europe._**
The following table sets forth our estimated rankings and market share in our principal markets for coated woodfree paper.

**Ranking** **Market Share(1)**
Spain and Portugal... #1 44%
France...................... #1 29%
Italy.......................... #2 26%

__________

(1) Includes sales by Torraspapel of approximately 82,500 metric tons of paper produced by other paper manufacturers.

The majority of our products are sold under our own brand names, and according to an industry study commissioned in 2005, our
brands have the highest name recognition among our target customers in Spain and Italy and the second highest name recognition
among our target customers in France. We engage in a variety of targeted promotional activities and advertising to enhance the
recognition of our brands, as we believe that this helps to differentiate our products.

**_Optimal Location of Mills, Proximity to Customers. Our mills are strategically located in close proximity to key commercial_**
printing markets in Southern Europe. According to CEPIFINE, approximately 35% of European commercial printing deliveries of
coated woodfree paper take place in Spain, Portugal, France and Italy. The strategic location of our mills allows us to keep
transportation costs, which are generally a substantial portion of sales prices, low relative to those of our competitors, particularly our
competitors with mills in Nordic countries. In addition, although most large industrial paper machines produce paper onto reels, most
demand for coated woodfree and specialty papers in Europe is for sheeted paper. As a result, most paper produced by paper mills
needs to be converted to sheets, and in general this conversion takes place following specific customer orders. To reduce the delivery
time of customers’ orders, paper manufacturers must operate converting facilities close to their principal markets. The proximity of
our mills to our customers allows for sheet converting to take place at our mill sites, which results in cost savings and improved
inventory management and customer service. Many of our Nordic competitors incur higher transportation costs and thus are at a
competitive disadvantage from having to ship reeled paper to remote converting facilities located near to customers and then ship it on
to customers. Moreover, maintaining converting facilities at or near our mills provides us with cost savings due to our ability to reuse
the paper waste created from the cutting process. We believe that being in close proximity to our customers also allows us to provide
higher levels of customer service.

**_Attractive and Growing End-User Market. We are well positioned to benefit from growth in the Southern European markets and_**
growth in the coated woodfree paper markets. According to CEPIFINE, the market for coated woodfree paper in Southern Europe
grew at a rate of 1.7%, 2.4%, and 1.4% higher than the growth rate for Western Europe as a whole during the years 2003, 2004 and
2005, respectively, reflecting higher economic growth in Southern Europe. In addition, the market for coated woodfree paper has
historically grown at a faster rate than markets for other types of papers in response to demand from customers in growing markets for
adverising and commercial printing. We expect this trend to continue in the future.

**_Well-Invested Asset Base and Efficient Low-Cost Production. All of our paper machines were modernized through a series of_**
investment projects between 1999 and 2003, and as a result, our production capacity increased by 50% between 1999 and 2006. With
an average annual output of between 115,000 and 230,000 metric tons each, our coated woodfree paper machines are among the most
efficient in Europe. We believe that the efficiency of our paper machines, coupled with low transportation and sheet converting costs,
provides us with a cost advantage in our key markets. We believe, for example, that on a delivered basis, we are the lowest cost
producer in Europe for shipments to Madrid, Milan and Paris, where a significant number of our customers are located. If warranted

79


-----

by market conditions, we could increase our coated woodfree paper production by 130,000 metric tons per year without additional
capital investment by eliminating commercial downtime in our mills.

**_Flexibility and Variety in Production. We manufacture our coated woodfree paper on medium-width machines, which we believe_**
are better suited for the production of most coated woodfree paper products than the wider-width machines that many of our
competitors use. Because the coated woodfree paper market generally demands a greater variety of basis weights and surface finishes
than other types of graphic paper, these machines allow us to produce our paper in a broad range of basis weights and coated surface
finishes while maintaining optimal production runs with minimal waste and downtime between runs.

**_Successful Distribution Business Directly Linked to Customer Base._** In addition to their production operations, our Spanish
operations include a highly successful distribution business, which distributes both our own coated woodfree and specialty papers and
those produced by third parties. This distribution business enhances our ability to provide a high level of customer service by
improving our understanding of our customers’ product and service needs, which allows us more effectively to develop and market
new products to meet such requirements.

(BAR CHART)

**_Skilled Personnel, Incentivized Management and Sponsor Support. Our management team is experienced and is highly regarded_**
by participants in the paper industry. We maintain a decentralized organizational structure and continue to run Garda, Condat and
Torraspapel as separate operating subsidiaries. Each of the three subsidiaries has its own CEO with over 20 years of experience in the
paper industry. With an aggregate equity stake in Lecta S.A. of approximately 8.6%, our management team is highly incentivized. In
addition, each of our senior managers has been granted an incentive package with a strong focus on increasing sales, productivity and
cash generation. We also benefit from the relationships, investment experience and expertise with manufacturing companies of our
controlling shareholder, CVC, a leading international private equity and investment advisory firm, whose Industrial Advisory Board
includes members with diverse manufacturing backgrounds.

**Our Strategy**

Our objectives are to build on our position as the leading coated woodfree paper producer in Southern Europe. The key elements of
our strategy are as follows:

**_Maintain Low-Cost Production and Achieve Further Operating Efficiencies. We believe we are a low cost producer due in large_**
part to our past capital investment projects, which have improved the efficiency of our machines. We seek to improve the efficiency of
all of our mills and thereby to increase our cost competitiveness and margins. We are taking a number of measures to increase
productivity as measured by metric tons produced per employee. Our three operating subsidiaries continually share best practices to
increase production efficiency, optimize technological processes, manage risks and reduce costs. We also measure the performance of
each of our mills against internal and external benchmarks relating to operational key indicators and raw material consumption. We
are replicating our success in energy cogeneration in Spain by replacing our existing cogeneration facility in Italy. Following its
expected completion in 2008, we estimate it will improve Garda’s EBITDA by approximately €10 million to €12 million per year.
This facility will require a total investment of approximately €50 million, of which, as of October 31, 2006, €1.3 million has been
invested.

**_Focus on Higher-Margin Products. We continue to shift our product mix towards products that generate higher margins, such as_**
sheeted coated woodfree paper and coated woodfree paper in higher grades and weights, and we are focusing our marketing and
distribution efforts on customers who require these products. In specialty papers, in response to declining demand for carbonless
paper, we are shifting our product mix toward thermal, metallized and self-adhesive papers, all three of which have been experiencing,
and which we expect will continue to experience, growing demand. Our close proximity to European commercial printing markets,
our flexible printing platform and dedication to customer service enable us to effectively shift our product mix.

**_Focus on Our Customers in the Southern European Market. We intend to continue to focus on the Southern European market_**
where we enjoy a cost advantage over Nordic competitors and a leading market position. We may seek to further enhance our
customer focus by expanding our distribution capabilities into our French and Italian operations, while maintaining and further
developing our relationships with third party distributors. We may also seek to expand our direct sales to end-users.

80


-----

**_Enhance Cash Flows. We seek to enhance our cash flows through the foregoing strategies and intend to continue to maintain a_**
disciplined capital expenditure program to maximize our cash flow available for debt reduction. Since 1998, we have repaid €427.3
million principal amount of debt, €219.9 million of which has been made as voluntary pre-payments. Between 1999 and 2003, we
incurred significant capital expenditures to rebuild and modernize our machines, reduce costs and improve productivity. Going
forward, other than for the cogeneration facility in Italy, we do not expect any major new capital expenditure projects other than
capital expenditures necessary to maintain the operating performance of our mills.

**History and Organization of the Lecta Group**

We are controlled by CVC Capital Partners Limited, one of the largest private equity firms in Europe. The Lecta group was
initially formed in 1997 in Luxembourg to participate in the consolidation of the coated woodfree paper manufacturing industry, and it
participated in this consolidation by acquiring Garda in October 1997, Condat in November 1998 and Torraspapel in December 1999,
with the intention of creating a European coated woodfree paper manufacturing group and adding value by realizing synergies and
growing the three businesses as a group.

In general, we take a decentralized approach to the organization of Lecta, with Garda, Condat and Torraspapel maintaining
separate management. Each of our businesses has separate commercial, manufacturing, technical, logistics, finance and human
resources teams that report directly to their respective management. We aim to minimize bureaucracy and excess cost by maintaining
a small central staff with responsibility for high-level and high-priority work. In the areas where we take a centralized and coordinated
approach, we seek to do so without creating central staff. Instead, we create teams comprised of specialists from Garda, Condat and
Torraspapel and then assign leadership responsibilities to one of the team members, who then acts in a company role as well as a
Lecta-wide role. Garda, Condat and Torraspapel continually share best practices to increase production efficiency, optimize
technological processes, manage risks and reduce costs. Through extensive internal benchmarking relating to operational key
indicators and raw material consumption, Garda, Condat and Torraspapel have reduced their variable and fixed costs since the
respective dates of our acquisitions of them.

**Products**

We primarily produce coated woodfree paper. We also manufacture specialty papers.

Coated woodfree paper is made from chemical pulp and is coated on one or both sides with minerals and chemicals to increase the
brightness and smoothness of the paper, allowing for higher-quality printing. Coated woodfree paper is generally used for commercial
printing, magazines, brochures, annual reports, advertising materials and art books because of its strength, printability and brightness.
Because coated woodfree paper is used where high reprographic quality is required and consequently serves higher-end uses, it
commands a higher price compared to other types of paper. We produce our coated woodfree paper with a variety of print
characteristics, coatings and other features in order to meet the specific needs of customers. We are shifting our product mix towards
higher grade, higher weight and sheeted coated woodfree products, which generate higher margins.

Specialty papers are made from both chemical and mechanical pulp and like coated woodfree paper are typically used where high
reprographic quality is required, such as for graphic design, labels, converting, forms and digital imaging. Torraspapel produces our
specialty papers, which include carbonless, thermal, metallized, cast-coated, self-adhesive, one-side coated and uncoated papers. In
response to declining industry demand for carbonless paper, we are successfully shifting our product mix toward thermal, metallized
and self-adhesive papers, which have healthy and growing markets, and are also investing resources to develop new products.

**Customers**

We have a diversified customer base. Our customers for coated woodfree paper consist primarily of distributors, printers and
publishers. Our customers for specialty products consist primarily of distributors, high-end packagers and industrial end-users. In
general, we do not enter into fixed-price agreements with our customers.

A significant portion of coated woodfree paper and specialty papers sales in Europe are conducted through distributors.
Accordingly, we believe that maintaining and further developing our relationships with distributors is an important strategic objective.
We may also seek opportunities to further develop our own distribution capabilities beyond the distribution business currently
conducted by Torraspapel.

81


-----

We sell our products to a large number of customers, and we benefit from numerous long-standing relationships with many of our
most significant customers. In the year ended December 31, 2005, our top ten customers accounted for approximately 25% of our total
net sales. Only one customer accounted for more than 10% of our net sales in the year ended December 31, 2005, and we have entered
into a master purchase agreement with this customer, which will terminate on February 28, 2009. Pursuant to the agreement, this
customer is obligated to purchase, at a minimum, set quantities of our products, and we are obligated to sell our products to it at the
lowest price at which we have made such products available to customers with which we do not have exclusivity arrangements, plus a
one percent rebate on total product sales.

**Marketing and Distribution**

We sell our paper products through the sales networks of our three operating subsidiaries primarily in Italy, France, Spain and
Portugal and also have an established customer base in the United Kingdom, Germany, the United States, Canada, the Netherlands,
Belgium and Luxembourg. We employ approximately 630 sales professionals in our sales networks.

We tailor our sales and marketing activities to serve different categories of customers. Each of Garda, Condat and Torraspapel has
its own marketing team and sales network, and our large accounts in Italy, France and Spain are dealt with directly by the sales
departments in the head offices in each of the three countries. We sell our products primarily to distributors or through Torraspapel’s
distribution business and to a lesser extent directly to printers and publishers.

We believe the locations of our paper mills and distribution centers give us certain logistical advantages over our competitors from
the Nordic countries due to the close proximity of our mills to our major markets. Our Torraspapel paper distribution business
maintains four warehouses in Spain, Portugal and France to service our customers in Madrid, Barcelona, Lisbon and Paris. Most of
our product deliveries are to customers within Europe and we use third parties to transport our products in Europe by truck or rail. We
use third parties to ship our products by sea to customers outside of Europe. In most cases, we own and bear the risk related to the
transported products until they reach the customer or the warehouse chosen by the customer.

**Facilities and Operations**

**_Head Offices_**

Our registered offices are in Luxembourg. The headquarters of Garda is located in Riva del Garda, Italy, the headquarters of
Condat is located in Paris, France and the headquarters of Torraspapel is located in Barcelona, Spain.

**_Production and Distribution_**

We have 11 factories and 16 paper machines that comprise our coated woodfree and specialty paper manufacturing operations. We
manufacture coated woodfree paper at six factories located in Italy, France and Spain on ten paper machines and a variety of
converting, coating and finishing machines and we manufacture specialty papers at seven factories in Spain (two of which also
manufacture coated woodfree paper) on six paper machines and a variety of converting and finishing machines. We believe that our
manufacturing facilities are in excellent operating condition, are suited for the purposes for which they are being used and have
sufficient capacity to meet our production needs for the foreseeable future.

All of our factories are located in close proximity to the local printing markets in Southern Europe, which provides us with a
competitive advantage over our Nordic competitors in our home markets by keeping our transport costs low. Being located near our
local printing markets also allows us to perform sheet converting at our factories, which results in cost savings, lower finished product
weight and improved inventory management and customer service. In contrast to our competitors who operate far from their principal
markets and thus generally must perform sheet converting far from their operating facilities, our on-site converting allows us to reuse
the paper waste produced in the converting process.

Paper machines do not have any set lifespan but rather can be continually upgraded and modernized to change any aspect of their
function, other than width. As a result, we have not purchased any new machines since acquiring each of Garda, Condat and
Torraspapel but rather have invested significant amounts to upgrade the existing machines to improve quality, reduce costs and

82


-----

increase capacity. The machines used at each of our facilities and the components used to upgrade our machines are manufactured by
leading paper machine manufacturers.

We believe that a system of medium-width machines that are modernized, specialized and of high productivity are better suited
than larger, wider machines for the production of the majority of coated woodfree paper products. All of our coated woodfree paper
machines are of medium-width, between three and five meters wide. Our coated woodfree paper machines are specialized to produce
particular basis weights and coated surface finishes. Annual production per machine is between 115,000 and 230,000 metric tons
depending on the type of machine. We have added coating steps and/or coating capacity to all of our production lines, allowing for
more and thicker coating layers on our paper. In addition to improving the quality of our paper, increasing the coating layers allows
for reduced pulp content, and because the additional coating layers cost less than the pulp that would be required without the
additional coating layers, increasing the coating layers also reduces costs.

Our papermaking machines, like those of most other large European paper manufacturers, produce paper onto reels. As most
demand for coated woodfree and specialty papers in Europe is for sheeted paper, we convert approximately 80% of the paper we
produce into sheets. The proximity of our mills to our customers allows for sheet converting to take place at our mill sites, which
results in cost savings, due to lower transportation costs and our ability to reuse the paper waste created from the cutting process, as
well as improved inventory management and customer service.

The following table sets forth the location and use of our manufacturing facilities. These facilities are owned unless otherwise
indicated.

**Italy**

We acquired Garda from Bertelsmann in October 1997. Garda was established in 1956 and acquired in 1971 by Bertelsmann.

Today, Garda operates the largest single paper production site in Italy and has an annual coated woodfree paper production
capacity of 330,000 metric tons. Total sales of Garda’s coated woodfree paper in the year ended December 31, 2005 were 310,000
metric tons, generating revenues of €243.9 million.

The Garda mill, located in Riva del Garda, produces coated woodfree paper. From 1999 to 2003, as part of our capital
improvement program, we invested a total of approximately €66.9 million as follows: €23.4 million for major paper machine rebuilds,
€9.4 million for cost reduction and productivity improvements, €27.1 million for maintenance costs, €1.9 million for information

83


-----

technology improvements and €5.1 million for environmental and safety improvements. Our investments in the Garda mill during
2004 and 2005 totaled €20.5 million.

Together with Alto Garda Servizi, the city-owned utility company in Riva del Garda, we are currently implementing a project to
construct a new cogeneration energy plant, to begin operations in 2008, which will replace the cogeneration facility we currently
operate in Riva del Garda and which will produce both steam and electricity. The plant will be wholly owned by Alto Garda Power, a
joint venture between Garda and Alto Garda Servizi. Garda will have 80% ownership of the joint venture, with Alto Garda Servizi
owning the remaining 20%. Our financial projections indicate that following the expected completion of our new plant in Riva del
Garda in 2008, Garda’s EBITDA should improve by €10 million to €12 million per year.

**France**

We acquired Condat in November 1998 from Smurfit Group (now Smurfit Kappa Group). Condat was established in 1907 and
began papermaking operations in 1931.

Today, Condat has an annual coated woodfree paper production capacity of 540,000 metric tons. Total sales of Condat’s coated
woodfree paper in the year ended December 31, 2005 were 481,000 metric tons, generating revenues of €361.0 million.

The Condat mill, located in Le Lardin St. Lazare, produces coated woodfree paper. The mill also operates a fully automated
finishing production line. From 1999 to 2003, as part of our capital improvement program, we invested a total of approximately
€158.3 million as follows: €109.1 million for major paper machine rebuilds, €22.1 million for cost reduction and productivity
improvements, €11.9 million for maintenance costs, €4.9 million for information technology improvements and €10.3 million for
environmental and safety improvements. Our investments in the Condat mill during 2004 and 2005 totaled €31.2 million.

Condat previously operated, and continues to own, three landfills near the Condat mill.

**Spain**

We acquired Torraspapel in December 1999 from Grupo Torras, a subsidiary of the Kuwait Investment Office. Torraspapel’s
paper manufacturing operations date from the early 1700s and in 1986 the Kuwait Investment Office gained control of Torraspapel.

Torraspapel has an annual coated woodfree paper production capacity of 630,000 metric tons and a specialty paper production
capacity of 243,000 metric tons. Total sales for Torraspapel’s coated woodfree paper in the year ended December 31, 2005 were
547,000 metric tons, generating revenues of €426.6 million, and total sales for its specialty papers in the year ended December 31,
2005 were 220,500 metric tons, generating revenues of €270.3 million. From 1999 to 2003, as part of our capital improvement
program, we invested a total of approximately €273.7 million as follows: €151.8 million for major paper machine rebuilds, €51.2
million for cost reduction and productivity improvements, €29.7 million for maintenance costs, €25.3 million for information
technology improvements and €15.7 million for environment and safety improvements. Our investments in our Spanish mills during
2004 and 2005 totaled €55.6 million.

**_Torraspapel’s Paper Mills_**

   - **Algeciras. Torraspapel’s mill in Algeciras produces one-sided coated paper and base paper. The mill has an annual production**
capacity of 50,000 metric tons.

-----

   - **Leitza. Torraspapel’s mill in Leitza operates as a converting facility to convert base paper to carbonless, metallized, thermal**
and cast-coated papers. The mill has an annual converting capacity of 148,000 metric tons.

   - **Motril. Torraspapel’s mill in Motril produces coated woodfree paper. The mill has an annual production capacity of 230,000**
metric tons.

   - **St. Joan les Fonts. Torraspapel’s mill in St. Joan les Fonts produces coated woodfree paper. The mill has an annual production**
capacity of 145,000 metric tons.

   - **Sarria de Ter. Torraspapel’s mill in Sarria de Ter produces coated woodfree paper and uncoated paper. The mill has an**
annual production capacity of 110,000 metric tons of coated woodfree paper and 20,000 metric tons of uncoated paper.

   - **Zaragoza. Torraspapel’s paper mill in Zaragoza produces coated woodfree paper and base paper. The paper mill has an annual**
production capacity of 145,000 metric tons of coated woodfree paper and 30,000 metric tons of base paper.

**_Our Pulp Mill. Pulp is the primary raw material used in the production of our coated woodfree and specialty papers. At_**
Torraspapel’s paper mill in Zaragoza we operate a pulp mill, which began operations in 1977 and produces eucalyptus chemical pulp
on two production lines for use in our coated woodfree papermaking operations. The pulp mill produces 30% of the chemical pulp we
need to make our coated woodfree paper across all of our mills. All elements of the pulp mill were upgraded during the 1990s and we
do not expect the pulp mill to require any significant investment until 2010. The pulp mill has an annual production capacity of
230,000 metric tons.

Torraspapel operates and owns three landfills, one near our Leitza mill, one near our St. Joan les Fonts mill and one near St. Julia
des Ramis, where we previously operated a mill.

**Paper Distribution**

Through Torraspapel we act as a paper distributor in Spain, Portugal, France and Argentina. In the year ended December 31, 2005,
our paper distribution business sold approximately 430,000 metric tons of coated woodfree paper and specialty papers, of which 80%
was produced by Torraspapel and the remainder by other paper producers. Torraspapel’s distribution operations allow it to maintain a
close understanding of its customers’ product and service needs and to effectively develop and market new products to meet such
requirements. It also allows Torraspapel to more rapidly adjust production levels and product mix in response to market demand.

Torraspapel’s distribution business sells directly to a number of printers and publishers. The primary functions of the paper
distribution business involve buying paper from mills in large quantities and re- distributing the paper in smaller quantities with short
delivery times to printers, publishers and other customers. The business also involves marketing and promotion activities.

Torraspapel operates two different distributors based in Spain, one based in Portugal, one based in France and one based in
Argentina. These operations are geared toward different market segments and maintain separate sales forces and brands in order to
maximize the target market. Despite operating different distributors, to the extent possible, Torraspapel centralizes the warehouse,
logistics and overhead functions of its distribution business so as to minimize costs.

During the year ended December 31, 2005 and the nine months ended September 30, 2006, consolidated net sales by Torraspapel’s
distribution business of products produced by third parties were approximately €86.0 million and €67.7 million and accounted for
approximately €0.3 million and €0.9 million of our consolidated EBITDA, respectively.

**Raw Materials**

The principal raw materials used to manufacture our products are pulp, minerals and chemicals, energy, wood and water. We
believe we have adequate sources of the raw materials necessary to ensure there is no interruption to our required supply for the
foreseeable future.

The prices of raw materials are subject to commodity price fluctuations. Due to competitive pressures, the prices of our products
are not always correlated with increases and decreases in the cost of raw materials. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our

85


-----

Business—Product prices and raw material costs in our industry are volatile, and periods of low product prices or high raw material
costs negatively affect our profitability and cash flows.”

**_Pulp_**

Wood pulp is the principal raw material required to manufacture paper. Pulp is converted from wood by means of mechanical or
chemical processes. Chemical pulp, used to manufacture coated woodfree paper, is produced by cooking wood chips in solutions of
caustic chemicals to separate the cellulose fibers used for pulping. There are two main types of chemical pulp: long-fiber chemical
pulp, made of spruce or pine wood and used to manufacture paper requiring superior strength, such as magazine paper, and short-fiber
chemical pulp, made of birch, beech or eucalyptus wood and used to manufacture fine papers and boards. We primarily use short-fiber
chemical pulp.

In Spain, we operate a 230,000 metric ton eucalyptus pulp mill at our paper mill in Zaragoza, which produces pulp for our mills in
Spain. This pulp production represents approximately 30% of our overall pulp requirements for our coated woodfree papermaking
operations.

Pulp purchased from third parties is our most significant cost, amounting to €276.4 million, or 19.5% of our revenues, in the year
ended December 31, 2005. We purchase our pulp primarily from leading pulp producers in Europe and South America. We have
annual volume agreements with our pulp suppliers, with the prices we pay for pulp being determined in line with prevailing market
prices at the time we place orders with our suppliers. We believe our sources of pulp are sufficiently diversified as to ensure at all
times the pulp volumes necessary for our paper manufacturing operations. In the past, pulp prices have undergone significant
fluctuations. Pulp prices are highly volatile and sensitive to changes in industry capacity, producer inventories, demand for paper,
cyclical changes in the world economy and fluctuations in the U.S. dollar, the reference currency for trading. We do not engage in
hedging against fluctuations in the cost of pulp because we do not enter into long-term fixed price contracts for the sale of paper.

In general, our level of vertical pulp integration is low relative to many of the paper manufacturers with which we compete. A
number of our competitors have full or nearly full vertical pulp integration, where mills combine wood pulping production facilities
with paper production facilities. Full vertical pulp integration is intended to avoid sharp variations in the market price of pulp.
However, while full vertical pulp integration may help to stabilize costs, it does not necessarily stabilize earnings, as pulp costs remain
stable but finished goods prices will vary depending on what the market will bear. We have no plans to invest in additional pulp
capacity.

**_Minerals and Chemicals_**

In the year ended December 31, 2005, we spent approximately €202.5 million on the purchase of minerals and chemicals,
representing approximately 14.3% of our revenues. The essential minerals and chemicals we use for our paper manufacturing and
coating processes include latex, carbonates, starch and clay. We purchase these minerals and chemicals from leading producers in
Western Europe, North America and Brazil. We use a combination of open market purchases and short-term fixed price, short-term
variable price and framework agreements to acquire our minerals and chemicals. In recent years there has been a general increase in
the prices of most of the minerals and chemicals we purchase. We are not dependent on any single supplier for any of our mineral or
chemical requirements, and there is generally an adequate source of supply for these requirements.

**_Energy_**

Energy is a significant component of our production process and in the year ended December 31, 2005 accounted for
approximately 5.3% of our revenues. During 2005, the cost of gas and electricity from outside suppliers rose sharply. These increases
in prices were partially attributable to the dramatic rise in the price of oil and natural gas during this period. Energy and transportation
costs continued to increase throughout 2006. Furthermore, the implementation of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme in January 2005,
which implements the Kyoto Protocol in the countries in which our mills operate, may lead to further electricity and other energy price
increases. Our energy policy is to secure supplies of gas, steam and electricity that are reliable and cost-effective. In the year ended
December 31, 2005, our total consolidated and unconsolidated energy costs were €74.9 million.

Prices for electricity sold on the open market in Southern Europe are highly regulated, and therefore we do not hedge our
electricity costs. We operate cogeneration energy plants at six of our seven principal mills, and the cogeneration plants we operate,

86


-----

provide, and in many cases exceed, all of our energy needs at the mills where they are located. The cogeneration plants offer an
efficient way to meet our energy needs, as the excess heat generated through the production of electricity is used to make the steam we
need to run our production processes. The Garda mill obtains all of its electricity requirements from its own cogeneration plant. In
December 2006, Torraspapel acquired majority ownership of Cogeneración del Ter, S.L., a cogeneration facility in Sarria de Ter, in
which Torraspapel previously held 1% ownership. Torraspapel currently operates, directly or indirectly, five cogeneration plants at
Leitza, Motril, Zaragoza and Sarria de Ter that produce enough electricity to meet those mills’ annual needs. These plants also sell
excess electricity on the open market, which largely compensates for the electricity purchases made by the other Torraspapel mills.
Condat’s steam-driven power plant produces 25% of Condat’s annual electricity requirements, with Condat purchasing the remaining
75% via a multi-year, fixed price contract with a multi-national supplier.

We intend to replace the cogeneration facility we currently operate in Riva del Garda with a new plant that we are constructing
together with Alto Garda Servizi, the city-owned utility company, which will produce both steam and electricity. We expect to
complete the new facility during 2008. Garda will have 80% ownership of the plant, with Alto Garda Servizi owning the remaining
20%. We have received all necessary permits required to construct and operate the facility. Our financial projections indicate that the
new plant in Riva del Garda should increase Garda’s EBITDA by €10 million to €12 million per year.

We meet our gas requirements mostly through contracts with local gas suppliers. These contracts are a mix of fixed and variable
price contracts. Gas prices in Southern Europe are regulated and historically we have not hedged our gas costs. We may enter into
hedging arrangements for our gas requirements in the future if the benefits are deemed sufficient. Our steam requirements are met
primarily through production from the cogeneration plants we operate and also through a combination of long-term, variable price
contracts with local suppliers.

**_Wood_**

Wood purchases for our pulp mill accounted for approximately 3.1% of our revenues in the year ended December 31, 2005. Our
total wood consumption in the year ended December 31, 2005 was 645,345 cubic meters, at a total cost of approximately €44.3
million. We purchase our wood on the open market in Spain and Portugal at negotiated market prices. We are not dependent on any
one supplier for our wood requirements, and we believe our sources of wood are sufficiently diversified to ensure an adequate supply
at all times of our wood requirements. Wood prices have remained relatively stable in recent years.

**_Water_**

The production of pulp and paper requires significant quantities of water. All of our facilities are located in close proximity either
to sources of surface water, such as lakes and rivers, or to wells, and we believe we have access to sufficient supplies of water to meet
our operating requirements for the foreseeable future. Our access to water is dependent on governmental authorizations to operate our
mills. We pay taxes for the water we use in our production facilities.

Over the past few years we have substantially reduced our use of fresh water in our manufacturing processes, relying instead on
water we recycle internally. To improve the quality of the water we discharge into the environment, we have equipped all seven of our
principal mills with water treatment plants to remove suspended solids, such as pulp and mineral residues, from our returned water.
Our water treatment plants also reduce the amount of oxygen needed to break down organic compounds in effluents in our returned
water.

**Seasonality**

The demand for our products does not depend on the seasons in any material way.

**Intellectual Property and Research and Development**

We seek to protect our intellectual property rights in Italy, France and Spain and other markets. We own registered trademarks for
many of our products. We also hold various patents relating to our products and the processes for their production. In addition, we
have non-registered intellectual property rights, including trade secrets, proprietary technology, know-how and processes, many of
which are related to our manufacturing operations. Consistent with the industry in which we operate, our manufacturing operations are

87


-----

not dependent to a significant extent on our protected intellectual property rights. Although our intellectual property portfolio as a
whole is material, we do not believe that any individual intellectual property right or group of such rights is material to our business.

We also carry out various research and development activities, with the objective of proactively and continuously improving our
processes and products. Specific research and development activities include innovation and improvement of our bleaching, bulking,
chemical recovery, papermaking and coating processes and research regarding raw material use in our manufacturing processes. In the
year ended December 31, 2005 we spent approximately €6.4 million on research and development activities, representing
approximately 0.5% of our revenues.

**Loss Prevention and Insurance**

We believe that we maintain insurance coverage that reflects the risks, size and requirements of our business operations and that is
comparable to the insurance coverage maintained by other companies operating in the paper manufacturing industry. We currently
carry property, loss-of-profits, general liability, product liability, transportation, environmental impairment and management liability
insurance. In particular, we maintain insurance coverage for all of our properties and facilities and all of our properties and facilities
are valued at their reinstatement value. We also carry business interruption insurance that covers the full value of potential or realized
revenue loss resulting from major damage to our property. In addition, we participate in various governmental worker accident and
occupational health insurance programs. We believe that our employees have been insured at least to the extent required by the
respective local laws and regulations. On a consolidated basis, in the year ended December 31, 2005 the total amount we paid for
insurance premiums was approximately €5.1 million.

We believe that prevention, protection and employee training are key means of defending against loss from workplace incidents. In
2005 and 2006 we spent €8.4 million on various loss prevention initiatives. We also are in the process of certifying all our sites to
meet FM Global’s Highly Protected Risk standard, which will result in lower insurance premiums. The Condat mill already has
obtained this status.

**Employees**

As of December 31, 2005, we had a total of 4,673 employees as computed on a full-time equivalent basis. The majority of our staff
are involved in production.

We believe that we have good relations with our employees and their representatives. Substantially all of our employees are
represented by labor unions pursuant to collective bargaining agreements. We observe local practice and legislation in our labor
relations matters and in negotiating collective bargaining agreements.

Our employees participate in a defined contribution post-employment plan and a defined benefit post-employment plan. Our
employees do not participate in any equity-based compensation plan or share-based payment plan.

The report of our independent auditor as of and for the year ended December 31, 2005 contains a qualification due to the
requirement of International Accounting Standard 24 that compensation paid to key management personnel be disclosed. As described
in note 35.2 to our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2005, for confidentiality
reasons, we did not disclose compensation paid to key management personnel in our audited consolidated financial statements. For
purposes of this offering, we have disclosed the aggregate cost to us of remuneration received by members of the Lecta S.A. board of
directors during the year ended December 31, 2005. See “Management— Remuneration.”

**Environmental, Health and Safety Regulation**

**_Operation of Production Facilities_**

We operate in an industry that is subject to extensive environmental, health and safety regulation, including those pertaining to the
storage, handling, treatment, transportation and disposal of hazardous materials, the construction and operation of our mills (including
the noise impact of our operations), the protection of natural resources and endangered species, and our emissions and discharges of
pollutants to air and water. Environmental, health and safety standards applicable to us are established by the laws of the European
Union and the member states in which we operate, standards adopted by regulatory agencies and our permits and licenses, each of

which is subject to periodic and more stringent modifications and requirements. Violations of these laws, regulations or permits and
licenses may result in substantial fines and penalties and orders to cease the violating operations or to conduct or pay for corrective
works. In some instances, violations may also result in suspension or revocation of permits and licenses.

All of our mills have environmental management systems in place that are presently certified to the 14001 standard of the
International Organization for Standardization, and our Condat and Garda mills additionally obtained registration in 2005 of their
environmental management systems under the European Union’s Eco-Management and Audit Scheme, or EMAS. Nevertheless the
risk of environmental, health and safety infractions is inherent in our industry, and from time to time we have experienced noncompliance with such laws and regulations and may do so again in the future.

We invest substantial capital resources on environmental and safety compliance. During the nine months ended September 30,
2006, we spent €6.0 million on capital expenditures relating to environmental and safety compliance. We anticipate spending
approximately €12 million on such costs during the year ended December 31, 2006, compared with €10.5 million and €12.1 million
for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The most significant European Union laws that apply or are expected
to apply to our mills are the Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control, or IPPC, Directive, the Emissions Trading Scheme and laws
related to the Environmental Liability Directive.

_IPPC_

The IPPC Directive (96/61/EC), issued in 1996, requires each member state to unify its environmental licensing regime relating to
emissions of air, soil and water. The Directive contains several key policies, including the requirement that all emission and pollution
control measures be based on the best available techniques. The IPPC Directive has been implemented in France, Italy and Spain.
Most of our facilities in Spain are still in the process of being licensed under Spain’s IPPC licensing regime.

_Emissions Trading_

The Emissions Trading Scheme (2003/87/EC), which is part of the European Union’s efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions
in accordance with the Kyoto Protocol of 1997, became effective in January 2005. Pursuant to the national laws that implement this
Directive, the applicable regulator in each member state issues a greenhouse gas permit and a certain number of allowances for the
annual emission of carbon dioxide to installations that are subject to the scheme, which include the Condat and Garda mills and most
of our mills and cogeneration facilities in Spain. Actual carbon dioxide emissions from installations are then audited externally each
year to determine whether they meet, fall below or exceed the annual allowances. To the extent an installation’s carbon dioxide
emissions exceed its annual allowances it must make up for the shortfall by purchasing allowances. Alternatively, an installation
whose emissions fall below its annual allowances may sell its excess allowances, or “credits.”

We have had to make up for a shortfall of emissions allowances at some of our mills by purchasing or obtaining additional credits
from affiliates or third parties. We have continued to improve the efficiency of our production processes and our use of energy for
those processes, including through the increased use of electricity generated locally by cogeneration. In addition, in 2005 we
introduced the Lecta Energy Monitoring System, which is a benchmarking and process improvement effort designed to reduce our
energy consumption. Inasmuch as the impact of the Emissions Trading Scheme will depend on the continuing implementation
measures adopted by the member states in which we have production facilities, we are presently not in a position to assess the full
scope of the impact or the need, if any, for additional capital expenditures or other measures (such as purchasing allowances) to
comply with existing or anticipated greenhouse gas emissions limits. Based on present information, however, we do not expect the
further implementation of the Emissions Trading Scheme to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of
operations.

_Environmental Liability Directive_

The Directive on Environmental Liability with regard to the Prevention and Remedying of Environmental Damage (2004/35/EC),
or Environmental Liability Directive, aims to prevent and remedy pollution of water, damage to biodiversity and land contamination
that causes serious harm to human health. Operators of activities that cause environmental damage may be required to restore the
damage caused or to pay for the cleanup and restoration irrespective of their fault in causing the damage.

89


-----

In general, the existing legislation in France, Italy and Spain governing land or water contamination is as or more stringent than the
Environmental Liability Directive. These laws may impose liability on an owner or occupier of property for investigation and
remediation of soil or water contamination at or emanating from the property, regardless of who caused the contamination, when it
was caused and whether the hazardous material disposal activity that caused it was legal at the time. In Spain, Royal Decree 9/2005,
which was recently adopted, requires operators of paper mills and cogeneration plants such as ours to submit to the relevant authority
preliminary status reports on the condition of the soil at such facilities by February 2007. Depending on the nature and extent of
contamination identified in these reports, the authorities may require additional investigation or cleanup of the contamination.

Some of our properties are located on land with a long history of industrial use by us and other companies before us, which has
resulted in spills and other releases of hazardous materials over time. Consequently, we have incurred costs for the remediation of
land, soil or water contamination in the past. The limited testing for contamination that has taken place at certain of our facilities may
not be sufficient to ascertain the extent of our ongoing and future obligations with respect to contamination relating to our facilities.
For example, we previously operated three landfills in the vicinity of the Condat mill and, based on the testing conducted to date, it is
not possible to determine the nature and extent of contamination, if any, that will require remediation at two of them. We also operate
three landfills in Spain. These landfills, along with our presently and previously operated mills and cogeneration facilities in Spain,
may be the subject of additional requirements for investigation and cleanup of contamination as part of our compliance with Royal
Decree 9/2005. Consequently, we may in the future be subject to substantial costs and liabilities for investigation and remediation of
contamination.

**_Forestry and Wood and Pulp Procurement_**

Our procurement of wood and pulp strives to balance the economic, environmental and social aspects of sustainability. One
fundamental community objective in the European paper industry is to ensure that wood and pulp originate from sustainably managed
forests that ensure a long-term supply of the best wood quality products while maintaining and improving wildlife habitat and other
components of the forest ecosystem. The major types of endorsement programs for wood, pulp and paper originating from sustainably
managed forests are forestry certification schemes, certified products and chain of custody certifications.

We continue to work to gain acceptance and recognition of our wood and pulp procurement practices through these certification
schemes. We do not purchase wood or pulp that we know to originate from protected areas or areas in the process of designation for
protection, unless purchases are clearly in line with the relevant conservation regulations and goals. We do not purchase wood that we
know to be from old-growth forests.

**_Health and Safety Regulation and Liabilities_**

The pulp and paper industries involve inherently hazardous activities including, among other things, the operation of heavy
machinery. Each of Italy, France and Spain regulates health and safety in the workplace.

**Legal Proceedings**

We are party to pending legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. While the results of such proceedings cannot
be predicted with certainty, we do not believe any of these matters will be material to the business, financial condition or results of
operations of Lecta S.A., taken as a whole.

**CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED**
**PARTY TRANSACTIONS**

**Shareholders’ Agreement**

Each shareholder in Lecta S.A. has entered into an Amended and Restated Shareholders’ Agreement dated December 10, 1999, as
amended and restated on each of June 20, 2000, December 13, 2002 and October 22, 2003. The Shareholders’ Agreement governs

**DESCRIPTION OF OTHER INDEBTEDNESS**

_The following summary of our significant indebtedness does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its_
_entirety by, the underlying documents._

**Overview**

The following table summarizes our contractual obligations and principal payments as of September 30, 2006 under debt
instruments and capital leases on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Refinancing. The information in the table below reflects
our estimates of the contractual maturities of obligations. These obligations may differ significantly from the actual maturity of these
obligations.

**Less than** **More than**
**Total** **1 year** **1 year**
RCF................................... 0.0 0.0 0.0
Notes ................................. 748.0 0.0 748.0
Other debt.......................... 10.3 2.7 7.6
Capital lease obligations ... 2.2 1.0 1.2
Bank overdrafts................. 5.4 5.4 0.0

**The Existing Credit Facilities**

In March 2001 an umbrella agreement was entered into to provide senior term, revolving, working capital and ancillary facilities to
Lecta S.A. and various of its subsidiaries to, inter alia, refinance existing debt of the group and pay related fees and expenses (the
“Existing Credit Facilities”). The umbrella agreement brought together under a single agreement certain existing indebtedness of
various subsidiaries, which was documented under separate local law governed facility agreements. In connection with the
Refinancing, our Existing Credit Facilities will be terminated and all amounts under such facilities will be repaid and all security
granted pursuant to which will be released.

**Existing Receivables Factoring**

In 2000, Cartiere del Garda S.p.A. (“Garda”) entered into a receivables factoring arrangement (the “Existing Receivables
Factoring”) to improve cash flow and finance working capital. Garda’s Existing Receivables Factoring will remain in place after the
Refinancing.

The Existing Receivables Factoring provides two financial facilities: (i) an invoice discounting arrangement and (ii) a cash
advance on assigned receivables, in each case based on non-notification clauses. The invoice discounting arrangement provides for the
assignment of invoices to a factor, and the factor pays to Garda the discounted amount based on the interest rate, par value and due
date of the receivable. Garda is entitled to collect payments directly from its customers pursuant to a cash warrant clause, and
immediately upon collecting payments from its customers, Garda transfers the relevant amounts to the factor acting as agent. As of
September 30, 2006, the invoice discounting arrangement amounted to €46.2 million.

The second facility, the cash advance on assigned receivables, provides Garda with an interest-bearing cash advance on nondiscounted assigned receivables and entitles Garda to collect payments directly from its customers. As of September 30, 2006, this
second facility amounted to €5.2 million. In 2006, Torraspapel Italia S.r.L. entered into a similar arrangement to provide a cash
advance on assigned receivables. On September 30, 2006, Torraspapel Italia S.r.L’s cash advance arrangement amounted to €2.9
million.

The Existing Receivables Factoring includes customary representations and warranties and provisions as to confidentiality, and is
governed by Italian law. The Existing Receivables Factoring is renewable on a yearly basis. Prior written notice of termination is
required.

96


-----

**Senior Revolving Credit Facility**

As part of the Refinancing, on or around the date of the issue of the Notes, Lecta S.A., Sub Lecta 1 S.A., Sub Lecta 2 S.A., Condat
Holding S.A., Condat S.A.S., Torraspapel Holding S.A., Torraspapel S.A., Sarriopapel y Celulosa S.A. and Cartiere del Garda S.p.A.
(as original borrowers and guarantors), will enter into an RCF between themselves and, among others, Deutsche Bank AG, London
Branch (as Arranger, Facility Agent, original Issuing Bank and Security Trustee) and the lenders under the RCF. The RCF provides
for a €60 million committed credit facility and up to a €15 million uncommitted credit facility. Debt incurred under the RCF will rank
pari passu with the Notes.

_Interest and maturity_

The loans under the RCF will bear interest at EURIBOR (or LIBOR, as applicable) plus a margin of 2.0% per annum (plus the
mandatory cost, if any) payable on the last day of each applicable interest period (as determined in accordance with the terms of the
RCF), provided that on September 1, 2007 and at the end of each quarter thereafter the margin will fluctuate with and be tied to our
ratio of total net debt to EBITDA (as defined in the RCF) at a rate per annum between 1.50% and 2.00%. The lower margin will be
applicable if our ratio of total net debt to EBITDA is equal to or less than 2.00:1 while the higher margin will be applicable if our ratio
of total net debt to EBITDA is greater than or equal to 2.50:1.

The termination date of the RCF is in February 2013.

_Covenants and Events of Default_

The RCF contains certain restrictive covenants and events of default which, subject to conforming amendments, reflect the
covenants and events of default contained in the Notes. The RCF also contains certain customary representations and warranties for
facilities of this type.

_Security and Guarantees_

Our obligations under the RCF will be secured by a first priority interest in enforcement proceeds, subject to such limited
exceptions as described in the Notes, over substantially the same assets as those securing the Notes. Guarantees, subject to certain
limitations in relation to unlawful financial assistance or which would result in directors or officers acting in contravention of their
fiduciary duties and/or would subject them to civil or criminal or personal liability as a result of providing such guarantees, will be
provided by Lecta S.A., Sub Lecta 1 S.A., Sub Lecta 2 S.A., Condat Holding S.A., Condat S.A.S., Torraspapel Holding S.A.,
Torraspapel S.A., Sarriopapel y Celulosa S.A. and Cartiere del Garda S.p.A.

_Voluntary Prepayments_

Lecta S.A. has the option to voluntarily prepay all or part of the RCF in tranches of at least €250,000 with five business days’
notice for each of cancellation and prepayments. Lecta S.A. has the option to voluntarily prepay an individual lender in the event that
any sum payable to that lender is required to be increased due to a tax gross-up or indemnification or where increased costs are
payable in certain circumstances.

_Mandatory Prepayments_

Mandatory prepayment and cancellation of the RCF will occur upon (i) certain change of control events and a sale of substantially
all of our assets or (ii) it being illegal for a lender to provide or continue to provide funding (such prepayment will be limited to such
lender’s share). In the case of any voluntary prepayment or mandatory prepayment (other than (ii) above), Lecta S.A. would be
required to pay break costs.

**Intercreditor Agreement**

To establish the relative rights of certain of our creditors under our financing arrangements, Lecta S.A., Sub Lecta 1 S.A., Sub
Lecta 2 S.A., Cartiere del Garda S.p.A., Condat Holding S.A., Condat S.A.S., Torraspapel Holding S.A., Torraspapel S.A. and
Sarriopapel y Celulosa S.A. (the “Obligors”) will enter into an intercreditor agreement (the “Intercreditor Agreement”) with, among

97


-----

others, the lenders under the RCF, certain hedging counterparties, the Secured Notes Trustee and the Security Trustee (in its capacity
as Security Trustee). By accepting a Secured Note, holders of Secured Notes will be deemed to have agreed to, and accepted the terms
and conditions of, the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Intercreditor Agreement sets out:

   - the relative ranking of certain debt of Lecta S.A. and certain of its subsidiaries;

   - the relative ranking of transaction security granted by Lecta S.A. and certain of its subsidiaries;

   - certain provisions concerning enforcement action that can be taken in respect of that debt;

   - the procedure of enforcement of transaction security and the allocation of payments pursuant to such enforcement;

   - the terms pursuant to which certain intercompany debt will be subordinated upon the occurrence of certain insolvency events;
and

   - turnover provisions.

The following description is a summary of certain provisions contained in the Intercreditor Agreement. It does not restate the
Intercreditor Agreement in its entirety and, as such, we urge you to read that document because it, and not the discussion that follows,
defines certain rights (and restrictions on entitlement) of the holders of the Notes.

**_Priority of debts_**

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that outstanding RCF debt (including the guarantees thereof), hedging debt, the Secured
Notes, the Secured Note Guarantees and the Intercompany Loans will rank, without any preference between them, in priority to any
intercompany loans (other than the Intercompany Loans).

**_Enforcement of security_**

The holders of the Secured Notes may not enforce the transaction security. Enforcement with respect to the transaction security
may only be taken by the Security Trustee upon the instruction of the RCF facility agent, the Secured Notes Trustee, or hedging
counterparties.

The Security Trustee may refrain from enforcing the relevant transaction security unless instructed otherwise by the Secured Notes
Trustee.

The Security Trustee may disregard any instructions from any other person to enforce the transaction security and may disregard
instructions to enforce any transaction security if those instructions are inconsistent with the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Intercreditor Agreement also contains procedures with respect to the prior consultation between the secured parties in
connection with the enforcement of transaction security and coordination of instructions from the RCF facility agent and the Secured
Notes Trustee. If the instructions given to the Security Trustee by the RCF facility agent conflict with the instructions given by the
Secured Notes Trustee and such conflict is not resolved, the Security Trustee will enforce the transaction security in accordance with
the instructions of the Secured Notes Trustee.

Subject to applicable law and to the rights of any person with prior security or prior claims, the proceeds of enforcement of the
transaction security shall be paid to the Security Trustee for application as described below.

The Secured Notes Trustee shall only be obliged to instruct the Security Trustee to enforce the transaction security where it has
been directed to do so by the holders of the Secured Notes and required to do so under the terms of the Secured Indenture (having
regard to its entitlement to be indemnified before giving any such instruction).

98


-----

The proceeds of enforcement of any transaction security and all other amounts paid to the Security Trustee under the Intercreditor
Agreement shall be applied in the following order:

   - first, in payment pari passu and pro rata (i) of the fees, costs, expenses and liabilities (and all interest thereon) of the RCF
facility agent, the Security Trustee, and any receiver, attorney or agent appointed under the security documents or the
Intercreditor Agreement and (ii) owing to the Secured Notes Trustee in respect of Trustee Amounts (as defined below);

   - second, in payment pari passu and pro rata of unpaid costs and expenses of the RCF facility agent and any other finance party
under the RCF and the hedging contracts;

   - third, in payment to the RCF facility agent and the hedging counterparties for application towards the balance of the RCF and
the hedging debt pari passu and pro rata between such creditors;

   - fourth, in payment to the Secured Notes Trustee for application towards the balance of the Secured Notes and the Secured
Guarantees; and

   - fifth, in payment of the surplus (if any) to the obligors or other persons entitled to it for intercompany liabilities.

We, the finance parties under the RCF, the creditors under the Secured Notes and the hedging providers have granted authority
under the Intercreditor Agreement to the Security Trustee to release the guarantees, and as applicable, security in accordance with the
Intercreditor Agreement and the relevant finance documents.

“Trustee Amounts” means the fees, costs and expenses of the Secured Notes Trustee (including any amount payable to that
Secured Notes Trustee personally by way of indemnity, remuneration or to reimburse it for expenses incurred) payable for its own
account pursuant to the Secured Notes documents in respect of the ongoing day-to-day administration of the Secured Notes documents
and related documents and the costs of any Enforcement Action (as defined) (including legal and other professional advisory fees)
which are recoverable pursuant to the terms of the Secured Indenture and related documents (including the Secured Note Guarantees)
or any other document entered into in connection with the issuance of the Secured Notes.

**_Intercompany debt_**

Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, Lecta S.A. and its subsidiaries party thereto have agreed to subordinate intercompany
debt (other than the Intercompany Loans) to debt under the RCF, the Secured Notes and hedging debt and related guarantees.

In addition, neither Lecta S.A. nor any of its subsidiaries may accept the benefit of any security, guarantee, indemnity or other
assurance against financial loss (other than under the transaction security) or make payments on or otherwise acquire or satisfy any
intercompany loans (other than Intercompany Loans) other than certain payments (i) to enable a company which is a borrower or
guarantor to pay amounts under the RCF, hedging debt or under the Secured Notes or the Unsecured Notes or (ii) made prior to the
taking of Enforcement Action or which is permitted under the RCF, the Notes and the hedging documentation or (iii) made with the
consent of the Secured Notes Trustee and the RCF facility agent.

**_Turnover_**

If any secured creditor (defined in the Intercreditor Agreement as the Secured Notes Trustee on behalf of the holders of the
Secured Notes, the Security Trustee, the RCF lenders, the RCF facility agent and the hedging counterparties or any receiver or
delegate) or Lecta S.A. or any of its subsidiaries receives or recovers a payment in contravention of the Intercreditor Agreement, it
shall hold such payment in trust and pay over such amounts to the Security Trustee for application in accordance with the provision
described above under “—Enforcement of Security.”

A copy of the Intercreditor Agreement shall be made available for inspection during normal business hours on any business day
upon prior written request at the offices of the Secured Notes Trustee and, for so long as any Secured Notes are listed on the Official
List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, at the offices of the Paying
Agent in Luxembourg.

**DESCRIPTION OF THE SECURED NOTES**

Lecta S.A. will issue the Secured Notes under an indenture (the “Secured Indenture”) dated February 13, 2007 among itself, the
Secured Note Guarantors, Deutsche Trustee Company Limited, as trustee for the holders of the Secured Notes (the “Secured Notes
Trustee”), Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, as security trustee (the “Security Trustee”), and other parties named therein. The terms
of the Secured Notes are stated in the Secured Indenture. The Secured Notes will be denominated in euro and bear interest with
reference to EURIBOR as described below. The Secured Indenture is unlimited in aggregate principal amount, although the issuance
of Secured Notes on the Issue Date (as defined below) will be limited to €598.0 million.

Certain terms used in this description are defined under the heading “—Certain definitions.” In this description of the Secured
Notes: (i) the “Company” refers only to Lecta S.A. and not to any of its Subsidiaries; and (ii) “Secured Note Guarantor” refers only to
such Secured Note Guarantor and not to any of its Subsidiaries.

The following description is only a summary of the material provisions of the Secured Indenture. It does not restate the Secured
Indenture in its entirety. You should read the Secured Indenture because it, not this description, defines your rights as Holders. You
may request copies of the Secured Indenture at the address set forth under the heading “Where you can find more information” and,
for so long as Secured Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the rules of the Luxembourg Stock
Exchange so require, may inspect copies of such documents at the office of the paying agent in Luxembourg.

**Brief description of the Secured Notes**

The Secured Notes:

   - will be senior secured obligations of the Company;

   - will rank _pari passu_ in right of payment with all existing and future Debt of the Company that is not subordinated to the
Secured Notes;

   - will rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future Subordinated Obligations of the Company;

   - will be structurally subordinated to all liabilities (including trade payables), disqualified stock and preferred stock of the
Company’s Subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Secured Notes; and

   - will benefit from additional credit enhancement provided by certain Subsidiaries of the Company.

Credit enhancement for the Secured Notes will include (i) guarantees of the Secured Notes by certain Subsidiaries of the
Company; (ii) the pledge to the Security Trustee of the Intercompany Loans (as defined below) (other than the Intercompany Loans by
Condat Holding to Condat); and (iii) the pledge by Condat Holding to the Company of the Intercompany Loans it has made to Condat,
the rights under which the Company will in turn pledge to the Security Trustee to secure its obligations under the Secured Notes.

The guarantees of the Secured Notes by Subsidiaries of the Company will be secured in some, but not all, instances by certain
assets of the Subsidiary issuing such guarantee. Only some of the Subsidiaries of the Company will guarantee the Secured Notes, and
most of those guarantees are subject to significant limitations.

The Secured Notes Proceeds Loans (as defined below) from Lecta to Condat Holding and from Condat Holding to Condat (the
“French Secured Notes Proceeds Loans”) will be secured by certain of the assets of Condat Holding and Condat, respectively.

The credit enhancement for the Secured Notes is more fully described below under “—Credit enhancement” and in Annex A to
this listing memorandum.

Condat Holding and Condat are borrowers or guarantors under the Revolving Credit Facility but are not Secured Note Guarantors.
As a result, lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility may be able to assert claims for repayment against such Subsidiaries with
respect to which Holders of the Secured Notes would have no direct claims for repayment. However, lenders under the Revolving

100


-----

Credit Facility, the Secured Notes Trustee, and certain other parties have signed the Intercreditor Agreement which effectively makes
rights to repayment under the Revolving Credit Facility and the Secured Notes _pari passu, subject to lenders under the Revolving_
Credit Facility being entitled to priority with respect to proceeds from the sale of Collateral (as defined below) (see “Description of
other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement”).

As of the date of the Secured Indenture, all of the Company’s Subsidiaries will be “Restricted Subsidiaries.” However, under the
circumstances described below under the definition of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, the Company will be permitted to designate certain
of its Subsidiaries as “Unrestricted Subsidiaries.” Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants in the
Secured Indenture. Those of the Company’s Subsidiaries that are Secured Note Guarantors are all Restricted Subsidiaries and, subject
in each case to significant limitations under applicable law (as more specifically set out below under “—Credit enhancement—
Secured Note Guarantees”), will be jointly and severally liable with respect to the Company’s obligations under the Secured Notes.

The Company is a holding company with limited assets and operates its business through its Subsidiaries. Any right of the
Company and its creditors, including Holders of the Secured Notes, to participate in the assets of any of the Company’s Subsidiaries
(other than through the French Secured Notes Proceeds Loans to the extent of the assets securing such loans) that is not a Secured
Note Guarantor upon the bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization of any such Subsidiary will (except insofar as the Company has a
claim against such Subsidiary for intercompany debt) be subject to the prior claims of the creditors of such Subsidiary, including but
not limited to trade creditors. Claims by the Secured Notes Trustee against a Secured Note Guarantor on behalf of the Holders of the
Secured Notes will be direct claims on that Secured Note Guarantor. However, some of the Secured Note Guarantors are themselves
holding companies, and hence claims under a Secured Note Guarantee will be structurally subordinated to the prior claims of the
creditors of the Subsidiaries of such Secured Note Guarantors, including but not limited to trade creditors.

**Principal, Maturity and Interest**

The Company will issue the Secured Notes in an initial aggregate principal amount of €598.0 million. The Company will issue the
Secured Notes in denominations of €50,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 above €50,000. Secured Notes in denominations of less
than €50,000 will not be available. The Secured Notes will mature on February 15, 2014 at a redemption price of 100%. Subject to the
Company’s compliance with the covenant described under the heading “—Certain covenants—Limitation on Debt,” the Company is
permitted to issue additional notes from time to time under the Secured Indenture in an unlimited principal amount (the “Additional
Secured Notes”). The Secured Notes and the Additional Secured Notes, if any, will be treated as a single class for all purposes of the
Secured Indenture, including waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase. Unless the context otherwise requires, for all
purposes of the Secured Indenture and this description of the Secured Notes, references to the Secured Notes include any Additional
Secured Notes actually issued.

The Secured Notes will bear interest at a rate per annum (the “Applicable Rate”), reset quarterly, equal to EURIBOR plus 262.5
bps as determined by the calculation agent for the Secured Notes (the “Calculation Agent”), which will initially be Deutsche Bank
AG, London Branch, or any successor thereof.

Interest on the Secured Notes will be payable quarterly in arrears on each Interest Payment Date commencing May 15, 2007, to the
person in whose name the Secured Note is registered on the relevant Record Date. Interest on the Secured Notes will accrue from the
most recent date to which interest has been paid or, if no interest has been paid, from and including the Issue Date.

_“Determination Date” with respect to an Interest Period will be the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days preceding the first_
day of such Interest Period.

_“EURIBOR,” with respect to an Interest Period, will be the rate (expressed as a percentage per annum) for deposits in euro for a_
three-month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days after the Determination Date that appears on Telerate
Page 248 as of 11:00 a.m., Brussels time, on the Determination Date. If Telerate Page 248 does not include such a rate or is
unavailable on a Determination Date, the Calculation Agent will request the principal London office of each of four major banks in the
Euro- zone inter-bank market, as selected by the Calculation Agent, to provide such bank’s offered quotation (expressed as a
percentage per annum) as of approximately 11:00 a.m., Brussels time, on such Determination Date, to prime banks in the Euro-zone
inter-bank market for deposits in a Representative Amount in euro for a three-month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET
Settlement Days after the Determination Date. If at least two such offered quotations are so provided, the rate for the Interest Period
will be the arithmetic mean of such quotations. If fewer than two such quotations are so provided, the Calculation Agent will request

101


-----

each of three major banks in London, as selected by the Calculation Agent, to provide such bank’s rate (expressed as a percentage per
annum), as of approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on such Determination Date, for loans in a Representative Amount in euro to
leading European banks for a three-month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days after the Determination
Date. If at least two such rates are so provided, the rate for the Interest Period will be the arithmetic mean of such rates. If fewer than
two such rates are so provided then the rate for the Interest Period will be the rate in effect with respect to the immediately preceding
Interest Period.

_“Euro-zone” means the region comprised of member states of the European Union that adopt the euro._

_“Interest Payment Date” means February 15, May 15, August 15, and November 15 in each year from and including May 15,_
2007. If any Interest Payment Date would otherwise fall on a day which is not a Business Day, it shall be postponed to the next day
which is a Business Day unless it would then fall into the next calendar month, in which event, the Interest Payment Date shall be
brought forward to the immediately preceding Business Day.

_“Interest Period” means each successive period commencing on, and including, an Interest Payment Date and ending on, but_
excluding, the next succeeding Interest Payment Date, with the exception that the first Interest Period will commence on, and include,
the Issue Date and end on, but exclude, May 15, 2007 and the final Interest Period shall end on, but exclude, the date of final maturity.

_“Representative Amount” means the greater of (a) €1,000,000 and (b) an amount that is representative for a single transaction in_
the relevant market at the relevant time.

_“TARGET Settlement Day” means any day on which the Trans-European Automated Real-Time Gross Settlement Express_
Transfer (TARGET) System is open.

_“Telerate Page 248” means, the display page so designated on Bridge’s Telerate Service (or such other page as may replace that_
page on that service, or such other service as may be nominated as the information vendor).

The Calculation Agent will, as soon as practicable after 11:00 a.m. (Brussels time) or the Quotation Time (as the case may be) on
each Determination Date, determine the Applicable Rate, and calculate the aggregate amount of interest payable on the Secured Notes
in respect of the following Interest Period (the “Interest Amount”). The Interest Amount will be calculated by applying the Applicable
Rate to the principal amount of Secured Notes outstanding at the commencement of the Interest Period, multiplying each such amount
by the actual number of days in the Interest Period concerned divided by 360.

All percentages resulting from any of the above calculations will be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one hundred thousandth
of a percentage point, with five one-millionths of a percentage point being rounded upwards (e.g., 4.876545% (or .04876545) being
rounded to 4.87655% (or .0487655)). All euro amounts used in or resulting from such calculations will be rounded to the nearest euro
cent (with one-half euro cent being rounded upwards). The determination of the Applicable Rate and the Interest Amount by the
Calculation Agent shall, in the absence of willful default, bad faith or manifest error, be binding on all parties.

The interest rate on the Secured Notes will in no event be higher than the maximum rate permitted by New York law as the same
may be modified by any United States law of general application.

Upon each determination of interest rate, so long as the Secured Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock
Exchange and admitted for trading on the Euro MTF Market of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, to the extent required by the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange, the Company will inform Holders thereof through the relevant clearing systems and will make such
determination available during normal business hours at the offices of the paying agent in Luxembourg. The Calculation Agent will,
upon the request of the Holder of any Secured Note, provide the interest rate then in effect with respect to the Secured Notes.

The rights of Holders of beneficial interests in the Secured Notes to receive the payments of interest on the Secured Notes are
subject to applicable procedures of the book-entry depositary and Euroclear and Clearstream.

102


-----

**Optional redemption**

The Secured Notes will not be redeemable at the option of the Company prior to February 15, 2008, except as described in “—
Optional tax redemption.” On and after such date, the Secured Notes will be redeemable at the option of the Company, at any time as
a whole, or from time to time in part, on not less than 30 nor more than 60 days’ notice delivered to each Holder in accordance with
the provisions set forth under “—Notices,” at the following redemption prices (expressed as percentages of principal amount), plus
accrued and unpaid interest (if any) to the redemption date, if redeemed during the 12-month period commencing on February 15 of
the years set forth below:

**Redemption**
**Year** **Price**
2008........................... 101.0%
2009 and thereafter.... 100.0%

The Company may acquire Secured Notes by means other than a redemption, whether by tender offer, open market purchases,
negotiated transactions or otherwise, in accordance with applicable securities laws, so long as such acquisition does not otherwise
violate the terms of the Secured Indenture.

**Selection and notice of redemption**

If less than all the Secured Notes are to be redeemed, the particular Secured Notes to be redeemed will be selected not more than
60 days prior to the redemption date by the Secured Notes Trustee on a pro rata basis, by lot or by such method as the Secured Notes
Trustee will deem fair and appropriate or in such manner as complies with the requirements of the principal securities exchange, if
any, on which the Secured Notes being redeemed are listed and the requirements of any depositary holding the global certificates
representing the Secured Notes; provided however, that no Secured Note of €50,000 in original principal shall be redeemed in part.

If any Secured Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that Secured Note will state the portion
of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. The Company will issue a new Secured Note in a principal amount equal to the
unredeemed portion of the original Secured Note in the name of the Holder upon cancellation of the original Secured Note.

Subject to the terms of the applicable redemption notice, Secured Notes called for redemption become due on the date fixed for
redemption. On and after the redemption date, interest will cease to accrue on the Secured Notes or portions thereof called for
redemption (unless the Company defaults in providing the funds for such redemption) and such Secured Notes will cease to be
outstanding.

So long as any Secured Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted to trading on the
Euro MTF Market of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, the Company
will provide a copy of all notices to the Luxembourg Stock Exchange.

**Sinking Fund**

The Company is not required to make mandatory sinking fund payments with respect to the Secured Notes.

**Additional Amounts**

The Company and each Secured Note Guarantor is required to make all payments under or with respect to the Secured Notes or its
Secured Note Guarantee free and clear of and without withholding or deduction for or on account of any present or future tax, duty,
levy, impost, assessment or other governmental charge of whatever nature (including penalties, interest and other liabilities related
thereto) (hereinafter “Taxes”), unless the withholding or deduction is required by law.

If any deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of (1) the government of any of
the countries in which any of the Company or the relevant Secured Note Guarantor and, in each case, any successor thereof (each, a
“Payor”) is organized or any political subdivision or any authority or agency therein or thereof having power to tax, (2) any other
jurisdiction in which a Payor is otherwise resident for tax purposes, or (3) any jurisdiction from or through which any payment under

103


-----

or with respect to the Secured Notes or any Secured Note Guarantee is made (each, a “Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction”) will at any time
be required from any payment made under or with respect to the Secured Notes or a Secured Note Guarantee, as applicable, such
Payor will be required to pay such additional amounts (“Additional Amounts”) as may be necessary so that the net amount received in
respect of such payments by any Holder after such withholding or deduction (including any such deduction or withholding from such
Additional Amounts) will equal the amount such Holder would have received if such Taxes had not been withheld or deducted;
_provided, however, that the foregoing obligation to pay Additional Amounts does not apply to (1) any Taxes that would not have been_
imposed but for the existence of any present or former connection between the relevant Holder (or between a fiduciary, settlor,
beneficiary, member or shareholder of, or possessor of power over, the relevant Holder, if the relevant Holder is an estate, nominee,
partnership, limited liability corporation, trust or corporation) and the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction, including such Holder (or such
fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, partner, member, shareholder, or possessor) of the Secured Notes being or having been a citizen,
resident, or national thereof or being or having been present or engaged in a trade or business therein or having or having had a
permanent establishment therein, other than a connection resulting from the mere receipt of such payment or the ownership, holding or
enforcement of such Secured Note; (2) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, excise, transfer, personal property tax or similar Tax; (3) any
withholding or deduction in respect of the Secured Notes or any Secured Note Guarantee (a) where such withholding or deduction is
imposed on a payment or an individual and is required to be made pursuant to European Council Directive 2003/48/EC or any other
Directive implementing the conclusions of the ECOFIN Council meeting of 26th-27th November 2000 on the taxation of savings
income or any law implementing or complying with, or introduced in order to conform to, such Directive, or (b) presented (where
presentation is required) for payment by or on behalf of a Holder who would have been able to avoid such withholding or deduction
by presenting the Secured Notes to any other paying agent in a European Union Member State, or (c) where the payment could have
been made without such deduction or withholding if the Secured Notes had been presented for payment (where presentation is
required) within 30 days (i) after the date on which such payment became due and payable, or (ii) the date on which payment thereof
is duly provided for, whichever is later (except to the extent that the Holder would have been entitled to Additional Amounts had the
Secured Notes been presented during such 30-day period); (4) any Taxes imposed with respect to any payment of principal of (or
premium, if any, on) or interest on the Secured Notes by a Payor to any Holder who is a fiduciary or partnership or any Person other
than the sole beneficial owner of such payment, to the extent that a beneficiary or settlor with respect to such fiduciary, a member of
such a partnership or the beneficial owner of such payment would not have been entitled to the Additional Amounts had such
beneficiary, settlor, member or beneficial owner been the actual Holder of such Secured Notes; (5) any Taxes that are payable other
than by deduction or withholding from payments made under or with respect to the Secured Notes; (6) any Taxes that would not have
been imposed but for the failure of the Holder and/or beneficial owner to comply with the Payor’s or the paying agent’s reasonable
and timely request in accordance with the “—Notices” provision herein, to the Holder to provide certification, documentation,
information or other evidence concerning the nationality, residence, identity or connection with the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction of
the Holder and/or beneficial owner of such Secured Notes or to make any valid or timely declaration or similar claim or satisfy any
other reporting requirement relating to such matters, whether required or imposed by statute, treaty, regulation or administrative
practice of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction, as a precondition to exemption from, or reduction in the rate of withholding or deduction
of, Taxes imposed by the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction; or (7) any combination of any of the above.

Such Additional Amounts also will not be payable where, had the beneficial owner of the Secured Note been the Holder, it would
not have been entitled to payment of Additional Amounts by reason of clauses (1) to (7) inclusive above.

The Payor will (i) make any required withholding or deduction and (ii) remit the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant
Taxing Jurisdiction in accordance with applicable law. The Payor will use all reasonable efforts to provide the Secured Notes Trustee
with certified copies of tax receipts (or, if such certified copies are not available using all reasonable efforts, such other evidence
reasonably acceptable to the Secured Notes Trustee in its discretion), evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld
from each Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes. The Payor will attach to each certified copy (or other documentation) a
certificate stating (x) that the amount of such Tax evidenced by the certified copy (or other documentation) was paid in connection
with payments in respect of the principal amount of Secured Notes then outstanding and (y) the amount of such Tax paid per €1,000 of
principal amount of the Secured Notes.

At least 30 days prior to each date on which any payment under or with respect to the Secured Notes or any Secured Note
Guarantee, as the case may be, is due and payable (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises shortly before or after the
30th day prior to such date, in which case it shall be promptly thereafter), if the Payor will be obligated to pay Additional Amounts
with respect to such payment, the Payor will deliver to the Secured Notes Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that such
Additional Amounts will be payable and the amounts so payable and will set forth such other information necessary to enable the

104


-----

Secured Notes Trustee to pay such Additional Amounts to Holders of Secured Notes on the payment date. Each such Officer’s
Certificate shall be relied upon until receipt of a further Officer’s Certificate addressing such matters.

Whenever in the Secured Indenture there is mentioned, in any context:

(1) the payment of principal;

(2) redemption prices or purchase prices in connection with a redemption or purchase of Secured Notes;

(3) interest; or

(4) any other amount payable on or with respect to any of the Secured Notes,

such reference will be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts as described under this heading to the extent that, in such
context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.

The Company will pay any present or future stamp, court or documentary taxes or any other excise or property taxes (other than
net wealth taxes or similar taxes imposed on the Holder irrespective of such Holder’s investment in the Secured Notes and based on
the total net value of the Holder’s property), charge or similar levies that arise in any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction from the execution,
delivery, enforcement or registration of the Secured Notes, the Secured Note Guarantees, the Secured Indenture or any other document
or instrument in relation thereto (other than a transfer of the Secured Notes).

The obligations described under this heading will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Secured Indenture or any
Secured Note Guarantee.

**Optional tax redemption**

The Company is entitled to redeem the Secured Notes in whole, but not in part, at its option, at any time, upon not less than 30 nor
more than 60 days’ notice (which notice shall be irrevocable), at 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid
interest to the date of redemption (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the
relevant Interest Payment Date), in the event the Company or Secured Note Guarantor (as the case may be) has become or would
become obligated to pay, on the next date on which any amount would be payable with respect to the Secured Notes, Additional
Amounts as a result of:

(1) a change in or an amendment to the laws (including any regulations promulgated thereunder) of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction
affecting taxation; or

(2) any change in or amendment to any official position regarding the application or interpretation of such laws or regulations
(each of (1) and (2) a “Change in Tax Laws”),

which change or amendment becomes effective on or after the date hereof and the Company or Secured Note Guarantor (as the case
may be) cannot avoid such obligation by taking reasonable measures available to it.

No such notice of redemption may be given earlier than 90 days prior to the earliest date on which the Company or Secured Note
Guarantor (as the case may be) would be obligated to pay such Additional Amounts were a payment in respect of the Secured Notes
then due and payable.

Before the Company publishes or mails notice of redemption of the Secured Notes as described above, it will deliver to the
Secured Notes Trustee (i) an Officer’s Certificate to the effect that the Company or any Secured Note Guarantor (as the case may be)
cannot avoid its obligation to pay Additional Amounts by taking reasonable measures available to it and (ii) an opinion in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to the Secured Notes Trustee of independent legal counsel of recognized standing stating that the
Company or Secured Note Guarantor (as the case may be) is or would be obligated to pay Additional Amounts as a result of a Change
in Tax Laws. The Secured Notes Trustee shall be entitled to accept such Officer’s Certificate and opinion as sufficient existence of the
satisfaction of the conditions precedent described above, in which event it will be conclusive and binding on the Holders.

105


-----

The foregoing provisions will apply mutatis mutandis to any successor person to the Company or Secured Note Guarantor after
such successor person becomes a party to the Secured Indenture.

For so long as the Secured Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted for trading on the
Euro MTF Market of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, and to the extent the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, the
Company will provide a copy of any such notice to the Luxembourg Stock Exchange. Notices of redemption will be given in
accordance with the provisions set forth under “—Selection and notice of redemption.”

**Credit enhancement**

**_Overview_**

Credit enhancement for the Secured Notes will include:

   - the Secured Note Guarantees by certain Subsidiaries of the Company (the “Secured Note Guarantees”);

   - the pledge or assignment of the Intercompany Loans held by the Company and Sub Lecta 1 S.A. to the Security Trustee; and

   - the pledge of rights and related security under the Secured Notes Proceeds Loan from Condat Holding S.A. to Condat S.A.S.

Each Secured Note Guarantee will be secured by certain of the assets of the Subsidiary issuing that Secured Note Guarantee. Not
all of the Subsidiaries of the Company will guarantee the Secured Notes, and most of the Secured Note Guarantees will be subject to
significant limitations. The aggregate unconsolidated EBITDA for the twelve months ended September 30, 2006, as reported in the
respective stand-alone financial statements (the calculation of which differs from the calculation of EBITDA as provided for in the
Indentures relating to the Notes) of Subsidiaries issuing Secured Note Guarantees (after intercompany eliminations) was €114.8
million.

Through a series of intercompany loans (the “Secured Notes Proceeds Loans”), (i) the Company will loan a portion of the net
proceeds of the Secured Notes to each of Sub Lecta 1 S.A. (a Luxembourg société anonyme), Condat Holding S.A. (a French société
anonyme), Torraspapel Holding S.A., Torraspapel S.A. and Sarriopapel y Celulosa S.A. (each, a Spanish sociedad anónima) and, (ii)
in turn, Sub Lecta 1 S.A. will on-loan a portion of the proceeds to Cartiere del Garda S.p.A., an Italian corporation, and Condat
Holding will on lend a portion of the proceeds and make a capital contribution with a portion of the proceeds to Condat S.A.S., a
French société par actions simplifiée. Through a parallel series of intercompany loans (the “Unsecured Notes Proceeds Loans”), the
Company, Sub Lecta 1 S.A. and Condat Holding S.A. will loan a portion of the proceeds of the Unsecured Notes to the same group of
borrowers. The Company’s rights under the intercompany loans comprising the Secured Notes Proceeds Loans, together with the
Company’s rights under the intercompany loans comprising the Unsecured Notes Proceeds Loans (together, the “Intercompany
Loans”) will be pledged by the Company as security to the Security Trustee. In the event of a default in payment on the Secured
Notes, the Intercompany Loans assigned by the Company and Sub Lecta 1 S.A. would provide the Secured Notes Trustee with senior
claims on behalf of the Secured Note Holders for payment directly against those Subsidiaries who received such loans and the indirect
loan from Condat Holding S.A. to Condat S.A.S. would provide indirect claims. Moreover, the French Secured Notes Proceeds Loans
will be secured by certain of the assets of Condat Holding S.A. and Condat S.A.S., as the case may be.

As a result of the credit enhancement arrangements noted above, the Secured Notes Trustee would have direct or indirect senior
secured claims on behalf of the Secured Note Holders against Subsidiaries of the Company having an aggregate (after intercompany
eliminations) of €135.3 million in unconsolidated EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2005 as reported in the respective standalone financial statements of such Subsidiaries.

The credit enhancement arrangements for the Secured Notes vary from Subsidiary to Subsidiary depending on applicable legal
restrictions and other factors. Moreover, these arrangements may be limited in amount and scope, and those limitations are significant.
A summary of the credit enhancement arrangements by Subsidiary is attached to this listing memorandum as Annex A, and you are
urged to review that appendix in connection with making your investment decision.

**_Secured Note Guarantees_**

Each Secured Note Guarantor will jointly and severally guarantee, subject to limitations described in Annex A hereto, as a general
unsubordinated obligation, and as a primary obligor and not merely as a surety, the Company’s obligations under the Secured Notes
and the Secured Indenture. In addition, each Secured Note Guarantor will agree to pay any and all costs and expenses (including
counsel fees and expenses) incurred by the Secured Notes Trustee or the Holders in enforcing any rights under the Secured Note
Guarantees.

The Secured Note Guarantee of the Secured Notes by each Secured Note Guarantor will be a general unsubordinated obligation of
such Secured Note Guarantor and:

   - will rank pari passu in right of payment with all its existing and future Debt that is not subordinated to such guarantee;

   - will rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future subordinated obligations of such Secured Note Guarantor;

   - will be secured by a security interest in favor of the Security Trustee in certain of its assets, including shares in certain
Subsidiaries, but not all assets and no real property; and

   - will be effectively subordinated to any existing and future Debt of such Subsidiary that is secured with assets that do not
secure such guarantee, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such Debt, including certain receivables of Condat
S.A.S. pledged only to secure obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility.

The obligations of each Secured Note Guarantor under its Secured Note Guarantee will be limited to an amount that can be
guaranteed under applicable laws, including corporate benefit laws and financial assistance, fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent
transfer restrictions under applicable insolvency laws, and will not apply to the extent a guarantee would be illegal or unenforceable
under applicable local laws. See Annex A hereto and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes” elsewhere in this listing
memorandum. The Secured Note Guarantees will provide that, in the event of default in the payment of principal of or premium, if
any, interest, Additional Amounts, if any, and any other payment obligations in respect of the Secured Notes (including any obligation
to repurchase the Secured Notes), the Secured Notes Trustee may institute legal proceedings directly against the relevant Secured Note
Guarantor without first proceeding against the Company. The Secured Notes Trustee (acting of its own volition or on the direction of
the Holders of 51% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Secured Notes), and not the Holders of the Secured Notes
individually, may enforce the Secured Note Guarantees and provide directions to the Security Trustee pursuant to the Intercreditor
Agreement to enforce the security for the Secured Note Guarantees.

**_Intercompany Loans_**

Through the Secured Notes Proceeds Loans, (i) the Company intends to loan a portion of the net proceeds of the offering of the
Secured Notes to Sub Lecta 1 S.A., Condat Holding S.A., Torraspapel Holding S.A., Torraspapel S.A. and Sarriopapel y Celulosa
S.A. and, (ii) in turn, Sub Lecta 1 S.A. will on- loan a portion of the proceeds to Cartiere del Garda S.p.A., and Condat Holding S.A.
will on lend a portion of the proceeds to Condat S.A.S. Through the Unsecured Notes Proceeds Loans, the same lenders intend to loan
a portion of the net proceeds of the offering of the Unsecured Notes to the same borrowers. The proceeds of all such intercompany
lending will be used to repay existing indebtedness of certain of the Company’s Subsidiaries and to pay fees and expenses as
described under “Use of proceeds.” Interest will accrue on the Secured Notes Proceeds Loans and Unsecured Notes Proceeds Loans at
rates at least equal to the interest rates payable on the Secured Notes and Unsecured Notes, respectively, with such adjustments as may
be necessary to match any Additional Amounts, premium or default interest due with respect to the Secured Notes or Unsecured
Notes, as the case may be. The Intercompany Loans provide for repayments of principal in amounts and at times sufficient to enable
repayments in full or in part of principal under the Secured Notes or Unsecured Notes, as the case may be, whether at maturity, on
early redemption or upon acceleration. Several of the entities issuing Intercompany Loans are holding companies that have no
operations and generate no revenues of their own and have no independent assets other than their investments in their respective
Subsidiaries. To the extent such entities must make payments on the Intercompany Loans, they will be dependent on dividends
received from their subsidiaries, payments on intercompany loans or other distributions.

Each Intercompany Loan will be a general unsubordinated obligation of the Subsidiary borrowing such loan and:

107


-----

   - will rank pari passu in right of payment with all its existing and future Debt that is not subordinated to such Intercompany
Loan;

   - will rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future subordinated obligations of such Subsidiary; and

   - will be effectively subordinated to any existing and future Debt of such Subsidiary that is secured with property and assets
that do not secure such Intercompany Loan, to the extent of the value of such assets, including certain receivables of Condat
S.A.S. assigned only to secure obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility.

The French Secured Notes Proceeds Loan from Condat Holding S.A. to Condat S.A.S. will also benefit from the pledge of certain
bank accounts if and to the extent such bank accounts are pledged in favor of the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility.

**_Security_**

As noted above, the Secured Note Guarantees will benefit from security directly in favor of the Security Trustee, and the French
Secured Notes Proceeds Loans will benefit from security in favor of Condat Holding S.A. and Condat S.A.S. over certain of the assets
of the entity issuing such guarantee or borrowing under such Intercompany Loan, as the case may be (collectively, the “Collateral”),
as set forth in further detail in Annex A. As a result, the Secured Notes Trustee on behalf of the Holders will be the beneficiary of
security over shares of companies (after intercompany eliminations) with an aggregate of over €135 million of unconsolidated
EBITDA for the twelve months ended September 30, 2006 as reported in the respective stand-alone financial statements of such
companies. For more information, see Annex A to this listing memorandum.

No appraisals of the Collateral have been prepared by or on behalf of the Company in connection with the issuance of the Secured
Notes. There can be no assurance that the proceeds from the sale of the Collateral would be sufficient to satisfy the obligations owed
to the Holders of the Secured Notes. By its nature, some or all of the Collateral will be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable
market value. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the Collateral would be able to be sold in a short period of time, if at all.

The Secured Notes Trustee and the creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility have, and by accepting a Secured Note, each
Holder will be deemed to have, irrevocably appointed Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch as security trustee to act as its security
trustee under the Intercreditor Agreement, the Secured Notes, the Secured Notes Indenture (including the Secured Note Guarantee)
and the Security Documents (together, the “Finance Documents”). The Secured Notes Trustee and the creditors under the Revolving
Credit Facility have, and by accepting a Secured Note, each Holder will be deemed to have, irrevocably authorized the Security
Trustee to (i) perform the duties and exercise the rights, powers and discretions that are specifically given to it under the Intercreditor
Agreement or other Finance Documents, together with any other incidental rights, power and discretions, and (ii) execute each
Finance Document expressed to be executed by the Security Trustee on its behalf.

**_Release of Secured Note Guarantees_**

Pursuant to the Secured Indenture, the Capital Stock of a Secured Note Guarantor may be sold, leased, transferred or otherwise
disposed of to another Person under the covenant described under “— Certain covenants—Limitation on sales of assets and Restricted
Subsidiary stock.”

Upon any sale or disposition (including, without limitation, by way of merger, consolidation or otherwise) of (i) Capital Stock of a
Secured Note Guarantor following which such Secured Note Guarantor is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary, (ii) all or substantially all
of the properties and assets of such Secured Note Guarantor to a Person that is not (either before or after giving effect to such
transaction) the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company or (iii) all or substantially all of the properties and assets of such
Secured Note Guarantor to another Secured Note Guarantor in connection with a liquidation or dissolution of such Secured Note
Guarantor provided that such other Secured Note Guarantor expressly assumes in writing in form satisfactory to the Secured Notes
Trustee in its sole discretion all the obligations of such Secured Note Guarantor under the Secured Indenture, as long as the sale or
disposition complies with the covenant described in “—Certain covenants—Limitation on sales of assets and Restricted Subsidiary
stock,” the Secured Note Guarantee of any such Restricted Subsidiary will be released; _provided, however, that such release is in_
accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement. See “Description of other indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement.”

The Secured Note Guarantee provided by a Secured Note Guarantor also will be released:

108


-----

(i) upon the valid designation of such Secured Note Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary;

(ii) if the Company exercises its legal defeasance option or covenant defeasance option as described under “—Defeasance” or if
its obligations under the Secured Indenture are discharged in accordance with the terms of the Secured Indenture, in each case
in accordance with the terms and conditions in the Secured Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement;

(iii) upon repayment in full of the Secured Notes;

(iv) upon a sale of all the Capital Stock of the applicable Secured Note Guarantor (or any parent of such Secured Note Guarantor)
pursuant to an Enforcement Action pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement; and

(v) in the event that the continued obligations of such Secured Note Guarantor or the continued existence of such Secured Note
Guarantor could reasonably be expected to give rise to or result in (now or in the future): (a) any violation of applicable law or
(b) any personal liability for the officers, directors or indirect shareholders of such Secured Note Guarantor; which in each case
of (a) and (b) cannot be avoided or otherwise prevented through measures reasonably available to the Company and the
Secured Note Guarantor.

Upon request and at the cost of the Company, or, as the case may be, the relevant Secured Note Guarantor and upon delivery by
the Company to the Secured Notes Trustee of an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel to the foregoing effect, the Secured
Notes Trustee will execute any documents reasonably requested by the Company or the relevant Secured Note Guarantor, as the case
may be, in writing in order to evidence the release, discharge and termination in respect of any Secured Note Guarantee to be released
as described above.

The release of guarantees under the Unsecured Indenture is governed by the provisions of such indenture. See “Description of the
Unsecured Notes.”

**_Release of Collateral_**

The Collateral created by the Security Documents shall be released and the Security Trustee shall disclaim and give up any and all
rights it has in or to the Collateral, and any rights it has under the Security Documents:

(i) if the Collateral is an asset of a Secured Note Guarantor (or any of its Subsidiaries), upon designation of the Secured Note
Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary;

(ii) if the Company exercises its legal defeasance option or covenant defeasance option as described under “—Defeasance” or if
its obligations under the Secured Indenture are discharged in accordance with the terms of the Secured Indenture, in each case
in accordance with the terms and conditions in the Secured Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement;

(iii) upon repayment in full of the Secured Notes;

(iv) upon the surrender of all outstanding Secured Notes issued under the Secured Indenture to the Secured Notes Trustee for
cancellation;

(v) upon foreclosure on Collateral pursuant to an Enforcement Action pursuant to any Security Document or the Intercreditor
Agreement;

(vi) upon the release of the Collateral in accordance with the paragraph below;

(vii) in the event that the continued obligations under the Liens on the Collateral could reasonably be expected to give rise to or
result in (now or in the future): (a) any violation of applicable law or (b) any personal liability for the officers, directors or
indirect shareholders of the pledgor of the Collateral; which in each case of (a) and (b) cannot be avoided or otherwise
prevented through measures reasonably available to the Company and the pledgor; or

109


-----

(viii) upon any other valid release of the Collateral as security for obligations of the Company or a Secured Note Guarantor under
the Secured Indenture;

provided such release is in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement.

Upon request of the Company or any Secured Note Guarantor, in connection with any sale, lease, sale and leaseback, assignment,
conveyance, transfer or other disposition of assets or property permitted by the Secured Indenture (including, without limitation, the
covenants described in “—Certain covenants—Limitation on sales of assets and Restricted Subsidiary stock” and “—Certain
covenants—Consolidation, merger and sale of assets”), the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents, the Security Trustee
shall (without notice to, or vote or consent of, any Holder) take such actions as shall be required to release its security interest in any
Collateral being disposed in such disposition, to the extent necessary to permit consummation of such disposition in accordance with
the Secured Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents, and the Security Trustee shall receive full payment
therefor from the Company for any costs incurred thereby. In all cases of a disposition involving a release of Collateral, the Company
shall deliver to the Security Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel certifying compliance with the requirements of
release under the Secured Indenture. At the request of the Company, the Security Trustee shall execute and deliver an appropriate
instrument evidencing such release (in the form provided by the Company and agreed by the Security Trustee).

Any release of Collateral made in compliance with the provisions set forth in “—Release of Collateral” shall not be deemed to
impair the Lien under the Security Documents or the Collateral thereunder in contravention of the Covenant described in “—Certain
covenants—Limitation on Liens.”

**Change of Control**

If a Change of Control occurs, the Company will, within 30 days after the occurrence of such Change of Control, notify each
Holder of the Secured Notes in accordance with the provisions set forth under “—Notices,” with a copy of such notice to the Secured
Notes Trustee in writing, of the occurrence of the Change of Control and will make an offer to purchase (the “Change of Control
Offer”) the Secured Notes, in whole or in part, in principal amounts of €50,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 above €50,000 at a
purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the Change of Control
Purchase Date (such price, together with such interest, the “Change of Control Purchase Price”), on or before the date specified in
such notice, which date (the “Change of Control Purchase Date”) shall be no earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days from the date
such notice is mailed, or such later date as may be required by law or any applicable requirements of any securities exchange on which
such Secured Notes are listed. The Change of Control Offer is required to remain open for at least 20 Business Days and until the
close of business on the Change of Control Purchase Date. The Company will purchase all Secured Notes properly tendered in the
Change of Control Offer and not withdrawn in accordance with the procedures set forth in such notice. The Change of Control Offer
will state, among other things, the procedures that Holders of the Secured Notes must follow to accept the Change of Control Offer.

The Unsecured Notes Indenture and the Revolving Credit Facility will have similar provisions requiring the Company and/or
borrowers under such instruments to offer to repay such instruments. No assurance can be given that the Company will have sufficient
liquidity to comply with such provisions and to make the Change of Control Offers required by the Secured Notes Indenture and the
Unsecured Notes Indenture.

The Company will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control if a third party makes the
Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Secured
Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Company and purchases all Secured Notes validly tendered and not
withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer.

The occurrence of certain of the events which would constitute a Change of Control would require mandatory prepayment of Debt
outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility and might constitute a default under, or require prepayment of, future Debt of the
Company or its Subsidiaries. The occurrence of a Change of Control would also trigger an obligation of the Company to repurchase
the Unsecured Notes, which may in turn lead to a default under the Unsecured Notes if the Company cannot finance such a
repurchase. In addition, the exercise by the Holders of the Secured Notes of their right to require the Company to repurchase the
Secured Notes could cause a default under the Debt of the Company or its Subsidiaries, even if the Change of Control itself does not,
due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Company. Finally, if a Change of Control Offer is made, there can be no
assurance that the Company will have sufficient funds or other resources to pay the Change of Control Purchase Price for all the

110


-----

Secured Notes that might be delivered by Holders thereof seeking to accept the Change of Control Offer. See “Risk Factors—Risks
Related to the Notes—We may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance a change of control offer if required by the
terms and conditions of the Notes” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes—Our significant leverage may make it difficult for
us to service our debt, including the Notes, and to operate our business.”

The Change of Control provisions described above may deter certain mergers, tender offers and other takeover attempts involving
the Company and, thus, the removal of incumbent management. One of the events that constitutes a Change of Control under the
Secured Indenture is a sale, conveyance, transfer or lease of all or substantially all the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole. The phrase “all or substantially all” is subject to judicial interpretation depending on the facts and circumstances of
the subject transaction. The Secured Indenture will be governed by New York law, and there is no established quantitative definition
under New York law of “substantially all” the assets of a corporation. Accordingly, in certain circumstances it may be unclear whether
a Change of Control has occurred and whether the Company may therefore be required to make a Change of Control Offer.

If at the time of such Change of Control, the Secured Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and
admitted for trading on the Euro MTF Market of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, to the extent required by the rules of the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange, the Company will notify the Luxembourg Stock Exchange that a Change of Control has occurred and
any relevant details relating to such Change of Control.

The Company will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended (the “U.S. Exchange Act”), and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of
Secured Notes pursuant to any Change of Control Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict
with provisions relating to the Change of Control Offer, the Company will comply with applicable securities laws and regulations and
will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control covenant by virtue thereof.

**Certain covenants**

The Secured Indenture contains, among others, the following covenants:

**_Limitation on Debt_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, Incur any Debt (including Acquired
Debt) other than Permitted Debt; provided however, that the Company may, and may permit any Secured Note Guarantor to, Incur
Debt if (i) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of such Incurrence or would occur as a
consequence of such Incurrence and (ii) after giving Pro forma effect to such Incurrence, the Consolidated Coverage Ratio as of the
date of the Incurrence of such Debt would exceed 2.50 to 1.00.

Permitted Debt is defined as follows:

(i) Debt (a) of the Issuer evidenced by the Secured Notes issued on the Issue Date (not including Additional Secured Notes), (b) of
the Secured Note Guarantors in respect of the Secured Note Guarantees, including any Additional Secured Note Guarantees, (c)
of the Issuer evidenced by the Unsecured Notes (not including Additional Unsecured Notes), (d) of the Unsecured Note
Guarantors in respect of the Unsecured Note Guarantees, including any Additional Unsecured Note Guarantees (but only to the
extent such Additional Unsecured Note Guarantees are given by a Subsidiary that also provides an Additional Secured Note
Guarantee), and (e) any “parallel debt” obligations created under the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Documents or the
Secured Indenture in respect of clauses (a) and (b);

(ii) Debt of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary (x) Incurred under the Revolving Credit Facility (including, without double
counting, any Debt to the extent backed by letters of credit, guarantees or bonds issued under the Revolving Credit Facility),
and (y) any Refinancing Debt and any “parallel debt” obligations created under the Intercreditor Agreement or the Security
Documents Incurred in respect of Debt under (x), _provided, that the aggregate principal amount of all such Debt under the_
Revolving Credit Facility and Refinancing Debt in respect thereof under this clause (ii) at any one time outstanding does not
exceed €75 million, which amount shall be permanently reduced by any payments made by the Company under the Revolving
Credit Facility with the Net Available Cash from any Asset Disposition (which are accompanied by a corresponding

111


-----

permanent commitment reduction) pursuant to clause (iii) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation
on sales of assets and Restricted Subsidiary stock.”

(iii) (intentionally omitted);

(iv) Debt Incurred by the Subsidiary which owns and operates (or will operate) the Riva del Garda cogeneration facility in an
amount not to exceed €55 million, provided such Debt is used for the purpose of investing in the Riva del Garda cogeneration
facility and provided, further, (A) that such Debt is not secured by assets of the Company or any other Restricted Subsidiary
(other than shares of the Subsidiary which owns and operates (or will operate) such facility and its assets) and neither the
Company nor any Restricted Subsidiary guarantees such Debt in any way, directly or indirectly, or provides any “keep well”
or guarantees of the net worth of such Subsidiary; and (B) such Subsidiary does not own any Capital Stock, Redeemable
Stock or Debt of, or own or hold any Lien on any property or assets of, the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(v) Debt of the Company owing to and held by any Restricted Subsidiary and Debt of any Restricted Subsidiary owing to and held
by the Company or any wholly-owned Restricted Subsidiary; provided, however, that if such debt is owed by the Company or
a Secured Note Guarantor (other than an Intercompany Loan), then it shall be expressly subordinated to the prior payment in
full in cash of all obligations with respect to the Secured Notes; and provided, further, that any subsequent transfer of any such
Debt (except to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary), shall be deemed, in each case, to constitute the Incurrence of such
Debt by the issuer thereof;

(vi) Debt (other than Debt permitted by the immediately preceding paragraph or elsewhere in this paragraph) in an aggregate
principal amount outstanding at any time not to exceed €50 million;

(vii) the incurrence by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of Debt represented by Capitalized Lease Obligations,
mortgage financings or purchase money obligations, in each case, incurred for the purpose of financing or refinancing all or
any part of the purchase price or cost of construction or improvement of property, plant or equipment used in the business of
the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, or in respect of a sale and leaseback transaction, in an aggregate principal
amount, not to exceed €5 million at any time outstanding;

(viii) Debt Incurred pursuant to any Qualified Receivables Financing that is not recourse to the Company or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries except for such recourse as arises through Standard Securitization Undertakings;

(ix) Debt under Hedging Obligations that are incurred in the ordinary course of business, not for speculative purposes and (1) for
the purpose of fixing or hedging interest rate risk with respect to any Debt Incurred without violation of the Secured
Indenture; (2) for the purpose of fixing or hedging currency exchange rate risk with respect to any currency; or (3) for the
purpose of fixing or hedging commodity price risk with respect to any commodities;

(x) Debt in connection with one or more standby letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or performance, bid, surety, judgment,
appeal or similar bonds or completion guarantees provided by the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary and issued in the
ordinary course of business or pursuant to self-insurance obligations and not in connection with the borrowing of money or the
obtaining of advances of credit;

(xi) Debt arising from the honoring by a bank or other financial institution of a check, draft or similar instrument drawn against
insufficient funds, overdrafts or cash pooling arrangements in the ordinary course of business; provided, however, that any
such Debt that arises is extinguished within six Business Days of Incurrence;

(xii) Debt of the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries represented by letters of credit for the account of the Company or
such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, in order to provide security for workers’ compensation claims, payment
obligations in connection with self-insurance or similar requirements in the ordinary course of business;

(xiii) Debt arising from agreements of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary providing for indemnification, adjustment of
purchase price, earn out or similar obligations, in each case, Incurred in connection with the disposition of any business,
assets or Subsidiary, other than guarantees of Debt Incurred by any Person acquiring all or any portion of such business,
assets or Subsidiary for the purpose of financing such acquisition; provided that the maximum aggregate liability in respect

112


-----

of all such Debt shall at no time exceed the gross proceeds actually received by the Company and the Restricted Subsidiary
in connection with such disposition;

(xiv) guarantees by the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary of Debt Incurred by the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary so long
as the Incurrence of such Debt by the Company or any such Restricted Subsidiary is otherwise permitted by the terms of the
Secured Indenture;

(xv) guarantees by the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary of Debt Incurred by Joint Ventures that does not exceed €5 million in
the aggregate at any one time outstanding;

(xvi) Debt of a Person existing at the time that Person becomes a Restricted Subsidiary or assumed in connection with an Asset
Acquisition by the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary and not Incurred in connection with or in anticipation of, such Person
becoming a Restricted Subsidiary; _provided that the holders of any such Debt do not, at any time, have direct or indirect_
recourse to any property or assets of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary other than the property or assets of such
acquired Person; provided, further, that on the date of such acquisition and after giving Pro forma effect thereto, either (1)
the Company would have been able to Incur at least €1.00 of additional Debt pursuant to the immediately preceding
paragraph or (2) the Consolidated Coverage Ratio would be greater than or equal to the Consolidated Coverage Ratio
immediately prior to giving Pro forma effect to such acquisition;

(xvii) Debt of the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries Incurred pursuant to an obligation imposed by law to transfer
employee benefit obligation to a third party;

(xviii) Debt pursuant to the reclassification of any provision reflecting obligations under the put-call arrangement with Grupo
Torras in relation to shares in Torraspapel S.A. that arise as a result of a change to IFRS or as a result of the exercise of any
put or call pursuant to such put-call arrangement;

(xix) Debt of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary not otherwise described in clauses (i) through (xviii) above (1)
outstanding on the Issue Date and disclosed in the Offering Memorandum and (2) any Refinancing Debt Incurred in respect
thereof; and

(xx) Refinancing Debt Incurred in respect of Debt Incurred under the first paragraph of this covenant or under clause (i) or (xvi)
hereof;

_provided, however, that, for purposes of determining the compliance of any non-euro-denominated Debt Incurred under clauses (ii),_
(iv), (vi), (vii), (xv) or (xvi) above with the euro-denominated restriction contained therein, the euro-equivalent principal amount of
such Debt Incurred pursuant thereto will be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Debt
was Incurred, in the case of term Debt, or first committed, in the case of revolving credit Debt; provided, that (i) the euro-equivalent
principal amount of any such Debt outstanding on the Issue Date under clause (ii) above (other than term Debt) will be calculated
based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date thereof and (ii) (A) any Refinancing Debt Incurred to refinance noneuro-denominated Debt previously Incurred which would cause the euro-denominated restriction under such clause to be exceeded if
calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing (the “Initial Refinancing Rate”) will be
deemed not to exceed such euro-denominated restriction under such clause so long as the principal amount of such Refinancing Debt
does not exceed the principal amount of the Debt being refinanced, and (B) all subsequent Incurrences of Refinancing Debt subject to
the euro-denominated restriction under such clause will be determined as if the relevant currency exchange rate applied to any
subsequent Refinancing Debt was the Initial Refinancing Rate; provided, however, that the principal amount of any such subsequent
Refinancing Debt, if Incurred in a currency other than the currency of the Debt being refinanced, will be calculated based on the
currency exchange rate applicable to the currency or currencies in which such proposed Refinancing Debt is denominated on the date
of such refinancing.

For purposes of determining any particular amount of Debt under this “—Limitation on Debt” covenant, accrual of interest,
accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the obligation to pay commitment fees and the payment of interest in the form of
additional Debt shall not be treated as Debt. In addition, for purposes of determining compliance with this “—Limitation on Debt”
covenant, in the event that an item of proposed Debt meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of Permitted Debt described
in clauses (i) through (xviii) above, or is entitled to be Incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant, the Company shall be

113


-----

permitted to classify such item of Debt on the date of its Incurrence and, except with respect to Debt Incurred under clause (ii) above,
reclassify such item of Debt, in each case in any manner that complies with this covenant.

**_Limitation on Restricted Payments_**

The Company will not make, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to make, directly or indirectly, any Restricted Payment
if at the time of, and after giving effect to, such proposed Restricted Payment,

(a)  a Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing,

(b) the Company could not Incur at least €1.00 of additional Debt pursuant to the first paragraph of the covenant described under
“—Limitation on Debt,” or

(c) the aggregate amount of such Restricted Payment and all other Restricted Payments declared or made since the Issue Date (the
amount of any Restricted Payment, if made other than in cash, to be based upon Fair Market Value) would exceed an amount
equal to the sum of:

(i) 50% of the aggregate Consolidated Net Income accrued during the period (treated as one accounting period) from the Issue
Date, to the end of the Company’s most recent fiscal quarter ending prior to the date of such proposed Restricted Payment (or if
Consolidated Net Income shall be a deficit, minus 100% of such deficit),

(ii) Capital Stock Sale Proceeds and (without duplication of any amounts included in Capital Stock Sale Proceeds) Capital Stock
Contributions, and

(iii) the amount by which Debt of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary is reduced on the Company’s balance sheet upon the
conversion or exchange (other than by a Subsidiary) subsequent to the Issue Date of any Debt of the Company or any
Restricted Subsidiary convertible or exchangeable for Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock) of the Company (less the
amount of any cash or other property distributed by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary upon such conversion or
exchange).

Notwithstanding the foregoing limitation, the Company and any Restricted Subsidiary may:

(a) pay dividends on its Capital Stock within 60 days of the declaration thereof if, on said declaration date, such dividends could
have been paid in compliance with the Secured Indenture; _provided, however, that such dividend shall be included in the_
calculation of the amount of Restricted Payments;

(b) redeem, repurchase, defease, acquire or retire for value, any Subordinated Obligation with the proceeds of any Refinancing
Debt in respect of such Subordinated Obligation; _provided, however_ that such redemption, repurchase, defeasance or other

(c) make any Restricted Payment by exchange for, or out of the proceeds of the substantially concurrent sale of, Capital Stock of
the Company (other than Disqualified Stock and other than Capital Stock issued or sold to a Subsidiary of the Company or an
employee stock ownership plan or to a trust established by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for the benefit of their
employees) or Capital Stock Contributions; _provided, however, that (i) such Restricted Payment shall be excluded in the_
calculation of the amount of Restricted Payments and (ii) the Net Cash Proceeds from such sale or contribution shall, to the
extent so used to acquire, redeem or retire Capital Stock of the Company or Subordinated Obligations of the Company, be
excluded from the calculation of the amount of Capital Stock Sale Proceeds and Capital Stock Contributions;

(d) make cash payments in lieu of issuing fractional shares pursuant to the exercise or conversion of any exercisable or convertible

**_Transactions with Affiliates_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, enter into any transaction or series
of related transactions (including the purchase, sale, transfer, assignment, lease, conveyance or exchange of any property or the
rendering of any service) with, or for the benefit of, any Affiliate of the Company (an “Affiliate Transaction”) unless (a) the terms of
such Affiliate Transaction are no less favorable to the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that
could be obtained in a comparable arm’s length transaction with a Person that is not an Affiliate of the Company or such Restricted
Subsidiary, (b) with respect to an Affiliate Transaction involving aggregate payments or value in excess of €5 million, the terms of
such Affiliate Transaction are set forth in writing and the Board of Directors (including a majority of the disinterested members of the
Board of Directors) approves such Affiliate Transaction and, in its good faith judgment, believes that such Affiliate Transaction
complies with clause (a) of this paragraph and (c) with respect to an Affiliate Transaction involving aggregate payments or value in
excess of €20 million, the terms of such Affiliate Transaction are set forth in writing and the Company obtains a written opinion from
an Independent Appraiser to the effect that such Affiliate Transaction is fair, from a financial point of view, to the Company or is not
less favorable to the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary than could have been obtained in a comparable arms’ length transaction
with a Person that is not an Affiliate of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary.

The foregoing covenant will not prohibit: (A) Permitted Investments and any Restricted Payment permitted to be paid as described
above under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments,” (B) any issuance of securities, or other payments, awards or grants in cash,
securities or otherwise pursuant to, or the funding of or other transactions pursuant to, employment arrangements, stock options and
stock ownership plans approved by the Board of Directors of the Company, (C) loans or advances to employees of the Company in the
ordinary course of business, (D) the payment of reasonable fees, compensation and employee benefit arrangements, customary
insurance and indemnities to directors, officers, managers, employees or consultants of the Company and of Restricted Subsidiaries,
(E) any transaction between the Company and a Restricted Subsidiary or between Restricted Subsidiaries, (F) the performance of any
agreement as in effect on the Issue Date which is disclosed to Holders of the Secured Notes in the Offering Memorandum under the
heading “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions” or any amendment or renewal thereto or any transaction contemplated
thereby or in any replacement agreement thereto so long as any such amendment or renewal or replacement agreement is not more
disadvantageous to the Holders of Secured Notes (as determined by the Board of Directors of the Company in their reasonable and
good faith judgment) in any material respect than the original agreement, (G) transactions between or among any of the Company, any
of its Subsidiaries and any Person in connection with a Qualified Receivables Financing, in each case provided that such transactions
are not otherwise prohibited by the Secured Indenture, (H) transactions between the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries and
any Person that is an Affiliate solely as a result of the ownership by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of Capital Stock
of such Person, (I) transactions with customers, clients, suppliers or purchasers or sellers of goods or services, in each case in the
ordinary course of business and otherwise in compliance with the terms of the Secured Indenture which are fair to the Company or its
Restricted Subsidiaries, or are on terms at least as favorable as might reasonably have been obtained at such time from an unaffiliated
party, in each case in the reasonable determination of the Board of Directors of the Company or the senior management thereof or (J)
payments by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, directly or indirectly, to CVC Capital Partners Limited and its
Affiliates made for any financial advisory, financing, underwriting, management or placement services or in respect of other
investment banking activities, including in connection with acquisitions or divestitures, which payments are reasonably related to the
services performed and customary for the nature of the services performed and approved by the Board of Directors of the Company in
good faith.

**_Limitation on Liens_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, Incur Secured Debt of any kind (other than Secured Debt
secured by a Permitted Lien) unless contemporaneously therewith, effective provision is also made that:

115


-----

(1) in the case of Secured Debt that is expressly subordinate or junior in right of payment to the Secured Notes or a Secured Note
Guarantee, the Secured Notes or such Secured Note Guarantee, as the case may be, are secured prior to such Secured Debt for
so long as such Secured Debt is secured by a Lien; and

(2) in all other cases, the Secured Notes or the Secured Note Guarantee of such Secured Note Guarantor, as the case may be, is
secured equally and ratably to such Secured Debt for so long as such Secured Debt is secured by a Lien.

**_Limitation on guarantees of Debt by Restricted Subsidiaries_**

The Company will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Secured Note Guarantor, directly or indirectly, to guarantee,
assume or in any other manner become liable for the payment of any Debt of the Company or a Secured Note Guarantor under any
Debt unless:

(1) (A)  such Restricted Subsidiary simultaneously executes and delivers a supplemental indenture providing for a Secured Note
Guarantee of payment of the Secured Notes by such Restricted Subsidiary on the same terms as the guarantee of such Debt;
and

(B) with respect to any guarantee of Subordinated Obligations by such Restricted Subsidiary, any such guarantee will be
subordinated to such Restricted Subsidiary’s Secured Note Guarantee at least to the same extent as such Subordinated
Obligations are subordinated to the Secured Notes; and

(2) such Restricted Subsidiary waives and will not in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any rights
of reimbursement, indemnity or subrogation or any other rights against the Company or any other Restricted Subsidiary as a
result of any payment by such Restricted Subsidiary under its Secured Note Guarantee.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be obligated to cause any such Restricted Subsidiary to guarantee the
Secured Notes to the extent that such Secured Note Guarantee would reasonably be expected to give rise to or result in (i) any
violation of applicable law, rule, regulation or order that cannot be avoided or otherwise prevented through measures reasonably
available to the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary or (ii) any liability for the officers, directors or shareholders of such Restricted
Subsidiary.

In addition, notwithstanding the foregoing and the other provisions of the Secured Indenture, any Secured Note Guarantee issued
pursuant to this covenant by a Restricted Subsidiary shall provide by its terms that it shall be automatically and unconditionally
released and discharged in the circumstances described under “—Credit enhancement—Release of Secured Note Guarantees.”

**_Limitation on restrictions on distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, create or otherwise cause or permit
to exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to (a) pay dividends
or make any other distributions on its Capital Stock, (b) make any loans or advances to the Company or any other Restricted
Subsidiary or (c) transfer any of its property or assets to the Company or any other Restricted Subsidiary, except:

(i) any encumbrance or restriction which is in effect at or entered into on the Issue Date, including pursuant to the Revolving
Credit Facility, and which is (a) disclosed in the Offering Memorandum under the heading “Description of Other Indebtedness”
or “Description of the Unsecured Notes,” or the Unsecured Indenture, or (b) in respect of Debt permitted under clause (iv) of
the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Debt,” provided that the encumbrance or restriction
applies only to the Restricted Subsidiary which owns the Riva del Garda co-generation facility and the conditions of clause (B)
of such clause (iv) are satisfied;

(ii) any encumbrance or restriction with respect to a Restricted Subsidiary or property or assets pursuant to an agreement on or
prior to the date on which such Restricted Subsidiary or property or assets was acquired by the Company or a Restricted
Subsidiary (other than Debt Incurred as consideration in, or to provide all or any portion of the funds or credit support utilized
to consummate, the transaction or series of related transactions pursuant to which such Restricted Subsidiary became a

116


-----

Restricted Subsidiary or was acquired by the Company or Restricted Subsidiary or the property or assets were acquired by the
Company or Restricted Subsidiary) and outstanding on such date;

(iii) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement effecting an amendment, modification, restatement, renewal,
increase, supplement, refund, replacement or refinancing of an agreement referred to in clauses (i) or (ii) of this covenant or
this clause (iii); provided, however, that the encumbrances and restrictions contained in any such agreement or amendment,
taken as a whole, are no less favorable to the Holders of the Secured Notes than encumbrances and restrictions contained in
such predecessor agreements;

(iv) any encumbrance or restriction (A) consisting of customary provisions restricting subletting or assignment of leases and
customary provisions in other agreements that restrict assignment of such agreements or rights thereunder or customary
restrictions contained in asset sale agreements limiting the transfer of such property pending the closing of such sale, (B)
arising by virtue of any transfer of, agreement to transfer, option or right with respect to, or Lien on, any property or assets of
the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary not otherwise prohibited by the terms of the Secured Indenture or (C) arising or
agreed to in the ordinary course of business and that does not, individually or in the aggregate, detract from the value of
property or assets of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in any manner material to the Company
and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole;

(v) in the case of clause (c) above, restrictions contained in Capitalized Lease Obligations, security agreements or mortgages
securing Debt of a Restricted Subsidiary to the extent such restrictions restrict the transfer of the property subject to such
Capitalized Lease Obligations, security agreements or mortgages;

(vi) any restriction with respect to a Restricted Subsidiary imposed pursuant to an agreement entered into for the sale or
disposition of all or substantially all the Capital Stock or assets of such Restricted Subsidiary pending the closing of such sale
or disposition;

(vii) any encumbrance or restriction with respect to a Restricted Subsidiary imposed pursuant to a Permitted Joint Venture
Transaction;

(viii) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement related to Debt in respect of any Qualified Receivables Financing
which is permitted under clause (viii) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Debt;”

(ix) any encumbrance or restriction imposed pursuant to any Interest Rate Protection Agreement, Currency Exchange Protection
Agreement or Commodity Agreement;

(x) any encumbrance or restriction imposed by applicable law, rules, regulations and/or orders;

(xi) any encumbrances or restrictions on cash or other deposits or net worth imposed by customers under contracts entered into in
the ordinary course of business; and

(xii) any encumbrances or restrictions Incurred in accordance with the covenant described under “—Limitation on Liens.”

**_Limitation on sales of assets and Restricted Subsidiary stock_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, make any Asset Disposition unless:

(i) the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, receives consideration at the time of such Asset Disposition at
least equal to the Fair Market Value of the assets subject to such Asset Disposition;

(ii) at least 75% of such consideration consists of cash or Cash Equivalents, and is received at the time of the Asset Disposition
(which shall be deemed to include other consideration converted to cash or Cash Equivalents within 90 days of such Asset
Disposition); and

117


-----

(iii) an amount equal to 100% of the Net Available Cash from such Asset Disposition is applied by the Company or such
Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be:

(A) _first, to the extent the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary elects, to make an investment in, or expenditures for, properties_
and assets (including by means of an investment in Additional Assets by a Restricted Subsidiary with Net Available Cash
received by the Company or another Restricted Subsidiary) within twelve months from the later of such Asset Disposition or
the receipt of such Net Available Cash or pursuant to arrangements in place within the twelve-month period (to the extent
such arrangements are completed within 180 days after execution of such arrangement);

(B) _second, to the extent of the balance of such Net Available Cash after application in accordance with clause (A), to the extent_
the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary elects (or is required by the terms of Debt), to prepay, repay or purchase Senior
Debt of the Company or any Secured Note Guarantor or Debt of a Subsidiary of the Company that is not a Secured Note
Guarantor (in each case other than Debt owed to the Company or an Affiliate of the Company) within twelve-months from the
later of the date of such Asset Disposition or the receipt of such Net Available Cash;

(C) _third, to the extent of the balance of such Net Available Cash after application in accordance with clauses (A) and (B), to the_
extent the Company elects, to purchase Secured Notes;

(D) _fourth, to the extent of the balance of such Net Available Cash after application in accordance with clauses (A), (B) and (C), to_
make a Prepayment Offer (as defined below) to purchase Secured Notes pursuant to and subject to the conditions described
below; and

(E) _fifth, to the extent of the balance of such Net Available Cash after application in accordance with clauses (A), (B), (C), or (D),_
for any purpose permitted by the Secured Indenture;

_provided, however, that, in connection with any prepayment, repayment or purchase of Debt pursuant to clause (B), (C) or (D), the_
Company or such Restricted Subsidiary will retire such Debt and will cause the related loan commitment (if any) to be
permanently reduced in an amount equal to the principal amount so prepaid, repaid or purchased.

Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries will not be required to apply any Net
Available Cash in accordance with such foregoing provisions to the extent that such Net Available Cash does not exceed €10 million
during any fiscal year, except to the extent that the aggregate Net Available Cash from all Asset Dispositions which are not applied in
accordance with the foregoing provisions exceeds €20 million. Pending application of Net Available Cash pursuant to this provision,
such Net Available Cash may be used to temporarily reduce revolving credit borrowings or otherwise invested in any manner that is
not prohibited by the terms of the Secured Indenture.

In the event of any Asset Disposition that requires the purchase of Secured Notes pursuant to clause (D), the Company will be
required to purchase Secured Notes tendered pursuant to any offer by the Company for Secured Notes (the “Prepayment Offer”) at a
purchase price of 100% of their principal amount plus accrued interest (if any) to the Purchase Date (as defined below) in accordance
with the procedures (including prorating the Secured Notes and Unsecured Notes in the event of oversubscription on the basis of the
aggregate amount of each series of Notes tendered) set forth in the Secured Indenture. The Company will not be required to make a
Prepayment Offer for Secured Notes if the Net Available Cash available therefor (after application of the proceeds as provided in
clauses (A), (B) and (C)) is less than €10 million for any particular Asset Disposition (which lesser amounts will be carried forward
for purposes of determining whether a Prepayment Offer is required with respect to the Net Available Cash from any subsequent Asset
Disposition).

Promptly, and in any event within ten days after the Company becomes obligated to make a Prepayment Offer, the Company will
deliver to the Secured Notes Trustee and to each Holder of Secured Notes in accordance with the provisions set forth under “—
Notices” a written notice stating that such Holder may elect to have its Secured Notes purchased by the Company, either in whole or
in part (subject to prorating in the event the Prepayment Offer is oversubscribed) and in principal amounts of €50,000 and integral
multiples of €1,000 above €50,000 at the applicable purchase price. The notice will specify a purchase date not less than 30 days nor
more than 60 days after the date of such notice (the “Purchase Date”) and will contain information concerning the business of the
Company which the Company in good faith believes will enable Holders of Secured Notes to make an informed decision and will
contain all instructions and material necessary to tender Secured Notes pursuant to the Prepayment Offer and the procedures for

118


-----

withdrawing such a tender (such procedures as set forth in the Secured Indenture). After consummation of any Prepayment Offer, Net
Available Cash shall be reset to zero.

The Company will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the U.S. Exchange Act and any
other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Secured Notes as described above. To the extent that the
provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions relating to the Prepayment Offer, the Company will comply
with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations described above by virtue
thereof.

For the purposes of this covenant, the following will be deemed to be cash: (1) the assumption by the transferee of Debt (other than
Subordinated Obligations) of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary and the release of the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary
from all liability on such Debt in connection with such Asset Disposition (in which case the Company shall, without further action, be
deemed to have applied such assumed Debt in accordance with clause (iii) of the first paragraph of this covenant); and (2) (a) Capital
Stock of a Person conducting a Related Business that as a result of such acquisition becomes a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company
and (b) any other property or assets (other than Debt and Capital Stock) that are used or useful in a Related Business.

**_Monitoring by Secured Notes Trustee_**

The Secured Notes Trustee shall have no responsibility for monitoring any of the covenants described in this section “—Certain
covenants” and shall be entitled to assume, unless it receives written notice to the contrary, that the Company and any Restricted
Subsidiaries are all complying with their covenant obligations described herein. The Company shall, pursuant to the Secured
Indenture, provide to the Secured Notes Trustee a certificate of compliance on an annual basis certifying compliance (or not, as
applicable) with such covenants, and the Secured Notes Trustee will be entitled to rely on such certificates absolutely and without
further enquiry.

**_Reports to Holders_**

For so long as any Secured Notes are outstanding, the Company will provide to the Secured Notes Trustee the following reports:

(a) within 120 days after the end of the Company’s fiscal year, annual reports, in a level of detail that is comparable in all material
respects to that included in the Offering Memorandum (with appropriate revisions, as reasonably determined by the Company,
to reflect changes in segment reporting, and except that the Company shall not be required to commission expert reports as part
of any description of the industry), containing, to the extent applicable, the following information: (i) audited consolidated
balance sheets of the Company as of the end of the two most recent fiscal years and audited consolidated income statements
and statements of cash flow of the Company for the three most recent fiscal years, including complete footnotes to such
financial statements and the report of the independent auditors on the financial statements; (ii) Pro forma income statement and
balance sheet information of the Company, which need not comply with Article 11 of Regulation S-X under the U.S. Exchange
Act (“Regulation S-X”), together with explanatory footnotes, for any material acquisitions, dispositions or recapitalizations
that have occurred since the beginning of the most recently completed fiscal year unless _Pro forma information has been_
provided in a previous report pursuant to clause (b)(ii) or (b)(iii) below (and _provided_ that an acquisition, disposition or
recapitalization that has occurred less than 75 calendar days prior to the date such report is to be provided, such acquisition,
disposition or recapitalization shall be included in the report for the next fiscal quarter); (iii) an operating and financial review
of the audited financial statements, including a discussion of the results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity and
capital resources of the Company, and a discussion of material commitments and contingencies and critical accounting
policies; (iv) a description of the business, management and shareholders of the Company, all material affiliate transactions
and a description of all material contractual arrangements, including material debt instruments; (v) a description of material
risk factors and material recent developments; (vi) earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization; (vii) capital
expenditures; (viii) depreciation and amortization; and (ix) operating profit (loss) in IFRS;

(b) within 60 days following the end of the first three fiscal quarters in each fiscal year of the Company, all quarterly financial
statements of the Company containing the following information: (i) an unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet as of
the end of such quarter and unaudited condensed statements of income and cash flow for the most recent quarter and year-todate periods ending on the unaudited condensed balance sheet date, and the comparable prior year period, together with
condensed footnote disclosure; (ii) Pro forma income statement and balance sheet information of the Company (which need

119


-----

not comply with Article 11 of Regulation S-X), together with explanatory footnotes, for any material acquisitions, dispositions
or recapitalizations that have occurred since the beginning of the most recently completed fiscal year unless _Pro forma_
information has been provided in a previous report pursuant to clause (b)(i) or (b)(iii) (and _provided_ that an acquisition,
disposition or recapitalization that has occurred less than 75 calendar days prior to the date such report is to be provided, such
acquisition, disposition or recapitalization shall be included in the report for the next fiscal quarter or the current fiscal year,
whichever occurs first); (iii) an operating and financial review of the unaudited financial statements, including a discussion of
the results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity and capital resources of the Company, and a discussion of material
commitments and contingencies and critical accounting polices; and (iv) material recent developments and any material
changes to the risk factors disclosed in the most recent annual report; and

(c) promptly after the occurrence of any material acquisition, disposition or restructuring of the Company and its Restricted
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or any senior executive officer changes at the Company or change in auditors of the Company
or any other material event that the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries announces publicly, a report containing a
description of such event.

At any time that any of the Company’s Subsidiaries are Unrestricted Subsidiaries, then the quarterly and annual financial
information required by (a) and (b) above will include a reasonably detailed presentation, either on the face of the financial statements
or in the footnotes thereto, of the financial condition and results of operations of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries separate
from the financial condition and results of operations of the Unrestricted Subsidiaries.

All the financial statements and Pro forma financial information shall be prepared in accordance with IFRS on a consistent basis
for the periods presented. Except as provided for above, no report need include separate financial statements or information for the
Company or Subsidiaries of the Company or any disclosure with respect to the results of operations or any other financial or statistical
disclosure not of a type included in the Offering Memorandum.

For purposes of this covenant, an acquisition or disposition shall be deemed “material” if the business acquired or disposed of
would constitute a “significant subsidiary,” as provided in Rule 1-02(w) of Regulation S-X, substituting 20% for 10% in the tests
therein.

Contemporaneously with the furnishing of each such report discussed above, the Company will also post such report on the
Company’s website or otherwise provide substantially comparable public availability of such report. In the event that the Company
becomes subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the U.S. Exchange Act, or elects to comply with such
provisions, the Company will, for so long as it continues to file the reports required by Section 13(a) with the SEC, make available to
the Secured Notes Trustee the annual reports, information, documents and other reports that the Company is required to file with the
SEC pursuant to such Section 13(a) or 15(d). Upon complying with the foregoing requirement, the Company will be deemed to have
complied with the provisions contained in the preceding three paragraphs.

The Secured Indenture also provides that, so long as any of the Secured Notes remain “restricted securities” within the meaning of
Rule 501 under the U.S. Securities Act and during any period during which the Company is not subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the
U.S. Exchange Act nor exempt therefrom pursuant to Rule 12g3-2(b), the Company will make available to any prospective purchaser
of the Secured Notes or beneficial owner of Secured Notes in connection with any sale thereof the information required by Rule
144A(d)(4) under the U.S. Securities Act. The Company will also make any of the foregoing information available during normal
business hours at the offices of the listing agent in Luxembourg if and so long as the Secured Notes are listed on the Official List of
the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the rules of that exchange so require.

**_Limitation on lines of business_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, engage in any business other than a Related
Business or other than in connection with a Permitted Receivables Financing.

**_Consolidation, merger and sale of assets_**

The Company will not merge or consolidate with or into any other entity (other than a merger or consolidation of a Restricted
Subsidiary into the Company, or the Company into a Restricted Subsidiary (except that such merger or consolidation shall comply

120


-----

with clauses (b) and (e) below) or sell, transfer, assign, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its property or
assets in any one transaction or series of transactions unless the following requirements are satisfied:

(a) the Company shall be the surviving Person or the surviving Person (if other than the Company), formed by such consolidation
or merger or the Person to which such sale, transfer, assignment, lease, conveyance or disposition is made shall be a
corporation organised and existing under the laws of the United States of America or a State thereof or the District of
Columbia or any European Union Member State (any such Person, the “Surviving Person”);

(b) the Surviving Person (if other than the Company) expressly assumes, by supplemental indenture in form satisfactory to the
Secured Notes Trustee, executed and delivered to the Secured Notes Trustee by such Surviving Person, all the obligations of
the Company, including the due and punctual performance and observance of all the covenants and conditions, including
covenants relating to payment of principal, interest, premium and Additional Amounts, of the Secured Indenture to be
performed by the Company;

(c) immediately before and after giving effect to such transaction or series of transactions on a Pro forma basis (and treating any
Debt which becomes, or is anticipated to become, an obligation of the Surviving Person or any Restricted Subsidiary as a result
such transaction or series of transactions as having been Incurred by the Surviving Person or such Restricted Subsidiary at the
time of such transaction or series of transactions), no Default or Event of Default shall have incurred and be continuing;

(d) immediately after giving effect to such transaction or series of transactions on a Pro forma basis (and treating any Debt which
becomes, or is anticipated to become, an obligation of the Surviving Person or any Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such
transaction or series of transactions as having been Incurred by the Surviving Person or such Restricted Subsidiary at the time
of such transaction or series of transactions), (i) the Company or the Surviving Person (if other than the Company) would be
able to Incur at least €1.00 of additional Debt under the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Certain
covenants—Limitation on Debt,” or (ii) the Consolidated Coverage Ratio would be greater than or equal to the Consolidated
Coverage Ratio immediately prior to giving pro forma effect to such transaction or transactions; and

(e) in connection with any consolidation, merger, transfer or other transaction contemplated by this provision, the Company shall
deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Secured Notes Trustee, in form satisfactory to the Secured Notes Trustee, an Officer’s
Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that such consolidation, merger, transfer or other transaction and the
supplemental indenture in respect thereto comply with this provision and that all conditions precedent herein provided for
relating to such transaction or transactions have been complied with.

Notwithstanding anything in this covenant to the contrary: (i) the Company (A) may merge with an Affiliate that has no material
assets or liabilities and that is incorporated or organized solely for the purpose of reincorporating or reorganizing the Company in any
state of the United States, the District of Columbia or any state which is a European Union Member State and (B) may otherwise
convert its legal form under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization, in each case, without complying with clause (d) of the
preceding paragraph and (ii) any transaction characterized as a merger under applicable law where each of the constituent entities
survives, shall not be treated as a merger for purposes of this covenant, but shall instead be treated as (x) an Asset Sale, if the result of
such transaction is the transfer of assets by the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, or (y) an Investment, if the result of such
transaction is the acquisition of assets by the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary.

Upon assumption by the Surviving Person of the obligations of the Company under the Secured Indenture, the Surviving Person
will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of the Company under the Secured Indenture, and the
predecessor (except in the case of a lease) and the Company will be released from its obligations under the Secured Indenture.

**_Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries_**

The Board of Directors of the Company may designate or redesignate any Subsidiary of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary
to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary if (i) the Subsidiary to be so designated does not own any Capital Stock, Redeemable Stock or Debt
of, or own or hold any Lien on any property or assets of, the Company or any other Restricted Subsidiary, (ii) the Subsidiary to be so
designated is not obligated by any Debt, Lien or other obligation that, if in default, would result (with the passage of time or notice or
otherwise) in a default on any Debt of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary and (iii) such designation complies with the
covenant described under “—Certain covenants—Limitation on Restricted Payments.” For purposes of the covenant described under

121


-----

“—Certain covenants—Limitation on Restricted Payments,” “Investment” will include the portion (proportionate to the Company’s
equity interest in a Restricted Subsidiary to be designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary) of the Fair Market Value of the net assets of
such Restricted Subsidiary at the time that such Restricted Subsidiary is designated an Unrestricted Subsidiary; _provided, however,_
that upon a redesignation of such Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary, the Company will be deemed to continue to have a permanent
“Investment” in an Unrestricted Subsidiary in an amount (if positive) equal to (a) the company’s “Investment” in such Subsidiary at
the time of such redesignation less (b) the portion (proportionate to the Company’s equity interest in such Subsidiary) of the Fair
Market Value of the net assets (as conclusively determined by the Board of Directors of the Company in good faith) of such
Subsidiary at the time that such Subsidiary is so re-designated a Restricted Subsidiary. Unless so designated as an Unrestricted
Subsidiary, any Person that becomes a Subsidiary of the Company or of any Restricted Subsidiary will be classified as a Restricted
Subsidiary. Except as provided in the first sentence of this paragraph, no Restricted Subsidiary may be redesignated as an Unrestricted
Subsidiary. Any such designation by the Board of Directors of the Company will be evidenced to the Secured Notes Trustee by the
Company by promptly filing with the Secured Notes Trustee a copy of the resolution of such Board giving effect to such designation
and delivering an Officer’s Certificate, in form satisfactory to the Secured Notes Trustee, certifying that such designation complies
with the foregoing provisions.

The Company will not, and will not permit any Unrestricted Subsidiary to, take any action or enter into any transaction or series of
transactions that would result in a Person becoming a Restricted Subsidiary (whether through an acquisition, the redesignation of an
Unrestricted Subsidiary or otherwise) unless after giving effect to such action, transaction or series of transactions, on a Pro forma
basis, (i)(a) the Company could Incur at least €1.00 of additional Debt pursuant to the first paragraph of the covenant described under
“—Certain covenants—Limitation on Debt,” or (b) the Consolidated Coverage Ratio would be greater than or equal to the
Consolidated Coverage Ratio immediately prior to giving Pro forma effect to such transaction or transactions and (ii) no Default or
Event of Default would occur or be continuing.

**_Impairment of security interest_**

(a) Subject to paragraph (b) below, the Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, take, or knowingly or
negligently omit to take, any action, which action or omission might or would have the result of materially impairing the
security interest with respect to the Collateral (it being understood, subject to the proviso below, that the Incurrence of
Permitted Liens relating to the Collateral securing the Secured Notes shall under no circumstances be deemed to materially
impair the security interest with respect to the Collateral) for the benefit of the Holders of Secured Notes, and the Company
will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, grant to any Person other than the Secured Notes Trustee or the
Security Trustee, for the benefit of the Holders, the Secured Notes Trustee, the Security Trustee and the other beneficiaries
described in the Security Documents, any interest whatsoever in any of the Collateral, except as permitted in the Security
Documents; provided, however, that in each case the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary may Incur Permitted Liens and the
Collateral may be discharged and released in accordance with the Secured Indenture.

(b) At the direction of the Company and without the consent of the Holders, the Security Trustee will from time to time enter into
one or more amendments to the Security Documents to: (i) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency therein, (ii)
provide for Permitted Liens, (iii) add to the Collateral, (iv) provide for the discharge and release of the Collateral in accordance
with the Secured Indenture or (v) make any other change thereto that does not adversely affect the Holders in any material
respect (including to permit the incurrence of Debt by the issuance of Additional Notes permitted to be incurred pursuant to the
covenant described under “Limitation on Debt” (any such issuance, an “Additional Notes Issuance”)); provided, however, that
no Security Document may be amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified or replaced, unless
in compliance with the Intercreditor Agreement and contemporaneously with such amendment, extension, renewal,
restatement, supplement, modification or replacement, the Company delivers to the Secured Notes Trustee either (1) a
solvency opinion, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Secured Notes Trustee from an Independent Appraiser
confirming the solvency of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to any
transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification or replacement, or (2) an
Opinion of Counsel, subject to customary limitations, in form and substance satisfactory to the Secured Notes Trustee
confirming that, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement,
supplement, modification or replacement, the Lien or Liens (other than in respect of Liens on assets that have been added to
the Collateral as a result of such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification or replacement)
securing the Secured Notes (other than any Additional Secured Notes) created under the Security Documents so amended,
extended, renewed, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified or replaced are valid and perfected Liens not otherwise

122


-----

subject to any limitation, imperfection or new hardening period (other than in the case of an Additional Notes Issuance), in
equity or at law, that such Lien or Liens were not otherwise subject to immediately prior to such amendment, extension,
renewal, restatement, supplement, modification or replacement.

**_Modification of the Intercompany Loans_**

The Company will not and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (i) to change the Stated Maturity of the principal of, or
any installment of interest on, the Intercompany Loans; (ii) to reduce the rate of interest on the Intercompany Loans to below the
interest rate of the Secured Notes; (iii) to change the currency for payment of any amount under the Intercompany Loans; (iv) to
prepay or otherwise reduce or permit the prepayment or reduction of the Intercompany Loans (save to facilitate a corresponding
payment of principal on the Secured Notes); (v) to assign or novate the Intercompany Loans (except as permitted under the Secured
Indenture); or (vi) to amend, modify or alter the Intercompany Loans in any manner materially adverse to the Holders of Secured
Notes, except as necessary to eliminate or minimize any present or future material tax, duty, levy, import, assessment or other material
governmental charge; or (vii) to take any action at any meeting in respect of the holders of the Intercompany Loans which may be
materially adverse to the interests of the Holders of the Secured Notes or have the effect of impairing the Intercompany Loans.

**_Suspension of Certain Covenants When Secured Notes Rated Investment Grade_**

If on any date following the date of the Secured Indenture, (1) the Secured Notes are rated (a) Baa3 or better by Moody’s and (b)
BBB- or better by S&P (or, if either Moody’s or S&P ceases to rate the Secured Notes for reasons outside of the control of the
Company, the equivalent investment grade credit rating from Fitch Ratings or, in the absence of such, any other “nationally
recognized statistical rating organization” within the meaning of Rule 15c3-1(c)(2)(vi)(F) under the U.S. Exchange Act selected by the
Company as a replacement agency so that the Secured Notes are so rated by at least two such credit rating agencies); and (2) no
Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, then, beginning on that day and subject to the provisions of the
following paragraph, the covenants specifically listed under the following captions in this listing memorandum will be suspended:

(1) “—Limitation on Debt”;

(2) “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”;

(3) “—Transactions with Affiliates”;

(4) “—Limitation on guarantees of Debt by Restricted Subsidiaries”;

(5) “—Limitation on restrictions on distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries”; and

(6) “—Limitation on sales of assets and Restricted Subsidiary stock.”

During any period that the foregoing covenants have been suspended, the Company’s Board of Directors may not designate any of
its Subsidiaries as Unrestricted Subsidiaries pursuant to the covenant described above under the caption “—Certain covenants—
Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries.”

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the rating assigned by any such Rating Agency should subsequently decline to below Baa3 or
BBB-, as applicable, the foregoing covenants will be reinstituted as of and from the date of such Rating Decline, and, upon any such
event, the Company shall promptly notify the Secured Notes Trustee. Such covenants will not, however, be of any effect with respect
to actions properly taken during the period of suspension. Calculations under the reinstated “—Certain covenants—Limitation on
Restricted Payments” covenant will be made as if the “—Certain covenants—Limitation on Restricted Payments” covenant had been
in effect since the date of the Secured Indenture except that no default will be deemed to have occurred by reason of a Restricted
Payment made while that covenant was suspended. There can be no assurance that the Secured Notes will ever achieve an investment
grade rating or that any such rating will be maintained.

**Defaults**

An “Event of Default” will occur under the Secured Indenture if:

123


-----

(i) the Company fails to make any payment of interest (including Additional Amounts) on any Secured Note when the same shall
become due and payable, and such failure continues for a period of 30 days;

(ii) the Company fails to make the payment of the principal or premium, if any, on any Secured Note when the same becomes due
and payable at its Stated Maturity, upon declaration, redemption, acceleration, required purchase or otherwise;

(iii) the Company fails to comply with any of its respective covenants or agreements described under “—Certain covenants—
Consolidation, merger and sale of assets;”

(iv) the Company fails to comply with its obligations under the covenants described under “—Change of Control” above or under
the covenants described under “—Certain covenants” (other than a failure to purchase Secured Notes which will constitute an
Event of Default under clause (ii) and other than a failure to comply with “—Certain covenants—Consolidation, merger and
sale of assets” which will constitute an Event of Default under clause (iii)) and such failure continues for a period of 30 days
after the notice specified below;

(v) the Company fails to comply with any of the covenants in the Secured Notes or the Secured Indenture (other than those
specified in clauses (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv)) and such failure continues for a period of 60 days after the notice specified below;

(vi) Debt of the Company or any Significant Restricted Subsidiary (or any other Restricted Subsidiary if such Debt is, or with the
giving of notice or the passage of time or otherwise may become, directly or indirectly, recourse to the Company or any
Significant Restricted Subsidiary) is not paid within any applicable grace period after final maturity or is accelerated by the
holders thereof and the total amount of such Debt unpaid or accelerated exceeds €20 million or its equivalent;

(vii) any judgment or decree aggregating in an uninsured amount in excess of €20 million or its equivalent at the time is rendered
against the Company or any Significant Restricted Subsidiary (or any other Restricted Subsidiary if such judgment or decree
is, or with the giving of notice or the passage of time or otherwise may become, directly or indirectly, recourse to the
Company or any Significant Restricted Subsidiary) and there is a period of 60 days following the entry of such judgment or
decree during which such judgment or decree is not discharged, waived or the execution thereof stayed or is not covered by
indemnities or third party insurance as to which the Person giving such indemnity or such insurer has not discharged
coverage and such default continues for ten days after the notice specified below;

(viii) the Company or any Significant Restricted Subsidiary pursuant to or within the meaning of any Bankruptcy Law (A)
commences a voluntary case, (B) consents to the entry of an order for relief against it in an involuntary case, (C) consents to
the appointment of a Custodian of it or for any substantial part of its property or (D) makes a general assignment for the
benefit of its creditors; or takes any comparable action under any laws relating to insolvency or laws having a similar effect
for creditors;

(ix) a court of competent jurisdiction enters an order or decree under any Bankruptcy Law that: (A) is for relief against the
Company or any Significant Restricted Subsidiary in an involuntary case, (B) appoints a Custodian of the Company or any
Significant Restricted Subsidiary or for any substantial part of its property, or (C) orders the winding up or liquidation of the
Company or any Significant Restricted Subsidiary; or any similar relief is granted under any foreign laws, and, in each case,
the order or decree remains unstayed and in effect for 60 days;

(x) any Secured Note Guarantee ceases to be, or is asserted by any Secured Note Guarantor, or any Person acting on behalf of any
Secured Note Guarantor, not to be in full force and effect or enforceable in accordance with its terms (other than as provided
for in the Secured Indenture or any Secured Note Guarantee) and any such Default continues uncured for a period of 21 days;
or

(xi) the security interest purported to be created under any Security Document, at any time, ceases to be in full force and effect and
to constitute a valid and perfected Lien with the priority required by the applicable Security Document and/or the Intercreditor
Agreement for any reason other than the satisfaction in full of all obligations under the Secured Indenture and discharge of the
Secured Indenture or in accordance with the terms of the Secured Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement or any security
interest purported to be created under any Security Document is declared invalid or unenforceable or any Person granting any

124


-----

such security interest asserts in any pleading in any court of competent jurisdiction that any such security interest is invalid or
unenforceable and (but only in the event that such failure to be in full force and effect or such assertion is capable of being
cured without imposing any new hardening period, in equity or at law, that such security interest was not otherwise subject
immediately prior to such failure or assertion) such failure to be in full force and effect or such assertion has continued
uncured for a period of 21 days; provided, however, that any such cessation, declaration, or assertion shall not constitute a
Default hereunder unless it shall adversely affect in a material respect the condition or the value of the Collateral, taken as a
whole.

A Default under clause (iv) or (v) will not be an Event of Default until the Secured Notes Trustee notifies the Company or the
Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Secured Notes then outstanding notify the Company and the Secured
Notes Trustee in writing of the Default and the Company does not cure such Default within the time specified after receipt of such
notice. Such notice must specify the Default, demand that it be remedied and state that such notice is a “Notice of Default.”

For the avoidance of doubt, the voluntary liquidation or dissolution of a Significant Restricted Subsidiary in connection with the
transfer of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of such Significant Restricted Subsidiary to another Significant Restricted
Subsidiary in compliance with the terms of the Secured Indenture shall not constitute an Event of Default.

The Company will deliver to the Secured Notes Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice in the form of
an Officer’s Certificate of any event which, with the giving of notice and the lapse of time, would become an Event of Default under
clause (iv) or (v), its status and what action the Company is taking or proposes to take with respect thereto.

If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default specified in clause (viii) or (ix)) occurs and is continuing, the Secured Notes
Trustee, by notice in writing to the Company, or the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Secured Notes then
outstanding by notice to the Company and the Secured Notes Trustee, may declare the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued
interest on all Secured Notes to be due and payable and instruct the Security Trustee to enforce the transaction security. Upon such
declaration, such principal accrued interest will be due and payable immediately. If an Event of Default specified in clause (viii) or
(ix) occurs, the principal of and interest on all the Secured Notes will ipso facto become and be immediately due and payable without
any declaration or other act on the part of the Secured Notes Trustee or any Holders of the Secured Notes and the transaction security
will ipso facto become immediately enforceable. After any such acceleration, but before a judgment or decree based on such
acceleration is obtained by the Secured Notes Trustee, the registered Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the
Secured Notes then outstanding may, under certain circumstances, rescind and annul such acceleration if all Events of Default, other
than the nonpayment of accelerated principal, premium or interest, have been cured or waived as provided in the Secured Indenture.

The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Secured Notes by notice to the Secured Notes Trustee may waive
an existing Default and its consequences except (i) a Default in the payment of the principal of, premium if any, or interest on a
Secured Note or (ii) a Default in respect of a provision that cannot be amended without the consent of Holders of a percentage higher
than 50.1% of the aggregate principal amount of Secured Notes affected. When a Default is waived, it is deemed cured, but no such
waiver will extend to any subsequent or other Default or impair any consequent right.

The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Secured Notes may direct the time, method and place of conducting
any proceeding for any remedy available to the Secured Notes Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Secured
Notes Trustee. However, the Secured Notes Trustee may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Secured
Indenture or that the Secured Notes Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of other Holders or would involve the
Secured Notes Trustee in personal liability; _provided, however, that the Secured Notes Trustee may take any other action deemed_
proper by the Secured Notes Trustee that is not inconsistent with such direction. Prior to taking any action under the Secured
Indenture, the Secured Notes Trustee will be entitled to indemnification satisfactory to it in its sole discretion against all losses and
expenses caused by taking or not taking such action.

A Holder of Secured Notes may not pursue any remedy with respect to the Secured Indenture or the Secured Notes unless: (i) such
Holder gives to the Secured Notes Trustee written notice stating that an Event of Default is continuing; (ii) Holders of at least 25% in
aggregate principal amount of the Secured Notes then outstanding make a written request to the Secured Notes Trustee to pursue the
remedy; (iii) such Holder or Holders offer to the Secured Notes Trustee reasonable security or indemnity against any loss, liability or
expense; (iv) the Secured Notes Trustee does not comply with the request within 60 days after receipt of the request and the offer of

125


-----

security or indemnity; and (v) the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Secured Notes do not give the Secured Notes
Trustee a written direction inconsistent with the request during such 60-day period.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Secured Note Guarantees and Security Documents may only be enforced by or, as the case may
be, at the discretion of the Secured Notes Trustee (acting of its own volition or on the direction of the Holders of a majority in
principal amount of the outstanding Secured Notes) (see “—Credit enhancement”).

**Amendments and waivers**

Subject to certain exceptions, the Secured Indenture, the Secured Notes, the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents
may be amended or supplemented with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Secured
Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a consent solicitation, tender offer or exchange for the
Secured Notes) and any existing or past default or compliance with any provisions may be waived with the consent of the Holders of
at least a majority in an aggregate principal amount of the Secured Notes then outstanding. However, without the consent of Holders
of at least 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Secured Notes affected thereby, no amendment may, among other
things, (i) reduce the amount of Secured Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment, (ii) reduce the rate of or extend the time
for payment of interest on any Secured Note, (iii) reduce the principal of or extend the Stated Maturity of any Secured Note, (iv)
reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any Secured Note or change the time or times at which any Secured Notes may or
shall be redeemed, (v) make any Secured Note payable in money other than that stated in the Secured Note, (vi) impair the right of any
Holder of Secured Notes to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment on or with respect to any Secured Notes, or (vii) release
any security that may have been granted in respect of the Secured Notes other than pursuant to the terms of the Security Documents,
the Intercreditor Agreement or as otherwise permitted under the Secured Indenture. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Secured
Indenture may be amended with the consent of Holders of 66 2/3% of the aggregate principal amount of outstanding Secured Notes to
release a Secured Note Guarantee (if such consent is required by the Secured Indenture).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any Holder of the Secured Notes, the Company, the Secured Note
Guarantors, the Security Trustee and the Secured Notes Trustee may, among other things, amend or supplement the Secured
Indenture, the Secured Notes, the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents to cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or
inconsistency, to provide for the assumption by a Surviving Person of the obligations of the Company under the Secured Indenture, to
provide for the issuance of Additional Secured Notes in accordance with the limitations set forth in the Secured Indenture and to make
such changes as may be required to the Security Documents to accommodate and implement such issuance of Additional Secured
Notes, to the extent necessary to provide for the granting of a security interest for the benefit of any Person, provided that the granting
of such security interest is not prohibited under the Secured Indenture, to provide for uncertificated Secured Notes in addition to or in
place of certificated Secured Notes, evidence and provide for the acceptance and appointment under the Secured Indenture of a
successor trustee pursuant to the requirements thereof, comply with the rules of any applicable securities depository, conform the text
of the Secured Indenture, the Secured Notes, the Secured Note Guarantees, the Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents to
any provision of the description of the Secured Notes to the extent that such provision in the description of the Secured Notes was
intended to be a verbatim recitation of a provision of the Secured Indenture, the Secured Notes, the Secured Note Guarantees, the
Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents, to add Secured Note Guarantees with respect to the Secured Notes or release a
Secured Note Guarantor upon its designation as an Unrestricted Subsidiary or as otherwise permitted by the Secured Indenture;
_provided, however, that the release is in accord with the applicable provisions of the Secured Indenture, to secure the Secured Notes_
and to amend the mechanical provisions to facilitate release of all or any portion of the Collateral pursuant to the terms of the Secured
Indenture, to add to the covenants of the Company for the benefit of the Holders of the Secured Notes or to surrender any right or
power conferred upon the Company, or make any change that does not adversely affect the rights of any Holder of the Secured Notes.

The consent of the Holders of the Secured Notes is not necessary under the Secured Indenture to approve the particular form of
any proposed amendment. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the proposed amendment. A consent to any
amendment or waiver under the Secured Indenture by any Holder of Secured Notes given in connection with a tender of such Holder’s
Secured Notes will not be rendered invalid by such tender.

After an amendment under the Secured Indenture becomes effective, the Company is required to mail to each registered Holder of
the Secured Notes at its address appearing in the security register a notice briefly describing such amendment. However, the failure to
give such notice to all Holders of the Secured Notes, or any defect therein, will not impair or affect the validity of the amendment.

126


-----

**Amendments to the Intercreditor Agreements**

The Secured Indenture will provide that, at the direction of the Company and without the consent of the Holders of Secured Notes,
the Secured Notes Trustee shall from time to time enter into one or more amendments to the Intercreditor Agreement to (A) cure any
ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency of the Intercreditor Agreement, (B) increase the amount of Debt of the types covered by
the Intercreditor Agreement that may be Incurred by the Company or a Secured Note Guarantor that is subject to the Intercreditor
Agreement (including the addition of provisions relating to new Debt ranking junior in right of payment to the Secured Notes or the
Secured Note Guarantees, as applicable), (C) add Secured Note Guarantors to the Intercreditor Agreement, (D) further secure the
Secured Notes (including Additional Secured Notes), or (E) make any other such change to the Intercreditor Agreement that does not
adversely affect the Holders of Secured Notes in any material respect.

The Company shall not otherwise direct the Secured Notes Trustee to enter into any amendment to the Intercreditor Agreement
without the consent of the Holders of the majority in aggregate principal amount of the Secured Notes then outstanding, except as
otherwise permitted under this covenant, and the Company may only direct the Secured Notes Trustee to enter into any amendment to
the extent that such amendment does not impose any personal obligations on the Secured Notes Trustee or adversely affect the rights,
duties, liabilities or immunities of the Secured Notes Trustee under the Secured Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement.

Each Holder of Secured Notes, by accepting a Secured Note, shall be deemed to have agreed to and accepted the terms and
conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement (whether then entered into or entered into in the future pursuant to the provisions described
herein). A copy of the Intercreditor Agreement shall be made available for inspection during normal business hours on any Business
Day upon prior written request at the offices of the Secured Notes Trustee and, for so long as any Secured Notes are listed on the
Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, at the offices of the
Paying Agent in Luxembourg.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Secured Indenture (and all Liens on Collateral created pursuant to the Security Documents) and the Secured Note Guarantees
will be discharged and will cease to be of further effect (except as otherwise expressly provided for in the Secured Indenture) when
either (i) all outstanding Secured Notes have been delivered (other than lost, stolen or destroyed Secured Notes which have been
replaced) to the Secured Notes Trustee for cancellation or (ii) all outstanding Secured Notes not theretofore delivered to the Secured
Notes Trustee for cancellation have become due and payable by reason of the making of a notice of redemption or otherwise or will
become due and payable by reason of the making of a notice of redemption or otherwise within one year and the Company has
irrevocably deposited with the Secured Notes Trustee cash in euro or euro-denominated European Government Obligations or a
combination thereof sufficient to pay at maturity or upon redemption all outstanding Secured Notes, including interest thereon (other
than lost, stolen or destroyed Secured Notes which have been replaced), and, in either case, the Company has paid all sums payable by
it under the Secured Indenture. The Secured Notes Trustee will be required to acknowledge satisfaction and discharge of the Secured
Indenture on written demand of the Company accompanied by an Officer’s Certificate at the cost and expense of the Company.

**Defeasance**

The Company may, at any time, terminate (i) all obligations under the Secured Notes, the Secured Note Guarantees and the
Secured Indenture (“legal defeasance option”) or (ii) obligations to comply with certain restrictive covenants, including certain of the
covenants described under “—Certain covenants” (“covenant defeasance option”). The Company may exercise its legal defeasance
option notwithstanding any prior exercise of their covenant defeasance option.

If the Company exercises its legal defeasance option, payment of the Secured Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of
Default. If the Company exercises its covenant defeasance option, payment of the Secured Notes may not be accelerated because of
certain Events of Default described under “—Defaults” (not including, among others, Events of Default relating to nonpayment,
bankruptcy and insolvency events) or because of the failure of the Company to comply with certain covenants specified in the Secured
Indenture. If the Company exercises its legal defeasance option or its covenant defeasance option, each Secured Note Guarantor will
be released from all of its obligations with respect to its Secured Note Guarantee and the Collateral will be released as security for the
Secured Notes.

127


-----

The Company may exercise its legal defeasance option or its covenant defeasance option only if (1) the Company irrevocably
deposits in trust with the Secured Notes Trustee cash in euro or euro-denominated European Government Obligations or a
combination thereof, for the payment of principal of and interest on the Secured Notes to maturity or redemption, as the case may be;
(2) the Company delivers to the Secured Notes Trustee a certificate from a nationally recognized firm of independent certified public
accountants expressing their opinion that the payments of principal and interest when due and without reinvestment will provide cash
at such times and in such amounts as will be sufficient to pay principal and interest when due on all the Secured Notes to maturity or
redemption, as the case may be; (3) 184 days pass after the deposit is made and during the 184-day period, no Default described in
clause (vii) or (viii) under “—Defaults” occurs which is continuing at the end of the period; (4) the deposit does not constitute a
default under any other agreement or instrument binding on the Company; (5) the Company delivers to the Secured Notes Trustee an
Opinion of Counsel satisfactory to the Secured Notes Trustee in its sole discretion to the effect that the trust resulting from the deposit
does not constitute, or is qualified as, a regulated investment company under the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended;
(6) in the case of the legal defeasance option, the Company delivers to the Secured Notes Trustee an Opinion of Counsel satisfactory
to the Secured Notes Trustee in its sole discretion stating that (i) the Company has received from, or there has been published by, the
U.S. Internal Revenue Service a ruling, or (ii) since the date of the Secured Indenture there has been a change in the applicable U.S.
federal income tax law, to the effect, in either case, that, and based thereon such Opinion of Counsel shall confirm that, the Holders of
the Secured Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such defeasance and will
be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if
such defeasance had not occurred, _provided, however, such Opinion of Counsel shall not be required if all the Secured Notes will_
become due and payable on the Maturity Date within one year or are to be called for redemption within one year under arrangements
satisfactory to the Secured Notes Trustee; (7) in the case of the covenant defeasance option, the Company delivers to the Secured
Notes Trustee an Opinion of Counsel satisfactory to the Secured Notes Trustee in its sole discretion to the effect that the Holders of
the Secured Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such covenant defeasance
and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the
case if such covenant defeasance had not occurred; and (8) the Company delivers to the Secured Notes Trustee an Officer’s Certificate
and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent relating to the defeasance and discharge of the Secured Notes
have been complied with as required by the Secured Indenture.

**Notices**

Notices to Holders of Secured Notes (while any Secured Notes are represented by one or more global notes) shall be delivered to
Euroclear and Clearstream for communication to entitled account holders, or in the case of definitive Secured Notes, shall be given by
mail to the addresses of Holders of such Secured Notes appearing on the register for such Secured Note, and in each case shall be
published (so long as the Secured Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the rules of that
exchange so require) in a leading newspaper having general circulation in Luxembourg (which is expected to be the d’Wort) or on the
website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange at www.bourse.lu.

**No personal liability of directors, officers, employees and stockholders**

No past, present or future director, officer, employee, incorporator, promoter, advisor or stockholder of the Company or any
Secured Note Guarantor, as such, will have any liability for any obligations of the Company or the Secured Note Guarantors under the
Secured Notes, the Secured Indenture, the Secured Note Guarantees, the Security Documents or for any claim based on, in respect of,
or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each Holder of Secured Notes by accepting a Secured Note waives and releases all
such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Secured Notes.

**Concerning the Secured Notes Trustee**

Deutsche Trustee Company Limited will be the Secured Notes Trustee under the Secured Indenture. The Secured Notes Trustee’s
current specified address is Winchester House, 1 Great Winchester Street, London EC2N 2DB.

The Secured Indenture will provide that, except during the continuance of an Event of Default, the Secured Notes Trustee will
perform only such duties as are specifically set forth in the Secured Indenture. During the existence of an Event of Default, the
Secured Notes Trustee will exercise such rights and powers vested in it by the Secured Indenture, and use the same degree of care and
skill in its exercise as a prudent man would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of his own affairs.

128


-----

Subject to such provisions, the Secured Notes Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers under the
Secured Indenture (including, without limitation, directing the Security Trustee to enforce any of the Security Documents) at the
request of any Holder of Secured Notes, unless such Holder has offered to the Secured Notes Trustee security and/or indemnity
satisfactory to it against loss, liability or expense as provided in the Secured Indenture.

The Secured Indenture provides for the indemnification of the Secured Notes Trustee and for its relief from responsibility in
connection with its actions under the Secured Indenture. The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Secured Notes Trustee is
entitled to be paid amounts in respect of its fees, costs and expenses and claims under any indemnity in priority to payments to other
creditors, including Holders of the notes. The Secured Indenture will provide that the Secured Notes Trustee may rely absolutely,
without further enquiry, on any certificates, reports, opinions or other documents (whether or not any such document contains any
limit on liability) from the Company, its subsidiaries, legal counsel, auditors, valuers and/or any other experts. The Secured Notes
Trustee will not be responsible for the adequacy or fitness of any of the Collateral as security in relation to the notes. The Secured
Notes Trustee will not be responsible for any loss, expense or liability which may be suffered as a result of any inadequacy of the
Collateral.

The Secured Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement will contain certain limitations on the rights of the Secured Notes Trustee,
should it become a creditor of the Company, to obtain payments of claims in certain cases or to realize on certain property received in
respect of any such claim as security or otherwise. The Secured Notes Trustee will be permitted to engage in other transactions;
provided that if the Secured Notes Trustee acquires any conflicting interest, it must eliminate such conflict or resign.

**DESCRIPTION OF THE UNSECURED NOTES**

Lecta S.A. will issue the Unsecured Notes under an indenture (the “Unsecured Indenture”) dated February 13, 2007 among itself,
the Unsecured Note Guarantors, Deutsche Trustee Company Limited, as trustee for the Unsecured Notes (the “Unsecured Notes
Trustee”), and other parties named therein. The terms of the Unsecured Notes are stated in the Unsecured Indenture. The Unsecured
Notes will be denominated in euro and bear interest with reference to EURIBOR as described below. The Unsecured Indenture is
unlimited in aggregate principal amount, although the issuance of Unsecured Notes on the Issue Date (as defined below) will be
limited to €150.0 million.

Certain terms used in this description are defined under the heading “—Certain definitions.” In this description of Unsecured
Notes: (i) the “Company” refers only to Lecta S.A. and not to any of its Subsidiaries; and (ii) “Unsecured Note Guarantor” refers only
to such Unsecured Note Guarantor and not to any of its Subsidiaries.

The following description is only a summary of the material provisions of the Unsecured Indenture. It does not restate the
Unsecured Indenture in its entirety. You should read the Unsecured Indenture because it, not this description, defines your rights as
Holders. You may request copies of the Unsecured Indenture at the address set forth under the heading “Where you can find more
information” and, for so long as Unsecured Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the rules of
the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, may inspect copies of such documents at the office of the paying agent in Luxembourg.

**Brief description of the Unsecured Notes**

The Unsecured Notes:

   - will be senior unsecured obligations of the Company;

   - will rank _pari passu_ in right of payment with all existing and future Debt of the Company that is not subordinated to the
Unsecured Notes;

   - will rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future Subordinated Obligations of the Company;

   - will be structurally subordinated to all liabilities (including trade payables), disqualified stock and preferred stock of the
Company’s Subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Unsecured Notes;

   - will be guaranteed on a senior basis by certain Subsidiaries of the Company as described below (see “—Unsecured Note
Guarantees” and Annex A to this listing memorandum); and

   - will be effectively subordinated in right of payment to all existing and future secured debt of the Company and any Guarantor,
including the Secured Notes and indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Facility, to the extent of such secured debt.

Because of legal restrictions, not all of the Subsidiaries will guarantee the Unsecured Notes, and certain of the guarantees are
subject to significant limitations.

Condat Holding and Condat are borrowers or guarantors under the Revolving Credit Facility but are not Unsecured Note
Guarantors. As a result, lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility may be able to assert claims for repayment against such
Subsidiaries with respect to which Holders of the Unsecured Notes would have no direct claims for repayment.

As of the date of the Unsecured Indenture, all of the Company’s Subsidiaries will be “Restricted Subsidiaries.” However, under the
circumstances described below under the definition of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, the Company will be permitted to designate certain
of its Subsidiaries as “Unrestricted Subsidiaries.” Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants in the
Unsecured Indenture. Those of the Company’s Subsidiaries that are Unsecured Note Guarantors are all Restricted Subsidiaries and,
subject in each case to significant limitations under applicable law (as more specifically set out below under “Unsecured Note
Guarantees”), will be jointly and severally liable with respect to the Company’s obligations under the Unsecured Notes.

147


-----

The Company is a holding company with limited assets and operates its business through its Subsidiaries. Any right of the
Company and its creditors, including Holders of the Unsecured Notes, to participate in the assets of any of the Company’s
Subsidiaries that is not an Unsecured Note Guarantor upon the bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization of any such Subsidiary will
(except insofar as the Company has a claim against such Subsidiary for intercompany debt) be subject to the prior claims of the
creditors of such Subsidiary, including but not limited to trade creditors. Claims by the Unsecured Notes Trustee against an Unsecured
Note Guarantor on behalf of the Holders of the Unsecured Notes will be direct claims on that Unsecured Note Guarantor. However,
some of the Unsecured Note Guarantors are themselves holding companies, and hence claims under an Unsecured Note Guarantee
will be structurally subordinated to the prior claims of the creditors of the Subsidiaries of such Unsecured Note Guarantors, including
but not limited to trade creditors.

**Principal, Maturity and Interest**

The Company will issue the Unsecured Notes in an initial aggregate principal amount of €150.0 million. The Company will issue
the Unsecured Notes in denominations of €50,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 above €50,000. Unsecured Notes in denominations
of less than €50,000 will not be available. The Unsecured Notes will mature on February 15, 2014 at a redemption price of 100%.
Subject to the Company’s compliance with the covenant described under the heading “—Certain covenants—Limitation on debt,” the
Company is permitted to issue additional notes from time to time under the Unsecured Indenture in an unlimited principal amount (the
“Additional Unsecured Notes”). The Unsecured Notes and the Additional Unsecured Notes, if any, will be treated as a single class for
all purposes of the Unsecured Indenture, including waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase. Unless the context
otherwise requires, for all purposes of the Unsecured Indenture and this “Description of Unsecured Notes,” references to the
Unsecured Notes include any Additional Unsecured Notes actually issued.

The Unsecured Notes will bear interest at a rate per annum (the “Applicable Rate”), reset quarterly, equal to EURIBOR plus 400.0
bps as determined by the calculation agent for the Unsecured Notes (the “Calculation Agent”), which will initially be Deutsche Bank
AG, London Branch, or any successor thereof.

Interest on the Unsecured Notes will be payable quarterly in arrears on each Interest Payment Date commencing May 15, 2007, to
the person in whose name the Unsecured Note is registered on the relevant Record Date. Interest on the Unsecured Notes will accrue
from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or, if no interest has been paid, from and including the Issue Date.

_“Determination Date” with respect to an Interest Period will be the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days preceding the first_
day of such Interest Period.

_“EURIBOR,” with respect to an Interest Period, will be the rate (expressed as a percentage per annum) for deposits in euro for a_
three-month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days after the Determination Date that appears on Telerate
Page 248 as of 11:00 a.m., Brussels time, on the Determination Date. If Telerate Page 248 does not include such a rate or is
unavailable on a Determination Date, the Calculation Agent will request the principal London office of each of four major banks in the
Euro- zone inter-bank market, as selected by the Calculation Agent, to provide such bank’s offered quotation (expressed as a
percentage per annum) as of approximately 11:00 a.m., Brussels time, on such Determination Date, to prime banks in the Euro-zone
inter-bank market for deposits in a Representative Amount in euro for a three-month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET
Settlement Days after the Determination Date. If at least two such offered quotations are so provided, the rate for the Interest Period
will be the arithmetic mean of such quotations. If fewer than two such quotations are so provided, the Calculation Agent will request
each of three major banks in London, as selected by the Calculation Agent (“Reference Banks”), to provide such bank’s rate
(expressed as a percentage per annum), as of approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on such Determination Date, for loans in a
Representative Amount in euro to leading European banks for a three-month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET
Settlement Days after the Determination Date. If at least two such rates are so provided, the rate for the Interest Period will be the
arithmetic mean of such rates. If fewer than two such rates are so provided then the rate for the Interest Period will be the rate in effect
with respect to the immediately preceding Interest Period.

_“Euro-zone” means the region comprised of member states of the European Union that adopt the euro._

_“Interest Payment Date” means February 15, May 15, August 15, and November 15 in each year from and including May 15,_
2007. If any Interest Payment Date would otherwise fall on a day which is not a Business Day, it shall be postponed to the next day

148


-----

which is a Business Day unless it would then fall into the next calendar month, in which event, the Interest Payment Date shall be
brought forward to the immediately preceding Business Day.

_“Interest Period” means each successive period commencing on, and including, an Interest Payment Date and ending on, but_
excluding, the next succeeding Interest Payment Date, with the exception that the first Interest Period will commence on, and include,
the Issue Date and end on, but exclude, May 15, 2007 and the final Interest Period shall end on, but exclude, the date of final maturity.

_“Representative Amount” means the greater of (a) €1,000,000 and (b) an amount that is representative for a single transaction in_
the relevant market at the relevant time.

_“TARGET Settlement Day” means any day on which the Trans-European Automated Real-Time Gross Settlement Express_
Transfer (TARGET) System is open.

_“Telerate Page 248” means, the display page so designated on Bridge’s Telerate Service (or such other page as may replace that_
page on that service, or such other service as may be nominated as the information vendor).

The Calculation Agent will, as soon as practicable after 11:00 a.m. (Brussels time) or the Quotation Time (as the case may be) on
each Determination Date, determine the Applicable Rate, and calculate the aggregate amount of interest payable on the Unsecured
Notes in respect of the following Interest Period (the “Interest Amount”). The Interest Amount will be calculated by applying the
Applicable Rate to the principal amount of Unsecured Notes outstanding at the commencement of the Interest Period, multiplying
each such amount by the actual number of days in the Interest Period concerned divided by 360.

All percentages resulting from any of the above calculations will be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one hundred thousandth
of a percentage point, with five one-millionths of a percentage point being rounded upwards (e.g., 4.876545% (or .04876545) being
rounded to 4.87655% (or .0487655)). All euro amounts used in or resulting from such calculations will be rounded to the nearest euro
cent (with one-half euro cent being rounded upwards). The determination of the Applicable Rate and the Interest Amount by the
Calculation Agent shall, in the absence of willful default, bad faith or manifest error, be binding on all parties.

The interest rate on the Unsecured Notes will in no event be higher than the maximum rate permitted by New York law as the
same may be modified by any United States law of general application.

Upon each determination of interest rate, so long as the Unsecured Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock
Exchange and admitted for trading on the Euro MTF Market of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, to the extent required by the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange, the Company will inform Holders thereof through the relevant clearing systems and will make such
determination available during normal business hours at the offices of the paying agent in Luxembourg. The Calculation Agent will,
upon the request of the Holder of any Unsecured Note, provide the interest rate then in effect with respect to the Unsecured Notes.

The rights of Holders of beneficial interests in the Unsecured Notes to receive the payments of interest on the Unsecured Notes are
subject to applicable procedures of the book-entry depositary and Euroclear and Clearstream.

**Optional redemption**

The Unsecured Notes will not be redeemable at the option of the Company prior to February 15, 2008, except as described in “—
Optional tax redemption.” On and after such date, the Unsecured Notes will be redeemable at the option of the Company, at any time
as a whole, or from time to time in part, on not less than 30 nor more than 60 days’ notice delivered to each Holder in accordance with
the provisions set forth under “—Notices,” at the following Redemption Prices (expressed as percentages of principal amount), plus
accrued and unpaid interest (if any) to the redemption date, if redeemed during the 12-month period commencing on February 15 of
the years set forth below:

**Redemption**
**Year** **Price**
2008........................... 101.0%
2009 and thereafter.... 100.0%

149


-----

The Company may acquire Unsecured Notes by means other than a redemption, whether by tender offer, open market purchases,
negotiated transactions or otherwise, in accordance with applicable securities laws, so long as such acquisition does not otherwise
violate the terms of the Unsecured Indenture.

**Selection and notice of redemption**

If less than all the Unsecured Notes are to be redeemed, the particular Unsecured Notes to be redeemed will be selected not more
than 60 days prior to the redemption date by the Unsecured Notes Trustee by such method as the Unsecured Notes Trustee will deem
fair and appropriate or in such manner as complies with the requirements of the principal securities exchange, if any, on which the
Unsecured Notes being redeemed are listed and the requirements of any depositary holding the global certificates representing the
Unsecured Notes; provided however, that no Unsecured Note of €50,000 in original principal shall be redeemed in part.

If any Unsecured Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that Unsecured Note will state the
portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. The Company will issue a new Unsecured Note in a principal amount equal to
the unredeemed portion of the original Unsecured Note in the name of the Holder upon cancellation of the original Unsecured Note.

Subject to the terms of the applicable redemption notice, Unsecured Notes called for redemption become due on the date fixed for
redemption. On and after the redemption date, interest will cease to accrue on the Unsecured Notes or portions thereof called for
redemption (unless the Company defaults in providing the funds for such redemption) and such Unsecured Notes will cease to be
outstanding.

So long as any Unsecured Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted to trading on the
Euro MTF Market of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, the Company
will provide a copy of all notices to the Luxembourg Stock Exchange.

**Sinking Fund**

The Company is not required to make mandatory sinking fund payments with respect to the Unsecured Notes.

**Additional Amounts**

The Company and each Unsecured Note Guarantor is required to make all payments under or with respect to the Unsecured Notes
or its Unsecured Note Guarantee free and clear of and without withholding or deduction for or on account of any present or future tax,
duty, levy, impost, assessment or other governmental charge of whatever nature (including penalties, interest and other liabilities
related thereto) (hereinafter “Taxes”), unless the withholding or deduction is required by law.

If any deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of (1) the government of any of
the countries in which any of the Company or the relevant Unsecured Note Guarantor and, in each case, any successor thereof (each, a
“Payor”) is organized or any political subdivision or any authority or agency therein or thereof having power to tax, (2) any other
jurisdiction in which a Payor is otherwise resident for tax purposes, or (3) any jurisdiction from or through which any payment under
or with respect to the Unsecured Notes or any Unsecured Note Guarantee is made (each, a “Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction”) will at any
time be required from any payment made under or with respect to the Unsecured Notes or an Unsecured Note Guarantee, as
applicable, such Payor will be required to pay such additional amounts (“Additional Amounts”) as may be necessary so that the net
amount received in respect of such payments by any Holder after such withholding or deduction (including any such deduction or
withholding from such Additional Amounts) will equal the amount such Holder would have received if such Taxes had not been
withheld or deducted; provided, however, that the foregoing obligation to pay Additional Amounts does not apply to (1) any Taxes
that would not have been imposed but for the existence of any present or former connection between the relevant Holder (or between a
fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member or shareholder of, or possessor of power over, the relevant Holder, if the relevant Holder is an
estate, nominee, partnership, limited liability corporation, trust or corporation) and the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction, including such
Holder (or such fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, partner, member, shareholder, or possessor) of the Unsecured Notes being or having
been a citizen, resident, or national thereof or being or having been present or engaged in a trade or business therein or having or
having had a permanent establishment therein, other than a connection resulting from the mere receipt of such payment or the
ownership, holding or enforcement of such Unsecured Note; (2) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, excise, transfer, personal property
tax or similar Tax; (3) any withholding or deduction in respect of the Unsecured Notes or any Unsecured Note Guarantee (a) where

150


-----

such withholding or deduction is imposed on a payment or an individual and is required to be made pursuant to European Council
Directive 2003/48/EC or any other Directive implementing the conclusions of the ECOFIN Council meeting of 26th-27th November
2000 on the taxation of savings income or any law implementing or complying with, or introduced in order to conform to, such
Directive, or (b) presented (where presentation is required) for payment by or on behalf of a Holder who would have been able to
avoid such withholding or deduction by presenting the Unsecured Notes to any other paying agent in a European Union Member
State, or (c) where the payment could have been made without such deduction or withholding if the Unsecured Notes had been
presented for payment (where presentation is required) within 30 days (i) after the date on which such payment became due and
payable, or (ii) the date on which payment thereof is duly provided for, whichever is later (except to the extent that the Holder would
have been entitled to Additional Amounts had the Unsecured Notes been presented during such 30-day period); (4) any Taxes
imposed with respect to any payment of principal of (or premium, if any, on) or interest on the Unsecured Notes by a Payor to any
Holder who is a fiduciary or partnership or any Person other than the sole beneficial owner of such payment, to the extent that a
beneficiary or settlor with respect to such fiduciary, a member of such a partnership or the beneficial owner of such payment would
not have been entitled to the Additional Amounts had such beneficiary, settlor, member or beneficial owner been the actual Holder of
such Unsecured Notes; (5) any Taxes that are payable other than by deduction or withholding from payments made under or with
respect to the Unsecured Notes; (6) any Taxes that would not have been imposed but for the failure of the Holder and/or beneficial
owner to comply with the Payor’s or the paying agent’s reasonable and timely request in accordance with the “—Notices” provision
herein, to the Holder to provide certification, documentation, information or other evidence concerning the nationality, residence,
identity or connection with the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction of the Holder and/or beneficial owner of such Unsecured Notes or to
make any valid or timely declaration or similar claim or satisfy any other reporting requirement relating to such matters, whether
required or imposed by statute, treaty, regulation or administrative practice of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction, as a precondition to
exemption from, or reduction in the rate of withholding or deduction of, Taxes imposed by the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction; or (7)
any combination of any of the above.

Such Additional Amounts also will not be payable where, had the beneficial owner of the Unsecured Note been the Holder, it
would not have been entitled to payment of Additional Amounts by reason of clauses (1) to (7) inclusive above.

The Payor will (i) make any required withholding or deduction and (ii) remit the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant
Taxing Jurisdiction in accordance with applicable law. The Payor will use all reasonable efforts to provide the Unsecured Notes
Trustee with certified copies of tax receipts (or, if such certified copies are not available using all reasonable efforts, such other
evidence reasonably acceptable to the Unsecured Notes Trustee in its discretion), evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or
withheld from each Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes. The Payor will attach to each certified copy (or other
documentation) a certificate stating (x) that the amount of such Tax evidenced by the certified copy (or other documentation) was paid
in connection with payments in respect of the principal amount of Unsecured Notes then outstanding and (y) the amount of such Tax
paid per €1,000 of principal amount of the Unsecured Notes.

At least 30 days prior to each date on which any payment under or with respect to the Unsecured Notes or any Unsecured Note
Guarantee, as the case may be, is due and payable (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises shortly before or after the
30th day prior to such date, in which case it shall be promptly thereafter), if the Payor will be obligated to pay Additional Amounts
with respect to such payment, the Payor will deliver to the Unsecured Notes Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that such
Additional Amounts will be payable and the amounts so payable and will set forth such other information necessary to enable the
Unsecured Notes Trustee to pay such Additional Amounts to Holders of Unsecured Notes on the payment date. Each such Officer’s
Certificate shall be relied upon until receipt of a further Officer’s Certificate addressing such matters.

Whenever in the Unsecured Indenture there is mentioned, in any context:

(1) the payment of principal;

(2) redemption prices or purchase prices in connection with a redemption or purchase of Unsecured Notes;

(3) interest; or

(4) any other amount payable on or with respect to any of the Unsecured Notes,

151


-----

such reference will be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts as described under this heading to the extent that, in such
context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.

The Company will pay any present or future stamp, court or documentary taxes or any other excise or property taxes (other than
net wealth taxes or similar taxes imposed on the Holder irrespective of such Holder’s investment in the Unsecured Notes and based on
the total net value of the Holder’s property), charge or similar levies that arise in any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction from the execution,
delivery, enforcement or registration of the Unsecured Notes, the Unsecured Note Guarantees, the Unsecured Indenture or any other
document or instrument in relation thereto (other than a transfer of the Unsecured Notes).

The obligations described under this heading will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Unsecured Indenture or
any Unsecured Note Guarantee.

**Optional tax redemption**

The Company is entitled to redeem the Unsecured Notes in whole, but not in part, at its option, at any time, upon not less than 30
nor more than 60 days’ notice (which notice shall be irrevocable), at 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid
interest to the date of redemption (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the
relevant interest payment date), in the event the Company or Unsecured Note Guarantor (as the case may be) has become or would
become obligated to pay, on the next date on which any amount would be payable with respect to the Unsecured Notes, Additional
Amounts as a result of:

(1) a change in or an amendment to the laws (including any regulations promulgated thereunder) of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction
affecting taxation; or

(2) any change in or amendment to any official position regarding the application or interpretation of such laws or regulations
(each of (1) and (2) a “Change in Tax Laws”),

which change or amendment becomes effective on or after the date hereof and the Company or Unsecured Note Guarantor (as the
case may be) cannot avoid such obligation by taking reasonable measures available to it.

No such notice of redemption may be given earlier than 90 days prior to the earliest date on which the Company or Unsecured
Note Guarantor (as the case may be) would be obligated to pay such Additional Amounts were a payment in respect of the Unsecured
Notes then due and payable.

Before the Company publishes or mails notice of redemption of the Unsecured Notes as described above, it will deliver to the
Unsecured Notes Trustee (i) an Officer’s Certificate to the effect that the Company or any Unsecured Note Guarantor (as the case may
be) cannot avoid its obligation to pay Additional Amounts by taking reasonable measures available to it and (ii) an opinion in form
and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Unsecured Notes Trustee of independent legal counsel of recognized standing stating that
the Company or Unsecured Note Guarantor (as the case may be) is or would be obligated to pay Additional Amounts as a result of a
Change in Tax Laws. The Unsecured Notes Trustee shall be entitled to accept such Officer’s Certificate and opinion as sufficient
existence of the satisfaction of the conditions precedent described above, in which event it will be conclusive and binding on the
Holders.

The foregoing provisions will apply mutatis mutandis to any successor person to the Company or Unsecured Note Guarantor after
such successor person becomes a party to the Unsecured Indenture.

For so long as the Unsecured Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted for trading on
the Euro MTF Market of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, and to the extent the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require,
the Company will provide a copy of any such notice to the Luxembourg Stock Exchange. Notices of redemption will be given in
accordance with the provisions set forth under “—Selection and notice of redemption.”

**Unsecured Note Guarantees**

**_Overview_**

Certain Subsidiaries of the Company (the “Unsecured Note Guarantors”) will jointly and severally guarantee on a senior basis the
Company’s obligations under the Unsecured Notes and the Unsecured Indenture (the “Unsecured Note Guarantees”). Because of legal
restrictions, not all of the Subsidiaries of the Company will guarantee the Unsecured Notes, and certain of the Unsecured Note
Guarantees will be subject to significant limitations. The aggregate unconsolidated EBITDA for the twelve months ended September
30, 2006 as reported in the respective stand-alone financial statements of such Unsecured Note Guarantors (the calculation of which
differs from the calculation of EBITDA as provided for in the Indenture relating to the Notes) of the Subsidiaries issuing Unsecured
Note Guarantees (after intercompany eliminations) was €114.8 million.

A summary of the Unsecured Note Guarantees and the limits on their enforceability is attached to this listing memorandum as
Annex A, and you are urged to review that appendix in connection with making your investment decision.

**_Unsecured Note Guarantees_**

Each Unsecured Note Guarantor will jointly and severally guarantee, subject to limitations described in Annex A hereto, as a
general unsubordinated obligation, and as a primary obligor and not merely as a surety, the Company’s obligations under the
Unsecured Notes and the Unsecured Indenture. In addition, each Unsecured Note Guarantor will agree to pay any and all costs and
expenses (including counsel fees and expenses) incurred by the Unsecured Notes Trustee or the Holders in enforcing any rights under
the Unsecured Note Guarantees.

The Unsecured Note Guarantee of the Unsecured Notes by each Unsecured Note Guarantor will be a general unsubordinated
obligation of such Unsecured Note Guarantor and:

   - will rank pari passu in right of payment with all its existing and future Debt that is not subordinated to such guarantee;

   - will rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future subordinated obligations of such Unsecured Note Guarantor;
and

   - will be effectively subordinated to any existing and future Debt of such Unsecured Note Guarantor that is secured with assets
of such Unsecured Note Guarantor, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such Debt, including Debt under the
Secured Notes and Indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Facility.

The obligations of each Unsecured Note Guarantor under its Unsecured Note Guarantee will be limited to an amount that can be
guaranteed under applicable laws, including corporate benefit laws and financial assistance, corporate benefit, fraudulent conveyance
or fraudulent transfer restrictions under applicable insolvency laws, and will not apply to the extent a guarantee would be illegal or
unenforceable under applicable local laws. See Annex A hereto and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes” and “Risk Factors—
Risk Factors Related to the Unsecured Notes” elsewhere in this listing memorandum. The Unsecured Note Guarantees will provide
that, in the event of default in the payment of principal of or premium, if any, interest, Additional Amounts, if any, and any other
payment obligations in respect of the Unsecured Notes (including any obligation to repurchase the Unsecured Notes), the Unsecured
Notes Trustee may institute legal proceedings directly against the relevant Unsecured Note Guarantor without first proceeding against
the Company. The Unsecured Notes Trustee (acting of its own volition or on the direction of the Holders of 51% in aggregate
principal amount of the outstanding Unsecured Notes), and not the Holders of the Unsecured Notes individually, may enforce the
Unsecured Note Guarantees.

**_Intercompany Loans_**

Through the Unsecured Notes Proceeds Loans, (i) the Company intends to loan a portion of the net proceeds of the offering of the
Unsecured Notes to Sub Lecta 1 S.A. (a Luxembourg société anonyme), Condat Holding S.A. (a French société anonyme),
Torraspapel Holding S.A., Torraspapel S.A. and Sarriopapel y Celulosa S.A. (each, a Spanish sociedád anónima) and, (ii) in turn, Sub
Lecta 1 S.A. will on-loan a portion of the proceeds to Cartiere del Garda S.p.A., and Condat Holding S.A. will on lend a portion of the
proceeds to Condat S.A.S. Through the Secured Notes Proceeds Loans, the same lenders intend to loan a portion of the net proceeds of

153


-----

the offering of the Secured Notes to the same borrowers. The proceeds of all such intercompany lending will be used to repay existing
indebtedness of certain of the Company’s Subsidiaries and to pay fees and expenses as described under “Use of Proceeds.” Interest
will accrue on the Unsecured Notes Proceeds Loans and the Secured Notes Proceeds Loans at rates at least equal to the interest rates
payable on the Unsecured Notes and the Secured Notes, respectively, with such adjustments as may be necessary to match any
Additional Amounts, premium or default interest due with respect to the Unsecured Notes or the Secured Notes, as the case may be.
The Intercompany Loans provide for repayments of principal in amounts and at times sufficient to enable repayments in full or in part
of principal under the Unsecured Notes or the Secured Notes, as the case may be, whether at maturity, on early redemption or upon
acceleration. Several of the entities issuing Intercompany Loans are holding companies that have no operations and generate no
revenues of their own and have no independent assets other than their investments in their respective Subsidiaries. To the extent such
entities must make payments on the Intercompany Loans, they will be dependent on dividends received from their subsidiaries,
payments on intercompany loans or other distributions.

Each Intercompany Loan will be a general unsubordinated obligation of the Subsidiary borrowing such loan and:

   - will rank pari passu in right of payment with all its existing and future Debt that is not subordinated to such Intercompany
Loan;

   - will rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future subordinated obligations of such Subsidiary; and

   - will be effectively subordinated to any existing and future Debt of such Subsidiary that is secured with property and assets to
the extent of the value of the assets securing such Debt, including all the assets pledged as security for the Revolving Credit
Facility and the Secured Notes.

The Unsecured Notes Proceeds Loans will be pledged by the holders of such loans as collateral to secure obligations under the
Secured Notes and the Revolving Credit Facility. In the event of an enforcement action by any such secured creditors against such
Unsecured Notes Proceeds Loans, or against any share collateral of the borrowers under such intercompany loans, the Unsecured
Notes Proceeds Loans could be released.

**_Release of Unsecured Note Guarantees_**

Pursuant to the Unsecured Indenture, the Capital Stock of an Unsecured Note Guarantor may be sold, leased, transferred or
otherwise disposed of to another Person under the covenant described under “—Certain covenants—Limitation on sales of assets and
Restricted Subsidiary stock.”

Upon any sale or disposition (including, without limitation, by way of merger, consolidation or otherwise) of (i) Capital Stock of
an Unsecured Note Guarantor following which such Unsecured Note Guarantor is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary, (ii) all or
substantially all of the properties and assets of such Unsecured Note Guarantor to a Person that is not (either before or after giving
effect to such transaction) the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company or (iii) all or substantially all of the properties and
assets of such Unsecured Note Guarantor to another Unsecured Note Guarantor in connection with a liquidation or dissolution of such
Unsecured Note Guarantor provided that such other Unsecured Note Guarantor expressly assumes in writing in form satisfactory to
the Unsecured Notes Trustee all the obligations of such Unsecured Note Guarantor under the Unsecured Indenture, as long as the sale
or disposition complies with the covenant described in “—Certain covenants—Limitation on sales of assets and Restricted Subsidiary
stock,” the Unsecured Note Guarantee of any such Restricted Subsidiary will be released.

The Unsecured Note Guarantee provided by an Unsecured Note Guarantor also will be released:

(i) upon the valid designation of such Unsecured Note Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary;

(ii) if the Company exercises its legal defeasance option or covenant defeasance option as described under “—Defeasance” or if
its obligations under the Unsecured Indenture are discharged in accordance with the terms of the Unsecured Indenture, in each
case in accordance with the terms and conditions in the Unsecured Indenture;

(iii) upon repayment in full of the Unsecured Notes;

154


-----

(iv) upon a sale of all the Capital Stock of the applicable Unsecured Note Guarantor (or any parent of such Unsecured Note
Guarantor) pursuant to an Enforcement Action by secured creditors acting under the Intercreditor Agreement; and

(v) in the event that the continued obligations of such Unsecured Note Guarantor or the continued existence of such Unsecured
Note Guarantor could reasonably be expected to give rise to or result in (now or in the future): (a) any violation of applicable
law or (b) any personal liability for the officers, directors or indirect shareholders of such Unsecured Note Guarantor; which in
each case of (a) and (b) cannot be avoided or otherwise prevented through measures reasonably available to the Company and
the Unsecured Note Guarantor.

Upon request and at the cost of the Company, or, as the case may be, the relevant Unsecured Note Guarantor and upon delivery by
the Company to the Unsecured Notes Trustee of an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel to the foregoing effect, the
Unsecured Notes Trustee will execute any documents reasonably requested by the Company or the relevant Unsecured Note
Guarantor, as the case may be, in writing in order to evidence the release, discharge and termination in respect of any Unsecured Note
Guarantee to be released as described above.

The release of guarantees under the Secured Indenture is governed by the provisions of such indenture. See “—Description of the
Secured Notes.”

**Change of Control**

If a Change of Control occurs, the Company will, within 30 days after the occurrence of such Change of Control, notify each
Holder of the Unsecured Notes in accordance with the provisions set forth under “—Notices,” with a copy of such notice to the
Unsecured Notes Trustee in writing, of the occurrence of the Change of Control and will make an offer to purchase (the “Change of
Control Offer”) the Unsecured Notes, in whole or in part, in principal amounts of €50,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 above
€50,000 at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the Change
of Control Purchase Date (such price, together with such interest, the “Change of Control Purchase Price”), on or before the date
specified in such notice, which date (the “Change of Control Purchase Date”) shall be no earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days
from the date such notice is mailed, or such later date as may be required by law or any applicable requirements of any securities
exchange on which such Unsecured Notes are listed. The Change of Control Offer is required to remain open for at least 20 Business
Days and until the close of business on the Change of Control Purchase Date. The Company will purchase all Unsecured Notes
properly tendered in the Change of Control Offer and not withdrawn in accordance with the procedures set forth in such notice. The
Change of Control Offer will state, among other things, the procedures that Holders of the Unsecured Notes must follow to accept the
Change of Control Offer.

The Secured Indenture and the Revolving Credit Facility will have similar provisions requiring the Company and/or borrowers
under such instruments to offer to repay such instruments. No assurance can be given that the Company will have sufficient liquidity
to comply with such provisions and to make the Change of Control Offers required by the Unsecured Notes Indenture and the Secured
Notes Indenture.

The Company will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control if a third party makes the
Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Unsecured
Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Company and purchases all Unsecured Notes validly tendered and not
withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer.

The occurrence of certain of the events which would constitute a Change of Control would require mandatory prepayment of Debt
outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility and might constitute a default under, or require prepayment of, future Debt of the
Company or its Subsidiaries. The occurrence of a Change of Control would also trigger an obligation of the Company to repurchase
the Secured Notes, which may in turn lead to a default under the Secured Notes if the Company cannot finance such a repurchase. In
addition, the exercise by the Holders of the Unsecured Notes of their right to require the Company to repurchase the Unsecured Notes
could cause a default under the Debt of the Company or its Subsidiaries, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the
financial effect of such repurchase on the Company. Finally, if a Change of Control Offer is made, there can be no assurance that the
Company will have sufficient funds or other resources to pay the Change of Control Purchase Price for all the Unsecured Notes that
might be delivered by Holders thereof seeking to accept the Change of Control Offer. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the
Notes— We may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance a Change of Control Offer if required by the terms and

155


-----

conditions of the Notes” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes—Our significant leverage may make it difficult for us to
service our debt, including the Notes, and to operate our business.”

The Change of Control provisions described above may deter certain mergers, tender offers and other takeover attempts involving
the Company and, thus, the removal of incumbent management. One of the events that constitutes a Change of Control under the
Unsecured Indenture is a sale, conveyance, transfer or lease of all or substantially all the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole. The phrase “all or substantially all” is subject to judicial interpretation depending on the facts and circumstances of
the subject transaction. The Unsecured Indenture will be governed by New York law, and there is no established quantitative
definition under New York law of “substantially all” the assets of a corporation. Accordingly, in certain circumstances it may be
unclear whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether the Company may therefore be required to make a Change of Control
Offer.

If at the time of such Change of Control, the Unsecured Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange
and admitted for trading on the Euro MTF Market of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, to the extent required by the rules of the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange, the Company will notify the Luxembourg Stock Exchange that a Change of Control has occurred and
any relevant details relating to such Change of Control.

The Company will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the U.S. Exchange Act and any
other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Unsecured Notes pursuant to any Change of Control Offer.
To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions relating to the Change of Control Offer,
the Company will comply with applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations
under the Change of Control covenant by virtue thereof.

**Certain covenants**

The Unsecured Indenture contains, among others, the following covenants:

**_Limitation on Debt_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, Incur any Debt (including Acquired
Debt) other than Permitted Debt; provided however, that the Company may, and may permit any Unsecured Note Guarantor to, Incur
Debt if (i) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of such Incurrence or would occur as a
consequence of such Incurrence and (ii) after giving Pro forma effect to such Incurrence, the Consolidated Coverage Ratio as of the
date of the Incurrence of such Debt would exceed 2.50 to 1.00.

Permitted Debt is defined as follows:

(i) Debt (a) of the Issuer evidenced by the Unsecured Notes issued on the Issue Date (not including Additional Unsecured Notes),
(b) of the Unsecured Note Guarantors in respect of the Unsecured Note Guarantees, including any Additional Unsecured Note
Guarantees, (c) of the Issuer evidenced by the Secured Notes (not including Additional Secured Notes), (d) of the Secured Note
Guarantors in respect of the Secured Note Guarantees, including any Additional Secured Note Guarantees (but only to the
extent such Additional Secured Note Guarantees are given by a Subsidiary that also provides an Additional Secured Note
Guarantee), and (e) any “parallel debt” obligations created under the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Documents or the
Secured Indenture in respect of clauses (c) and (d);

(ii) Debt of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary (x) Incurred under the Revolving Credit Facility (including, without double
counting, any Debt to the extent backed by letters of credit, guarantees or bonds issued under the Revolving Credit Facility),
and (y) any Refinancing Debt and any “parallel debt” obligations created under the Intercreditor Agreement or the Security
Documents Incurred in respect of Debt under (x), _provided, that the aggregate principal amount of all such Debt under the_
Revolving Credit Facility and any Refinancing Debt in respect thereof under this clause (ii) at any one time outstanding does
not exceed €75 million, which amount shall be permanently reduced by any payments made by the Company under the
Revolving Credit Facility with the Net Available Cash from any Asset Disposition (which are accompanied by a
corresponding permanent commitment reduction) pursuant to clause (iii) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under
“—Limitation on sales of assets and Restricted Subsidiary stock.”

156


-----

(iii) (intentionally omitted)

(iv) Debt Incurred by the Subsidiary which owns and operates (or will operate) the Riva del Garda cogeneration facility in an
amount not to exceed €55 million, provided such Debt is used for the purpose of investing in the Riva del Garda cogeneration
facility and provided, further, (A) that such Debt is not secured by assets of the Company or any other Restricted Subsidiary
(other than shares of the Subsidiary which owns and operates (or will operate) such facility and its assets) and neither the
Company nor any Restricted Subsidiary guarantees such Debt in any way, directly or indirectly, or provides any “keep well”
or guarantees of the net worth of such Subsidiary, and (B) such Subsidiary does not own any Capital Stock, Redeemable
Stock or Debt of, or own or hold any Lien on any property or assets of, the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(v) Debt of the Company owing to and held by any Restricted Subsidiary and Debt of any Restricted Subsidiary owing to and held
by the Company or any wholly-owned Restricted Subsidiary; provided, however, that if such Debt is owed by the Company or
an Unsecured Note Guarantor (other than an Intercompany Loan), then it shall be expressly subordinated to the prior payment
in full in cash of all obligations with respect to the Unsecured Notes; and provided, further, that any subsequent transfer of any
such Debt (except to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary), shall be deemed, in each case, to constitute the Incurrence of
such Debt by the issuer thereof;

(vi) Debt (other than Debt permitted by the immediately preceding paragraph or elsewhere in this paragraph) in an aggregate
principal amount outstanding at any time not to exceed €50 million;

(vii) the incurrence by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of Debt represented by Capitalized Lease Obligations,
mortgage financings or purchase money obligations, in each case, Incurred for the purpose of financing or refinancing all or
any part of the purchase price or cost of construction or improvement of property, plant or equipment used in the business of
the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, or in respect of a sale and leaseback transaction, in an aggregate principal
amount, not to exceed €5 million at any time outstanding;

(viii) Debt Incurred pursuant to any Qualified Receivables Financing that is not recourse to the Company or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries except for such recourse as arises through Standard Securitization Undertakings;

(ix) Debt under Hedging Obligations that are Incurred in the ordinary course of business, not for speculative purposes and (1) for
the purpose of fixing or hedging interest rate risk with respect to any Debt Incurred without violation of the Unsecured
Indenture; (2) for the purpose of fixing or hedging currency exchange rate risk with respect to any currency; or (3) for the
purpose of fixing or hedging commodity price risk with respect to any commodities;

(x) Debt in connection with one or more standby letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or performance, bid, surety, judgment,
appeal or similar bonds or completion guarantees provided by the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary and issued in the
ordinary course of business or pursuant to self-insurance obligations and not in connection with the borrowing of money or the
obtaining of advances of credit;

(xi) Debt arising from the honoring by a bank or other financial institution of a check, draft or similar instrument drawn against
insufficient funds, overdrafts or cash pooling arrangements in the ordinary course of business; provided, however, that any
such Debt that arises is extinguished within six Business Days of Incurrence;

(xii) Debt of the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries represented by letters of credit for the account of the Company or
such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, in order to provide security for workers’ compensation claims, payment
obligations in connection with self-insurance or similar requirements in the ordinary course of business;

(xiii) Debt arising from agreements of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary providing for indemnification, adjustment of
purchase price, earn out or similar obligations, in each case, Incurred in connection with the disposition of any business,
assets or Subsidiary, other than guarantees of Debt Incurred by any Person acquiring all or any portion of such business,
assets or Subsidiary for the purpose of financing such acquisition; provided that the maximum aggregate liability in respect
of all such Debt shall at no time exceed the gross proceeds actually received by the Company and the Restricted Subsidiary
in connection with such disposition;

157


-----

(xiv) guarantees by the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary of Debt Incurred by the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary so long
as the Incurrence of such Debt by the Company or any such Restricted Subsidiary is otherwise permitted by the terms of the
Unsecured Indenture;

(xv) guarantees by the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary of Debt Incurred by Joint Ventures that does not exceed €5 million in
the aggregate at any one time outstanding;

(xvi) Debt of a Person existing at the time that Person becomes a Restricted Subsidiary or assumed in connection with an Asset
Acquisition by the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary and not Incurred in connection with or in anticipation of, such Person
becoming a Restricted Subsidiary; _provided that the holders of any such Debt do not, at any time, have direct or indirect_
recourse to any property or assets of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary other than the property or assets of such
acquired Person; provided, further, that on the date of such acquisition and after giving Pro forma effect thereto, either (1)
the Company would have been able to Incur at least €1.00 of additional Debt pursuant to the immediately preceding
paragraph or (2) the Consolidated Coverage Ratio would be greater than or equal to the Consolidated Coverage Ratio
immediately prior to giving Pro forma effect to such acquisition;

(xvii) Debt of the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries Incurred pursuant to an obligation imposed by law to transfer
employee benefit obligation to a third party;

(xviii) Debt pursuant to the reclassification of any provision reflecting obligations under the put-call arrangement with Grupo
Torras in relation to shares in Torraspapel S.A. that arise as a result of a change to IFRS or as a result of the exercise of any
put or call pursuant to such put-call arrangement;

(xix) Debt of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary not otherwise described in clauses (i) through (xviii) above (1)
outstanding on the Issue Date and disclosed in the Offering Memorandum and (2) any Refinancing Debt Incurred in respect
thereof; and

(xx) Refinancing Debt Incurred in respect of Debt Incurred under the first paragraph of this covenant or under clause (i) or (xvi)
hereof;

_provided, however, that, for purposes of determining the compliance of any non-euro-denominated Debt Incurred under clauses (ii),_
(iv), (vi), (vii), (xv) or (xvi) above with the euro-denominated restriction contained therein, the euro-equivalent principal amount of
such Debt Incurred pursuant thereto will be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Debt
was Incurred, in the case of term Debt, or first committed, in the case of revolving credit Debt; provided, that (i) the euro-equivalent
principal amount of any such Debt outstanding on the Issue Date under clause (ii) above (other than term Debt) will be calculated
based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date thereof and (iii) (A) any Refinancing Debt Incurred to refinance
non-euro-denominated Debt previously Incurred which would cause the euro-denominated restriction under such clause to be
exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing (the “Initial Refinancing Rate”)
will be deemed not to exceed such euro-denominated restriction under such clause so long as the principal amount of such
Refinancing Debt does not exceed the principal amount of the Debt being refinanced, and (B) all subsequent Incurrences of
Refinancing Debt subject to the euro-denominated restriction under such clause will be determined as if the relevant currency
exchange rate applied to any subsequent Refinancing Debt was the Initial Refinancing Rate; _provided, however, that the principal_
amount of any such subsequent Refinancing Debt, if Incurred in a currency other than the currency of the Debt being refinanced, will
be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currency or currencies in which such proposed Refinancing Debt
is denominated on the date of such refinancing.

For purposes of determining any particular amount of Debt under this “Limitation on Debt” covenant, accrual of interest, accrual
of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the obligation to pay commitment fees and the payment of interest in the form of
additional Debt shall not be treated as Debt. In addition, for purposes of determining compliance with this “Limitation on Debt”
covenant, in the event that an item of proposed Debt meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of Permitted Debt described
in clauses (i) through (xviii) above, or is entitled to be Incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant, the Company shall be
permitted to classify such item of Debt on the date of its Incurrence and, except with respect to Debt Incurred under clause (ii) above,
reclassify such item of Debt, in each case in any manner that complies with this covenant.

158


-----

**_Limitation on Restricted Payments_**

The Company will not make, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to make, directly or indirectly, any Restricted Payment
if at the time of, and after giving effect to, such proposed Restricted Payment,

(a) a Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing,

(b) the Company could not Incur at least €1.00 of additional Debt pursuant to the first paragraph of the covenant described under
“—Limitation on Debt,” or

(c) the aggregate amount of such Restricted Payment and all other Restricted Payments declared or made since the Issue Date (the
amount of any Restricted Payment, if made other than in cash, to be based upon Fair Market Value) would exceed an amount
equal to the sum of:

(i) 50% of the aggregate Consolidated Net Income accrued during the period (treated as one accounting period) from the Issue
Date, to the end of the Company’s most recent fiscal quarter ending prior to the date of such proposed Restricted Payment (or if
Consolidated Net Income shall be a deficit, minus 100% of such deficit),

(ii) Capital Stock Sale Proceeds and (without duplication of any amounts included in Capital Stock Sale Proceeds) Capital Stock
Contributions, and

(iii) the amount by which Debt of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary is reduced on the Company’s balance sheet upon the
conversion or exchange (other than by a Subsidiary) subsequent to the Issue Date of any Debt of the Company or any
Restricted Subsidiary convertible or exchangeable for Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock) of the Company (less the
amount of any cash or other property distributed by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary upon such conversion or
exchange).

Notwithstanding the foregoing limitation, the Company and any Restricted Subsidiary may:

(a) pay dividends on its Capital Stock within 60 days of the declaration thereof if, on said declaration date, such dividends could
have been paid in compliance with the Unsecured Indenture; provided, however, that such dividend shall be included in the
calculation of the amount of Restricted Payments;

(b) redeem, repurchase, defease, acquire or retire for value, any Subordinated Obligation with the proceeds of any Refinancing
Debt in respect of such Subordinated Obligation; _provided, however_ that such redemption, repurchase, defeasance or other
acquisition or retirement for value shall be excluded in the calculation of the amount of Restricted Payments;

(c) make any Restricted Payment by exchange for, or out of the proceeds of the substantially concurrent sale of, Capital Stock of
the Company (other than Disqualified Stock and other than Capital Stock issued or sold to a Subsidiary of the Company or an
employee stock ownership plan or to a trust established by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for the benefit of their
employees) or Capital Stock Contributions; _provided, however, that (i) such Restricted Payment shall be excluded in the_
calculation of the amount of Restricted Payments and (ii) the Net Cash Proceeds from such sale or contribution shall, to the
extent so used to acquire, redeem or retire Capital Stock of the Company or Subordinated Obligations of the Company, be
excluded from the calculation of the amount of Capital Stock Sale Proceeds and Capital Stock Contributions;

(d) make cash payments in lieu of issuing fractional shares pursuant to the exercise or conversion of any exercisable or convertible
securities;

(e) make payments or distributions to dissenting shareholders pursuant to applicable law in connection with or in contemplation of
a merger, consolidation or transfer of assets that complies with the covenant described under “—Certain covenants—
Consolidation, merger and sale of assets;”

159


-----

(f) make payments of dividends on Disqualified Stock issued in accordance with the covenant described under “—Limitation on
Debt;” and

(g) make additional Restricted Payments in an aggregate amount not to exceed €5 million since the Issue Date.

**_Transactions with Affiliates_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, enter into any transaction or series
of related transactions (including the purchase, sale, transfer, assignment, lease, conveyance or exchange of any property or the
rendering of any service) with, or for the benefit of, any Affiliate of the Company (an “Affiliate Transaction”) unless (a) the terms of
such Affiliate Transaction are no less favorable to the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that
could be obtained in a comparable arm’s length transaction with a Person that is not an Affiliate of the Company or such Restricted
Subsidiary, (b) with respect to an Affiliate Transaction involving aggregate payments or value in excess of €5 million, the terms of
such Affiliate Transaction are set forth in writing and the Board of Directors (including a majority of the disinterested members of the
Board of Directors) approves such Affiliate Transaction and, in its good faith judgment, believes that such Affiliate Transaction
complies with clause (a) of this paragraph and (c) with respect to an Affiliate Transaction involving aggregate payments or value in
excess of €20 million, the terms of such Affiliate Transaction are set forth in writing and the Company obtains a written opinion from
an Independent Appraiser to the effect that such Affiliate Transaction is fair, from a financial point of view, to the Company or is not
less favorable to the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary than could have been obtained in a comparable arms’ length transaction
with a Person that is not an Affiliate of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary.

The foregoing covenant will not prohibit: (A) Permitted Investments and any Restricted Payment permitted to be paid as described
above under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments,” (B) any issuance of securities, or other payments, awards or grants in cash,
securities or otherwise pursuant to, or the funding of or other transactions pursuant to, employment arrangements, stock options and
stock ownership plans approved by the Board of Directors of the Company, (C) loans or advances to employees of the Company in the
ordinary course of business, (D) the payment of reasonable fees, compensation and employee benefit arrangements, customary
insurance and indemnities to directors, officers, managers, employees or consultants of the Company and of Restricted Subsidiaries,
(E) any transaction between the Company and a Restricted Subsidiary or between Restricted Subsidiaries, (F) the performance of any
agreement as in effect on the Issue Date which is disclosed to Holders of the Unsecured Notes in the Offering Memorandum under the
heading “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions” or any amendment or renewal thereto or any transaction contemplated
thereby or in any replacement agreement thereto so long as any such amendment or renewal or replacement agreement is not more
disadvantageous to the Holders of Unsecured Notes (as determined by the Board of Directors of the Company in their reasonable and
good faith judgment) in any material respect than the original agreement, (G) transactions between or among any of the Company, any
of its Subsidiaries and any Person in connection with a Qualified Receivables Financing, in each case provided that such transactions
are not otherwise prohibited by the Unsecured Indenture, (H) transactions between the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries
and any Person that is an Affiliate solely as a result of the ownership by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of Capital
Stock of such Person, (I) transactions with customers, clients, suppliers or purchasers or sellers of goods or services, in each case in
the ordinary course of business and otherwise in compliance with the terms of the Unsecured Indenture which are fair to the Company
or its Restricted Subsidiaries, or are on terms at least as favorable as might reasonably have been obtained at such time from an
unaffiliated party, in each case in the reasonable determination of the Board of Directors of the Company or the senior management
thereof or (J) payments by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, directly or indirectly, to CVC Capital Partners Limited
and its Affiliates made for any financial advisory, financing, underwriting, management or placement services or in respect of other
investment banking activities, including in connection with acquisitions or divestitures, which payments are reasonably related to the
services performed and customary for the nature of the services performed and approved by the Board of Directors of the Company in
good faith.

**_Limitation on Liens_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, Incur Secured Debt of any kind (other than Secured Debt
secured by a Permitted Lien) unless contemporaneously therewith, effective provision is also made that:

(1) in the case of Secured Debt that is expressly subordinate or junior in right of payment to the Unsecured Notes or an Unsecured
Note Guarantee, the Unsecured Notes or such Unsecured Note Guarantee, as the case may be, are secured prior to such
Secured Debt for so long as such Secured Debt is secured by a Lien; and

160


-----

(2) in all other cases, the Unsecured Notes or the Unsecured Note Guarantee of such Unsecured Note Guarantor, as the case may
be, is secured equally and ratably to such Secured Debt for so long as such Secured Debt is secured by a Lien.

**_Limitation on guarantees of Debt by Restricted Subsidiaries_**

The Company will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary that is not an Unsecured Note Guarantor, directly or indirectly, to
guarantee, assume or in any other manner become liable for the payment of any Debt of the Company or an Unsecured Note
Guarantor under any Debt unless:

(1) (A) such Restricted Subsidiary simultaneously executes and delivers a supplemental indenture providing for an Unsecured
Note Guarantee of payment of the Unsecured Notes by such Restricted Subsidiary on the same terms as the guarantee of such
Debt; and

(B) with respect to any guarantee of Subordinated Obligations by such Restricted Subsidiary, any such guarantee will be
subordinated to such Restricted Subsidiary’s Unsecured Note Guarantee at least to the same extent as such Subordinated
Obligations are subordinated to the Unsecured Notes; and

(2) such Restricted Subsidiary waives and will not in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any rights
of reimbursement, indemnity or subrogation or any other rights against the Company or any other Restricted Subsidiary as a
result of any payment by such Restricted Subsidiary under its Unsecured Note Guarantee.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be obligated to cause any such Restricted Subsidiary to guarantee the
Unsecured Notes to the extent that such Unsecured Note Guarantee would reasonably be expected to give rise to or result in (i) any
violation of applicable law, rule, regulation or order that cannot be avoided or otherwise prevented through measures reasonably
available to the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary or (ii) any liability for the officers, directors or shareholders of such Restricted
Subsidiary.

In addition, notwithstanding the foregoing and the other provisions of the Unsecured Indenture, any Unsecured Note Guarantee
issued pursuant to this covenant by a Restricted Subsidiary shall provide by its terms that it shall be automatically and unconditionally
released and discharged in the circumstances described under “Unsecured Note Guarantees—Release of Unsecured Note Guarantees.”

**_Limitation on restrictions on distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, create or otherwise cause or permit
to exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to (a) pay dividends
or make any other distributions on its Capital Stock, (b) make any loans or advances to the Company or any other Restricted
Subsidiary or (c) transfer any of its property or assets to the Company or any other Restricted Subsidiary, except:

(i) any encumbrance or restriction which is in effect at or entered into on the Issue Date, including pursuant to the Revolving
Credit Facility, and which is (a) disclosed in the Offering Memorandum under the heading “Description of Indebtedness” or
“Description of the Secured Notes,” or the Secured Indenture or (b) in respect of Debt permitted under clause (iv) of the second
paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Debt,” provided the encumbrance or restriction applies only to the
Subsidiary which owns the Riva del Garda co-generation facility and the conditions of clause (B) of such clause (iv) are
satisfied;

(ii) any encumbrance or restriction with respect to a Restricted Subsidiary or property or assets pursuant to an agreement on or
prior to the date on which such Restricted Subsidiary or property or assets was acquired by the Company or a Restricted
Subsidiary (other than Debt Incurred as consideration in, or to provide all or any portion of the funds or credit support utilized
to consummate, the transaction or series of related transactions pursuant to which such Restricted Subsidiary became a
Restricted Subsidiary or was acquired by the Company or Restricted Subsidiary or the property or assets were acquired by the
Company or Restricted Subsidiary) and outstanding on such date;

161


-----

(iii) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement effecting an amendment, modification, restatement, renewal,
increase, supplement, refund, replacement or refinancing of an agreement referred to in clauses (i) or (ii) of this covenant or
this clause (iii); provided, however, that the encumbrances and restrictions contained in any such agreement or amendment,
taken as a whole, are no less favorable to the Holders of the Unsecured Notes than encumbrances and restrictions contained in
such predecessor agreements;

(iv) any encumbrance or restriction (A) consisting of customary provisions restricting subletting or assignment of leases and
customary provisions in other agreements that restrict assignment of such agreements or rights thereunder or customary
restrictions contained in asset sale agreements limiting the transfer of such property pending the closing of such sale, (B)
arising by virtue of any transfer of, agreement to transfer, option or right with respect to, or Lien on, any property or assets of
the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary not otherwise prohibited by the terms of the Unsecured Indenture or (C) arising or
agreed to in the ordinary course of business and that does not, individually or in the aggregate, detract from the value of
property or assets of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in any manner material to the Company
and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole;

(v) in the case of clause (c) above, restrictions contained in Capitalized Lease Obligations, security agreements or mortgages
securing Debt of a Restricted Subsidiary to the extent such restrictions restrict the transfer of the property subject to such
Capitalized Lease Obligations, security agreements or mortgages;

(vi) any restriction with respect to a Restricted Subsidiary imposed pursuant to an agreement entered into for the sale or
disposition of all or substantially all the Capital Stock or assets of such Restricted Subsidiary pending the closing of such sale
or disposition;

(vii) any encumbrance or restriction with respect to a Restricted Subsidiary imposed pursuant to a Permitted Joint Venture
Transaction;

(viii) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement related to Debt in respect of any Qualified Receivables Financing
which is permitted under clause (viii) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “— Limitation on Debt;”

(ix) any encumbrance or restriction imposed pursuant to any Interest Rate Protection Agreement, Currency Exchange Protection
Agreement or Commodity Agreement;

(x) any encumbrance or restriction imposed by applicable law, rules, regulations and/or orders;

(xi) any encumbrances or restrictions on cash or other deposits or net worth imposed by customers under contracts entered into in
the ordinary course of business; and

(xii) any encumbrances or restrictions Incurred in accordance with the covenant described under “—Limitation on Liens.”

**_Limitation on sales of assets and Restricted Subsidiary stock_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, make any Asset Disposition unless:

(i) the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, receives consideration at the time of such Asset Disposition at
least equal to the Fair Market Value of the assets subject to such Asset Disposition;

(ii) at least 75% of such consideration consists of cash or Cash Equivalents, and is received at the time of the Asset Disposition
(which shall be deemed to include other consideration converted to cash or Cash Equivalents within 90 days of such Asset
Disposition); and

(iii) an amount equal to 100% of the Net Available Cash from such Asset Disposition is applied by the Company or such
Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be:

162


-----

(A) _first, to the extent the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary elects, to make an investment in, or expenditures for, properties_
and assets (including by means of an investment in Additional Assets by a Restricted Subsidiary with Net Available Cash
received by the Company or another Restricted Subsidiary) within twelve months from the later of such Asset Disposition or
the receipt of such Net Available Cash or pursuant to arrangements in place within the twelve-month period (to the extent
such arrangements are completed within 180 days after execution of such arrangement);

(B) _second, to the extent of the balance of such Net Available Cash after application in accordance with clause (A), to the extent_
the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary elects (or is required by the terms of Debt), to prepay, repay or purchase Senior
Debt of the Company or any Unsecured Note Guarantor or Debt of a Subsidiary of the Company that is not an Unsecured
Note Guarantor (in each case other than Debt owed to the Company or an Affiliate of the Company) within twelve-months
from the later of the date of such Asset Disposition or the receipt of such Net Available Cash;

(C) _third, to the extent of the balance of such Net Available Cash after application in accordance with clauses (A) and (B), to the_
extent the Company elects, to purchase Unsecured Notes;

(D) _fourth, to the extent of the balance of such Net Available Cash after application in accordance with clauses (A), (B) and (C), to_
make a Prepayment Offer (as defined below) to purchase Unsecured Notes pursuant to and subject to the conditions described
below; and

(E) _fifth, to the extent of the balance of such Net Available Cash after application in accordance with clauses (A), (B), (C), or (D),_
for any purpose permitted by the Unsecured Indenture;

_provided, however, that, in connection with any prepayment, repayment or purchase of Debt pursuant to clause (B), (C) or (D), the_
Company or such Restricted Subsidiary will retire such Debt and will cause the related loan commitment (if any) to be
permanently reduced in an amount equal to the principal amount so prepaid, repaid or purchased.

Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries will not be required to apply any Net
Available Cash in accordance with such foregoing provisions to the extent that such Net Available Cash does not exceed €10 million
during any fiscal year, except to the extent that the aggregate Net Available Cash from all Asset Dispositions which are not applied in
accordance with the foregoing provisions exceeds €20 million. Pending application of Net Available Cash pursuant to this provision,
such Net Available Cash may be used to temporarily reduce revolving credit borrowings or otherwise invested in any manner that is
not prohibited by the terms of the Unsecured Indenture.

In the event of any Asset Disposition that requires the purchase of Unsecured Notes pursuant to clause (D), the Company will be
required to purchase Unsecured Notes tendered pursuant to any offer by the Company for Unsecured Notes (the “Prepayment Offer”)
at a purchase price of 100% of their principal amount plus accrued interest (if any) to the Purchase Date (as defined below) in
accordance with the procedures (including prorating the Unsecured Notes and Secured Notes in the event of oversubscription on the
basis of the aggregate amount of each series of Notes tendered) set forth in the Unsecured Indenture. The Company will not be
required to make a Prepayment Offer for Unsecured Notes if the Net Available Cash available therefor (after application of the
proceeds as provided in clauses (A), (B) and (C)) is less than €10 million for any particular Asset Disposition (which lesser amounts
will be carried forward for purposes of determining whether a Prepayment Offer is required with respect to the Net Available Cash
from any subsequent Asset Disposition).

Promptly, and in any event within ten days after the Company becomes obligated to make a Prepayment Offer, the Company will
deliver to the Unsecured Notes Trustee and to each Holder of Unsecured Notes in accordance with the provisions set forth under “—
Notices” a written notice stating that such Holder may elect to have its Unsecured Notes purchased by the Company, either in whole
or in part (subject to prorating in the event the Prepayment Offer is oversubscribed) and in principal amounts of €50,000 and integral
multiples of €1,000 above €50,000 at the applicable purchase price. The notice will specify a purchase date not less than 30 days nor
more than 60 days after the date of such notice (the “Purchase Date”) and will contain information concerning the business of the
Company which the Company in good faith believes will enable Holders of Unsecured Notes to make an informed decision and will
contain all instructions and material necessary to tender Unsecured Notes pursuant to the Prepayment Offer and the procedures for
withdrawing such a tender (such procedures as set forth in the Unsecured Indenture). After consummation of any Prepayment Offer,
Net Available Cash shall be reset to zero.

163


-----

The Company will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the U.S. Exchange Act and any
other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Unsecured Notes as described above. To the extent that the
provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions relating to the Prepayment Offer, the Company will comply
with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations described above by virtue
thereof.

For the purposes of this covenant, the following will be deemed to be cash: (1) the assumption by the transferee of Debt (other than
Subordinated Obligations) of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary and the release of the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary
from all liability on such Debt in connection with such Asset Disposition (in which case the Company shall, without further action, be
deemed to have applied such assumed Debt in accordance with clause (iii) of the first paragraph of this covenant); and (2) (a) Capital
Stock of a Person conducting a Related Business that as a result of such acquisition becomes a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company
and (b) any other property or assets (other than Debt and Capital Stock) that are used or useful in a Related Business.

**_Monitoring by Unsecured Notes Trustee_**

The Unsecured Notes Trustee shall have no responsibility for monitoring any of the covenants described in this section “Certain
covenants” and shall be entitled to assume, unless it receives written notice to the contrary, that the Company and any Restricted
Subsidiaries are all complying with their covenant obligations described herein. The Company shall, pursuant to the Unsecured
Indenture, provide to the Unsecured Notes Trustee a certificate of compliance on an annual basis certifying compliance (or not, as
applicable) with such covenants, and the Unsecured Notes Trustee will be entitled to rely on such certificates absolutely and without
further enquiry.

**_Reports to Holders_**

For so long as any Unsecured Notes are outstanding, the Company will provide to the Unsecured Notes Trustee the following
reports:

(a) within 120 days after the end of the Company’s fiscal year, annual reports, in a level of detail that is comparable in all material
respects to that included in the Offering Memorandum (with appropriate revisions, as reasonably determined by the Company,
to reflect changes in segment reporting, and except that the Company shall not be required to commission expert reports as part
of any description of the industry), containing, to the extent applicable, the following information: (i) audited consolidated
balance sheets of the Company as of the end of the two most recent fiscal years and audited consolidated income statements
and statements of cash flow of the Company for the three most recent fiscal years, including complete footnotes to such
financial statements and the report of the independent auditors on the financial statements; (ii) Pro forma income statement and
balance sheet information of the Company, which need not comply with Article 11 of Regulation S-X under the U.S. Exchange
Act (“Regulation S-X”), together with explanatory footnotes, for any material acquisitions, dispositions or recapitalizations
that have occurred since the beginning of the most recently completed fiscal year unless _Pro forma information has been_
provided in a previous report pursuant to clause (b)(ii) or (b)(iii) below (and _provided_ that an acquisition, disposition or
recapitalization that has occurred less than 75 calendar days prior to the date such report is to be provided, such acquisition,
disposition or recapitalization shall be included in the report for the next fiscal quarter); (iii) an operating and financial review
of the audited financial statements, including a discussion of the results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity and
capital resources of the Company, and a discussion of material commitments and contingencies and critical accounting
policies; (iv) a description of the business, management and shareholders of the Company, all material affiliate transactions
and a description of all material contractual arrangements, including material debt instruments; (v) a description of material
risk factors and material recent developments; (vi) earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization; (vii) capital
expenditures; (viii) depreciation and amortization; and (ix) operating profit (loss) in IFRS;

(b) within 60 days following the end of the first three fiscal quarters in each fiscal year of the Company, all quarterly financial
statements of the Company containing the following information: (i) an unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet as of
the end of such quarter and unaudited condensed statements of income and cash flow for the most recent quarter and year-todate periods ending on the unaudited condensed balance sheet date, and the comparable prior year period, together with
condensed footnote disclosure; (ii) Pro forma income statement and balance sheet information of the Company (which need
not comply with Article 11 of Regulation S-X), together with explanatory footnotes, for any material acquisitions, dispositions
or recapitalizations that have occurred since the beginning of the most recently completed fiscal year unless _Pro forma_

164


-----

information has been provided in a previous report pursuant to clause (b)(i) or (b)(iii) (and _provided_ that an acquisition,
disposition or recapitalization that has occurred less than 75 calendar days prior to the date such report is to be provided, such
acquisition, disposition or recapitalization shall be included in the report for the next fiscal quarter or the current fiscal year,
whichever occurs first); (iii) an operating and financial review of the unaudited financial statements, including a discussion of
the results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity and capital resources of the Company, and a discussion of material
commitments and contingencies and critical accounting polices; and (iv) material recent developments and any material
changes to the risk factors disclosed in the most recent annual report; and

(c) promptly after the occurrence of any material acquisition, disposition or restructuring of the Company and its Restricted
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or any senior executive officer changes at the Company or change in auditors of the Company
or any other material event that the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries announces publicly, a report containing a
description of such event.

At any time that any of the Company’s Subsidiaries are Unrestricted Subsidiaries, then the quarterly and annual financial
information required by (a) and (b) above will include a reasonably detailed presentation, either on the face of the financial statements
or in the footnotes thereto, of the financial condition and results of operations of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries separate
from the financial condition and results of operations of the Unrestricted Subsidiaries.

All the financial statements and Pro forma financial information shall be prepared in accordance with IFRS on a consistent basis
for the periods presented. Except as provided for above, no report need include separate financial statements or information for the
Company or Subsidiaries of the Company or any disclosure with respect to the results of operations or any other financial or statistical
disclosure not of a type included in the Offering Memorandum.

For purposes of this covenant, an acquisition or disposition shall be deemed “material” if the business acquired or disposed of
would constitute a “significant subsidiary,” as provided in Rule 1-02(w) of Regulation S-X, substituting 20% for 10% in the tests
therein.

Contemporaneously with the furnishing of each such report discussed above, the Company will also post such report on the
Company’s website or otherwise provide substantially comparable public availability of such report. In the event that the Company
becomes subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the U.S. Exchange Act, or elects to comply with such
provisions, the Company will, for so long as it continues to file the reports required by Section 13(a) with the SEC, make available to
the Unsecured Notes Trustee the annual reports, information, documents and other reports that the Company is required to file with
the SEC pursuant to such Section 13(a) or 15(d). Upon complying with the foregoing requirement, the Company will be deemed to
have complied with the provisions contained in the preceding three paragraphs.

The Unsecured Indenture also provides that, so long as any of the Unsecured Notes remain “restricted securities” within the
meaning of Rule 501 under the U.S. Securities Act and during any period during which the Company is not subject to Section 13 or
15(d) of the U.S. Exchange Act nor exempt therefrom pursuant to Rule 12g3-2(b), the Company will make available to any
prospective purchaser of the Unsecured Notes or beneficial owner of Unsecured Notes in connection with any sale thereof the
information required by Rule 144A(d)(4) under the U.S. Securities Act. The Company will also make any of the foregoing
information available during normal business hours at the offices of the listing agent in Luxembourg if and so long as the Unsecured
Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the rules of that exchange so require.

**_Limitation on lines of business_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, engage in any business other than a Related
Business or other than in connection with a Permitted Receivables Financing.

**_Consolidation, merger and sale of assets_**

The Company will not merge or consolidate with or into any other entity (other than a merger or consolidation of a Restricted
Subsidiary into the Company, or the Company into a Restricted Subsidiary (except that such merger or consolidation shall comply
with clauses (b) and (e) below) or sell, transfer, assign, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its property or
assets in any one transaction or series of transactions unless the following requirements are satisfied:

165


-----

(a) the Company shall be the surviving Person or the surviving Person (if other than the Company), formed by such consolidation
or merger or the Person to which such sale, transfer, assignment, lease, conveyance or disposition is made shall be a
corporation organized and existing under the laws of the United States of America or a State thereof or the District of
Columbia or any European Union Member State (any such Person, the “Surviving Person”);

(b) the Surviving Person (if other than the Company) expressly assumes, by supplemental indenture in form satisfactory to the
Unsecured Notes Trustee, executed and delivered to the Unsecured Notes Trustee by such Surviving Person, all the obligations
of the Company, including the due and punctual performance and observance of all the covenants and conditions, including
covenants relating to payment of principal, interest, premium and Additional Amounts, of the Unsecured Indenture to be
performed by the Company;

(c) immediately before and after giving effect to such transaction or series of transactions on a Pro forma basis (and treating any
Debt which becomes, or is anticipated to become, an obligation of the Surviving Person or any Restricted Subsidiary as a result
such transaction or series of transactions as having been Incurred by the Surviving Person or such Restricted Subsidiary at the
time of such transaction or series of transactions), no Default or Event of Default shall have incurred and be continuing;

(d) immediately after giving effect to such transaction or series of transactions on a Pro forma basis (and treating any Debt which
becomes, or is anticipated to become, an obligation of the Surviving Person or any Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such
transaction or series of transactions as having been Incurred by the Surviving Person or such Restricted Subsidiary at the time
of such transaction or series of transactions), (i) the Company or the Surviving Person (if other than the Company) would be
able to Incur at least €1.00 of additional Debt under the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Certain
covenants—Limitation on Debt,” or (ii) the Consolidated Coverage Ratio would be greater than or equal to the Consolidated
Coverage Ratio immediately prior to giving Pro forma effect to such transaction or transactions; and

(e) in connection with any consolidation, merger, transfer or other transaction contemplated by this provision, the Company shall
deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Unsecured Notes Trustee, in form satisfactory to the Unsecured Notes Trustee, an
Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that such consolidation, merger, transfer or other transaction and
the supplemental indenture in respect thereto comply with this provision and that all conditions precedent herein provided for
relating to such transaction or transactions have been complied with.

Notwithstanding anything in this covenant to the contrary: (i) the Company (A) may merge with an Affiliate that has no material
assets or liabilities and that is incorporated or organized solely for the purpose of reincorporating or reorganizing the Company in any
state of the United States, the District of Columbia or any state which is a European Union Member State and (B) may otherwise
convert its legal form under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization, in each case, without complying with clause (e) of the
preceding paragraph and (ii) any transaction characterized as a merger under applicable law where each of the constituent entities
survives, shall not be treated as a merger for purposes of this covenant, but shall instead be treated as (x) an Asset Sale, if the result of
such transaction is the transfer of assets by the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, or (y) an Investment, if the result of such
transaction is the acquisition of assets by the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary.

Upon assumption by the Surviving Person of the obligations of the Company under the Unsecured Indenture, the Surviving Person
will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of the Company under the Unsecured Indenture, and
the predecessor (except in the case of a lease) and the Company will be released from its obligations under the Unsecured Indenture.

**_Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries_**

The Board of Directors of the Company may designate or redesignate any Subsidiary of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary
to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary if (i) the Subsidiary to be so designated does not own any Capital Stock, Redeemable Stock or Debt
of, or own or hold any Lien on any property or assets of, the Company or any other Restricted Subsidiary, (ii) the Subsidiary to be so
designated is not obligated by any Debt, Lien or other obligation that, if in default, would result (with the passage of time or notice or
otherwise) in a default on any Debt of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary and (iii) such designation complies with the
covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments.” For purposes of the covenant described under “—Limitation on
Restricted Payments,” “Investment” will include the portion (proportionate to the Company’s equity interest in a Restricted Subsidiary
to be designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary) of the Fair Market Value of the net assets of such Restricted Subsidiary at the time that

166


-----

such Restricted Subsidiary is designated an Unrestricted Subsidiary; provided, however, that upon a redesignation of such Subsidiary
as a Restricted Subsidiary, the Company will be deemed to continue to have a permanent “Investment” in an Unrestricted Subsidiary
in an amount (if positive) equal to (a) the company’s “Investment” in such Subsidiary at the time of such redesignation less (b) the
portion (proportionate to the Company’s equity interest in such Subsidiary) of the Fair Market Value of the net assets (as conclusively
determined by the Board of Directors of the Company in good faith) of such Subsidiary at the time that such Subsidiary is so redesignated a Restricted Subsidiary. Unless so designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, any Person that becomes a Subsidiary of the
Company or of any Restricted Subsidiary will be classified as a Restricted Subsidiary. Except as provided in the first sentence of this
paragraph, no Restricted Subsidiary may be redesignated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary. Any such designation by the Board of
Directors of the Company will be evidenced to the Unsecured Notes Trustee by the Company by promptly filing with the Unsecured
Notes Trustee a copy of the resolution of such Board giving effect to such designation and delivering an Officer’s Certificate, in form
satisfactory to the Unsecured Notes Trustee, certifying that such designation complies with the foregoing provisions.

The Company will not, and will not permit any Unrestricted Subsidiary to, take any action or enter into any transaction or series of
transactions that would result in a Person becoming a Restricted Subsidiary (whether through an acquisition, the redesignation of an
Unrestricted Subsidiary or otherwise) unless after giving effect to such action, transaction or series of transactions, on a Pro forma
basis, (i)(a) the Company could Incur at least €1.00 of additional Debt pursuant to the first paragraph of the covenant described under
“—Certain covenants—Limitation on Debt,” or (b) the Consolidated Coverage Ratio would be greater than or equal to the
Consolidated Coverage Ratio immediately prior to giving Pro forma effect to such transaction or transactions and (ii) no Default or
Event of Default would occur or be continuing.

**_Suspension of Certain Covenants When Unsecured Notes Rated Investment Grade_**

If on any date following the date of the Unsecured Indenture, (1) the Unsecured Notes are rated (a) Baa3 or better by Moody’s and
(b) BBB- or better by S&P (or, if either Moody’s or S&P ceases to rate the Unsecured Notes for reasons outside of the control of the
Company, the equivalent investment grade credit rating from Fitch Ratings or, in the absence of such, any other “nationally
recognized statistical rating organization” within the meaning of Rule 15c3-1(c)(2)(vi)(F) under the U.S. Exchange Act selected by the
Company as a replacement agency so that the Unsecured Notes are so rated by at least two such credit rating agencies); and (2) no
Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, then, beginning on that day and subject to the provisions of the
following paragraph, the covenants specifically listed under the following captions in this listing memorandum will be suspended:

(1) “—Limitation on Debt;”

(2) “—Limitation on Restricted Payments;”

(3) “—Transactions with Affiliates;”

(4) “—Limitation on guarantees of Debt by Restricted Subsidiaries;”

(5) “—Limitation on restrictions on distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries;” and

(6) “—Limitation on sales of assets and Restricted Subsidiary stock.”

During any period that the foregoing covenants have been suspended, the Company’s Board of Directors may not designate any of
its Subsidiaries as Unrestricted Subsidiaries pursuant to the covenant described above under the caption “—Restricted and
Unrestricted Subsidiaries.”

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the rating assigned by any such rating agency should subsequently decline to below Baa3 or
BBB-, as applicable, the foregoing covenants will be reinstituted as of and from the date of such Rating Decline, and, upon any such
event, the Company shall promptly notify the Unsecured Notes Trustee. Such covenants will not, however, be of any effect with
respect to actions properly taken during the period of suspension. Calculations under the reinstated “—Limitation on Restricted
Payments” covenant will be made as if the “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” covenant had been in effect since the date of the
Unsecured Indenture except that no Default will be deemed to have occurred by reason of a Restricted Payment made while that
covenant was suspended. There can be no assurance that the Unsecured Notes will ever achieve an investment grade rating or that any
such rating will be maintained.

**Defaults**

An “Event of Default” will occur under the Unsecured Indenture if:

(i) the Company fails to make any payment of interest (including Additional Amounts) on any Unsecured Note when the same
shall become due and payable, and such failure continues for a period of 30 days;

(ii) the Company fails to make the payment of the principal or premium, if any, on any Unsecured Note when the same becomes
due and payable at its Stated Maturity, upon declaration, redemption, acceleration, required purchase or otherwise;

(iii) the Company fails to comply with any of its respective covenants or agreements described under “—Certain covenants—
Consolidation, merger and sale of assets;”

(iv) the Company fails to comply with its obligations under the covenants described under “—Change of Control” above or under
the covenants described under “—Certain covenants” (other than a failure to purchase Unsecured Notes which will constitute
an Event of Default under clause (ii) and other than a failure to comply with “—Certain covenants—Consolidation, merger
and sale of assets” which will constitute an Event of Default under clause (iii)) and such failure continues for a period of 30
days after the notice specified below;

(v) the Company fails to comply with any of the covenants in the Unsecured Notes or the Unsecured Indenture (other than those
specified in clauses (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv)) and such failure continues for a period of 60 days after the notice specified below;

(vi) Debt of the Company or any Significant Restricted Subsidiary (or any other Restricted Subsidiary if such Debt is, or with the
giving of notice or the passage of time or otherwise may become, directly or indirectly, recourse to the Company or any
Significant Restricted Subsidiary) is not paid within any applicable grace period after final maturity or is accelerated by the
holders thereof and the total amount of such Debt unpaid or accelerated exceeds €20 million or its equivalent;

(vii) any judgment or decree aggregating in an uninsured amount in excess of €20 million or its equivalent at the time is rendered
against the Company or any Significant Restricted Subsidiary (or any other Restricted Subsidiary if such judgment or decree
is, or with the giving of notice or the passage of time or otherwise may become, directly or indirectly, recourse to the
Company or any Significant Restricted Subsidiary) and there is a period of 60 days following the entry of such judgment or
decree during which such judgment or decree is not discharged, waived or the execution thereof stayed or is not covered by
indemnities or third party insurance as to which the Person giving such indemnity or such insurer has not discharged
coverage and such default continues for ten days after the notice specified below;

(viii) the Company or any Significant Restricted Subsidiary pursuant to or within the meaning of any Bankruptcy Law (A)
commences a voluntary case, (B) consents to the entry of an order for relief against it in an involuntary case, (C) consents to
the appointment of a Custodian of it or for any substantial part of its property or (D) makes a general assignment for the
benefit of its creditors; or takes any comparable action under any laws relating to insolvency or laws having a similar effect
for creditors;

(ix) a court of competent jurisdiction enters an order or decree under any Bankruptcy Law that: (A) is for relief against the
Company or any Significant Restricted Subsidiary in an involuntary case, (B) appoints a Custodian of the Company or any
Significant Restricted Subsidiary or for any substantial part of its property, or (C) orders the winding up or liquidation of the
Company or any Significant Restricted Subsidiary; or any similar relief is granted under any foreign laws, and, in each case,
the order or decree remains unstayed and in effect for 60 days; or

(x) any Unsecured Note Guarantee ceases to be, or is asserted by any Unsecured Note Guarantor, or any Person acting on behalf
of any Unsecured Note Guarantor, not to be in full force and effect or enforceable in accordance with its terms (other than as
provided for in the Unsecured Indenture or any Unsecured Note Guarantee) and any such Default continues uncured for a
period of 21 days.

168


-----

A Default under clause (iv) or (v) will not be an Event of Default until the Unsecured Notes Trustee notifies the Company or the
Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Unsecured Notes then outstanding notify the Company and the
Unsecured Notes Trustee in writing of the Default and the Company does not cure such Default within the time specified after receipt
of such notice. Such notice must specify the Default, demand that it be remedied and state that such notice is a “Notice of Default.”

For the avoidance of doubt, the voluntary liquidation or dissolution of a Significant Restricted Subsidiary in connection with the
transfer of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of such Significant Restricted Subsidiary to another Significant Restricted
Subsidiary in compliance with the terms of the Unsecured Indenture shall not constitute an Event of Default.

The Company will deliver to the Unsecured Notes Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice in the form
of an Officer’s Certificate of any event which, with the giving of notice and the lapse of time, would become an Event of Default
under clause (iv) or (v), its status and what action the Company is taking or proposes to take with respect thereto.

If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default specified in clause (viii) or (ix)) occurs and is continuing, the Unsecured
Notes Trustee, by notice in writing to the Company, or the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Unsecured
Notes then outstanding by notice to the Company and the Unsecured Notes Trustee, may declare the principal of, premium, if any, and
accrued interest on all Unsecured Notes to be due and payable. Upon such declaration, such principal accrued interest will be due and
payable immediately. If an Event of Default specified in clause (viii) or (ix) occurs, the principal of and interest on all the Unsecured
Notes will ipso facto become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Unsecured
Notes Trustee or any Holders of the Unsecured Notes. After any such acceleration, but before a judgment or decree based on such
acceleration is obtained by the Unsecured Notes Trustee, the registered Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the
Unsecured Notes then outstanding may, under certain circumstances, rescind and annul such acceleration if all Events of Default,
other than the nonpayment of accelerated principal, premium or interest, have been cured or waived as provided in the Unsecured
Indenture.

The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Unsecured Notes by notice to the Unsecured Notes Trustee may
waive an existing Default and its consequences except (i) a Default in the payment of the principal of, premium if any, or interest on
an Unsecured Note or (ii) a Default in respect of a provision that cannot be amended without the consent of Holders of a percentage
higher than 50.1% of the aggregate principal amount of Unsecured Notes affected. When a Default is waived, it is deemed cured, but
no such waiver will extend to any subsequent or other Default or impair any consequent right.

The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Unsecured Notes may direct the time, method and place of
conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Unsecured Notes Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on
the Unsecured Notes Trustee. However, the Unsecured Notes Trustee may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the
Unsecured Indenture or that the Unsecured Notes Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of other Holders or would
involve the Unsecured Notes Trustee in personal liability; provided, however, that the Unsecured Notes Trustee may take any other
action deemed proper by the Unsecured Notes Trustee that is not inconsistent with such direction. Prior to taking any action under the
Unsecured Indenture, the Unsecured Notes Trustee will be entitled to indemnification satisfactory to it in its sole discretion against all
losses and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action.

A Holder of Unsecured Notes may not pursue any remedy with respect to the Unsecured Indenture or the Unsecured Notes unless:
(i) such Holder gives to the Unsecured Notes Trustee written notice stating that an Event of Default is continuing; (ii) Holders of at
least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Unsecured Notes then outstanding make a written request to the Unsecured Notes
Trustee to pursue the remedy; (iii) such Holder or Holders offer to the Unsecured Notes Trustee reasonable security or indemnity
against any loss, liability or expense; (iv) the Unsecured Notes Trustee does not comply with the request within 60 days after receipt
of the request and the offer of security or indemnity; and (v) the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Unsecured Notes do
not give the Unsecured Notes Trustee a written direction inconsistent with the request during such 60-day period.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Unsecured Note Guarantees may only be enforced by or at the discretion of the Unsecured
Notes Trustee (acting of its own volition or on the direction of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding
Unsecured Notes) (see “—Unsecured Note Guarantees”).

169


-----

**Amendments and waivers**

Subject to certain exceptions, the Unsecured Indenture and the Unsecured Notes may be amended or supplemented with the
consent of the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Unsecured Notes then outstanding (including
consents obtained in connection with a consent solicitation, tender offer or exchange for the Unsecured Notes) and any existing or past
default or compliance with any provisions may be waived with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in an aggregate
principal amount of the Unsecured Notes then outstanding. However, without the consent of Holders of at least 90% of the aggregate
principal amount of the outstanding Unsecured Notes affected thereby, no amendment may, among other things, (i) reduce the amount
of Unsecured Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment, (ii) reduce the rate of or extend the time for payment of interest on
any Unsecured Note, (iii) reduce the principal of or extend the Stated Maturity of any Unsecured Note, (iv) reduce the premium
payable upon the redemption of any Unsecured Note or change the time or times at which any Unsecured Notes may or shall be
redeemed, (v) make any Unsecured Note payable in money other than that stated in the Unsecured Note, (vi) impair the right of any
Holder of Unsecured Notes to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment on or with respect to any Unsecured Notes, or (vii)
release any security that may have been granted in respect of the Unsecured Notes under the Unsecured Indenture. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Unsecured Indenture may be amended with the consent of Holders of 66 2/3% of the aggregate principal amount of
outstanding Unsecured Notes to release an Unsecured Note Guarantee (if such consent is required by the Unsecured Indenture).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any Holder of the Unsecured Notes, the Company, the Unsecured Note
Guarantors and the Unsecured Notes Trustee may, among other things, amend or supplement the Unsecured Indenture and the
Unsecured Notes to cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency, to provide for the assumption by a Surviving Person of the
obligations of the Company under the Unsecured Indenture, to provide for the issuance of Additional Unsecured Notes in accordance
with the limitations set forth in the Unsecured Indenture to provide for uncertificated Unsecured Notes in addition to or in place of
certificated Unsecured Notes, evidence and provide for the acceptance and appointment under the Unsecured Indenture of a successor
trustee pursuant to the requirements thereof, comply with the rules of any applicable securities depository, conform the text of the
Unsecured Indenture, the Unsecured Notes or the Unsecured Note Guarantees to any provision of the description of the Unsecured
Notes to the extent that such provision in the description of the Unsecured Notes was intended to be a verbatim recitation of a
provision of the Unsecured Indenture, the Unsecured Notes or the Unsecured Note Guarantees to add Unsecured Note Guarantees
with respect to the Unsecured Notes or release an Unsecured Note Guarantor upon its designation as an Unrestricted Subsidiary or as
otherwise permitted by the Unsecured Indenture; provided, however, that the release is in accord with the applicable provisions of the
Unsecured Indenture to add to the covenants of the Company for the benefit of the Holders of the Unsecured Notes or to surrender any
right or power conferred upon the Company, or make any change that does not adversely affect the rights of any Holder of the
Unsecured Notes.

The consent of the Holders of the Unsecured Notes is not necessary under the Unsecured Indenture to approve the particular form
of any proposed amendment. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the proposed amendment. A consent to any
amendment or waiver under the Unsecured Indenture by any Holder of Unsecured Notes given in connection with a tender of such
Holder’s Unsecured Notes will not be rendered invalid by such tender.

After an amendment under the Unsecured Indenture becomes effective, the Company is required to mail to each registered Holder
of the Unsecured Notes at its address appearing in the security register a notice briefly describing such amendment. However, the
failure to give such notice to all Holders of the Unsecured Notes, or any defect therein, will not impair or affect the validity of the
amendment.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Unsecured Indenture and the Unsecured Note Guarantees will be discharged and will cease to be of further effect (except as
otherwise expressly provided for in the Unsecured Indenture) when either (i) all outstanding Unsecured Notes have been delivered
(other than lost, stolen or destroyed Unsecured Notes which have been replaced) to the Unsecured Notes Trustee for cancellation or
(ii) all outstanding Unsecured Notes not theretofore delivered to the Unsecured Notes Trustee for cancellation have become due and
payable by reason of the making of a notice of redemption or otherwise or will become due and payable by reason of the making of a
notice of redemption or otherwise within one year and the Company has irrevocably deposited with the Unsecured Notes Trustee cash
in euro or euro-denominated European Government Obligations or a combination thereof sufficient to pay at maturity or upon
redemption all outstanding Unsecured Notes, including interest thereon (other than lost, stolen or destroyed Unsecured Notes which
have been replaced), and, in either case, the Company has paid all sums payable by it under the Unsecured Indenture. The Unsecured

170


-----

Notes Trustee will be required to acknowledge satisfaction and discharge of the Unsecured Indenture on written demand of the
Company accompanied by an Officer’s Certificate at the cost and expense of the Company.

**Defeasance**

The Company may, at any time, terminate (i) all obligations under the Unsecured Notes, the Unsecured Note Guarantees and the
Unsecured Indenture (“legal defeasance option”) or (ii) obligations to comply with certain restrictive covenants, including certain of
the covenants described under “—Certain covenants” (“covenant defeasance option”). The Company may exercise its legal defeasance
option notwithstanding any prior exercise of their covenant defeasance option.

If the Company exercises its legal defeasance option, payment of the Unsecured Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event
of Default. If the Company exercises its covenant defeasance option, payment of the Unsecured Notes may not be accelerated because
of certain Events of Default described under “—Defaults” (not including, among others, Events of Default relating to nonpayment,
bankruptcy and insolvency events) or because of the failure of the Company to comply with certain covenants specified in the
Unsecured Indenture. If the Company exercises its legal defeasance option or its covenant defeasance option, each Unsecured Note
Guarantor will be released from all of its obligations with respect to its Unsecured Note Guarantee.

The Company may exercise its legal defeasance option or its covenant defeasance option only if (1) the Company irrevocably
deposits in trust with the Unsecured Notes Trustee cash in euro or euro-denominated European Government Obligations or a
combination thereof, for the payment of principal of and interest on the Unsecured Notes to maturity or redemption, as the case may
be; (2) the Company delivers to the Unsecured Notes Trustee a certificate from a nationally recognized firm of independent certified
public accountants expressing their opinion that the payments of principal and interest when due and without reinvestment will
provide cash at such times and in such amounts as will be sufficient to pay principal and interest when due on all the Unsecured Notes
to maturity or redemption, as the case may be; (3) 184 days pass after the deposit is made and during the 184-day period, no Default
described in clause (vii) or (viii) under “—Defaults” occurs which is continuing at the end of the period; (4) the deposit does not
constitute a default under any other agreement or instrument binding on the Company; (5) the Company delivers to the Unsecured
Notes Trustee an Opinion of Counsel satisfactory to the Unsecured Notes Trustee in its sole discretion to the effect that the trust
resulting from the deposit does not constitute, or is qualified as, a regulated investment company under the U.S. Investment Company
Act of 1940, as amended; (6) in the case of the legal defeasance option, the Company delivers to the Unsecured Notes Trustee an
Opinion of Counsel satisfactory to the Unsecured Notes Trustee in its sole discretion stating that (i) the Company has received from,
or there has been published by, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service a ruling, or (ii) since the date of the Unsecured Indenture there has
been a change in the applicable U.S. federal income tax law, to the effect, in either case, that, and based thereon such Opinion of
Counsel shall confirm that, the Holders of the Unsecured Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax
purposes as a result of such defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at
the same times as would have been the case if such defeasance had not occurred, provided, however, such Opinion of Counsel shall
not be required if all the Unsecured Notes will become due and payable on the Maturity Date within one year or are to be called for
redemption within one year under arrangements satisfactory to the Unsecured Notes Trustee; (7) in the case of the covenant
defeasance option, the Company delivers to the Unsecured Notes Trustee an Opinion of Counsel satisfactory to the Unsecured Notes
Trustee in its sole discretion to the effect that the Holders of the Unsecured Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S.
federal income tax purposes as a result of such covenant defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same
amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such covenant defeasance had not occurred; and (8)
the Company delivers to the Unsecured Notes Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all
conditions precedent relating to the defeasance and discharge of the Unsecured Notes have been complied with as required by the
Unsecured Indenture.

**Notices**

Notices to Holders of Unsecured Notes (while any Unsecured Notes are represented by one or more global notes) shall be
delivered to Euroclear and Clearstream for communication to entitled account holders, or in the case of definitive Unsecured Notes,
shall be given by mail to the addresses of Holders of such Unsecured Notes appearing on the register for such Unsecured Note, and in
each case shall be published (so long as the Unsecured Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and
the rules of that exchange so require) in a leading newspaper having general circulation in Luxembourg (which is expected to be the
_d’Wort) or on the website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange at www.bourse.lu._

**No personal liability of directors, officers, employees and stockholders**

No past, present or future director, officer, employee, incorporator, promoter, advisor or stockholder of the Company or any
Unsecured Note Guarantor, as such, will have any liability for any obligations of the Company or the Unsecured Note Guarantors
under the Unsecured Notes, the Unsecured Indenture, the Unsecured Note Guarantees or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by
reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each Holder of Unsecured Notes by accepting an Unsecured Note waives and releases all
such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Unsecured Notes.

**Concerning the Unsecured Notes Trustee**

Deutsche Trustee Company Limited will be the Unsecured Notes Trustee under the Unsecured Indenture. The Unsecured Notes
Trustee’s current specified address is Winchester House, 1 Great Winchester Street, London EC2N 2DB.

The Unsecured Indenture will provide that, except during the continuance of an Event of Default, the Unsecured Notes Trustee
will perform only such duties as are specifically set forth in the Unsecured Indenture. During the existence of an Event of Default, the
Unsecured Notes Trustee will exercise such rights and powers vested in it by the Unsecured Indenture, and use the same degree of
care and skill in its exercise as a prudent man would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of his own affairs.

Subject to such provisions, the Unsecured Notes Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers under
the Unsecured Indenture at the request of any holder of Unsecured Notes, unless such holder has offered to the Unsecured Notes
Trustee security and/or indemnity satisfactory to it against loss, liability or expense as provided in the Unsecured Indenture.

The Unsecured Indenture provides for the indemnification of the Unsecured Notes Trustee and for its relief from responsibility in
connection with its actions under the Unsecured Indenture. The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Unsecured Notes Trustee is
entitled to be paid amounts in respect of its fees, costs and expenses and claims under any indemnity in priority to payments to other
creditors, including holders of the notes. The Unsecured Indenture will provide that the Unsecured Notes Trustee may rely absolutely,
without further enquiry, on any certificates, reports, opinions or other documents (whether or not any such document contains any
limit on liability) from the Company, its subsidiaries, legal counsel, auditors, valuers and/or any other experts. The Unsecured Notes
Trustee will not be responsible for the adequacy or fitness of any of the collateral as security in relation to the notes. The Unsecured
Notes Trustee will not be responsible for any loss, expense or liability which may be suffered as a result of any inadequacy of the
collateral.

The Unsecured Indenture will contain certain limitations on the rights of the Unsecured Notes Trustee, should it become a creditor
of the Company, to obtain payments of claims in certain cases or to realize on certain property received in respect of any such claim as
security or otherwise. The Unsecured Notes Trustee will be permitted to engage in other transactions; provided that if the Unsecured
Notes Trustee acquires any conflicting interest, it must eliminate such conflict or resign.

**Paying agent and Registrar for the Unsecured Notes**

The Company will maintain a paying agent for the Unsecured Notes in (i) the City of London, and (ii) Luxembourg, for so long as
the Unsecured Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and its rules so require. The Company will
undertake to maintain a paying agent in a European Union Member State that is not obligated to withhold or deduct tax pursuant to
European Council Directive 2003/48/EC or any other Directive implementing the conclusions of the ECOFIN Council meeting of
November 26-27, 2000 or any law implementing or complying with, or introduced in order to conform to, such Directive. The initial
paying agents will be (i) Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, in London, and (ii) Deutsche Bank Luxembourg, S.A., in Luxembourg.

The Company will also maintain one or more registrars (each, a “Registrar”) with offices in Luxembourg and a transfer agent in
each of (i) the City of London and (ii) for so long as the Unsecured Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock
Exchange and its rules so require, Luxembourg. The initial Registrar will be Deutsche Bank Luxembourg, S.A.. The initial transfer
agents will be Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, in London and Deutsche Bank Luxembourg, S.A., in Luxembourg. The Registrar
and the transfer agent in Luxembourg will maintain a register reflecting ownership of certificated securities (“the Definitive
Registered Unsecured Notes”) outstanding from time to time and will make payments on and facilitate transfers of Definitive
Registered Unsecured Notes on behalf of the Company. Each transfer agent shall perform the functions of a transfer agent.

172


-----

The Company may change any paying agent, Registrar or transfer agent for the Unsecured Notes without prior notice to the
Holders of such Unsecured Notes. However, for so long as the Unsecured Notes are listed on the Euro MTF Market of the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange and its rules so require, the Company will deliver notice of the change in a paying agent, Registrar or
transfer agent on the website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange at www.bourse.lu. The Company or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries may act as paying agent or Registrar in respect of the Unsecured Notes.

**Consent to jurisdiction and service of process**

The Unsecured Indenture provides that the Company and each Unsecured Note Guarantor will irrevocably appoint CT Corporation
Systems as their agent for service of process in any suit, action or proceeding with respect to the Unsecured Indenture, the Unsecured
Notes or any Unsecured Note Guarantee brought in any U.S. federal or state court located in the Borough of Manhattan, City and State
of New York and that each of the parties submit to the jurisdiction thereof.

**Governing law**

The Unsecured Indenture will provide that it, each Unsecured Note Guarantee and the Unsecured Notes will be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York. The Intercreditor Agreement is governed by, and construed in
accordance with, English law.

Ownership of interests in the Rule 144A Global Notes (the “Restricted Book-Entry Interests”) and ownership of interests in the
Regulation S Global Notes (the “Unrestricted Book-Entry Interests” and, together with the Restricted Book-Entry Interests, the
“Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons that have accounts with Euroclear and/or Clearstream or persons that hold interests
through such participants.

Euroclear and Clearstream will hold interests in the Global Notes on behalf of their participants through customers’ securities
accounts in their respective names on the books of their respective depositaries. Except under the limited circumstances described
below, Notes will not be issued in definitive form.

Book-Entry Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be effected only through, records maintained by Euroclear and
Clearstream and their participants. The laws of some jurisdictions, including some states of the United States, may require that certain
purchasers of securities take physical delivery of those securities in definitive form. The foregoing limitations may impair your ability
to own, transfer or pledge Book-Entry Interests. In addition, while the Notes are in global form, holders of Book-Entry Interests will
not be considered the owners or “holders” of Notes for any purpose.

So long as the Notes are held in global form, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, will be considered the sole holder(s) of
the Global Notes for all purposes under the Indentures. In addition, participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and
Clearstream and indirect participants must rely on the procedures of the participants through which they own Book-Entry Interests to
transfer their interests or to exercise any rights of holders under the Indentures. Neither we nor the trustee nor any of our respective
agents will have any responsibility or be liable for any aspect of the records relating to the Book-Entry Interests.

**Payments on Global Notes**

Payments of any amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes (including principal, premium, if any, interest and Additional
Amounts, if any) will be made by us to the common depositary or its nominee for Euroclear and Clearstream. The common depositary
or its nominee will distribute such payments to participants in accordance with their procedures. Payments of all such amounts will be
made without deduction or withholding for or on account of any present or future taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges
of whatever nature except as may be required by law. If any such deduction or withholding is required to be made by any applicable
law or regulation of Luxembourg or otherwise as described under “Description of the Secured Notes—Additional Amounts” and
“Description of the Unsecured Notes,” then, to the extent described under “Description of the Secured Notes—Additional Amounts”
and “Description of the Unsecured Notes,” such Additional Amounts will be paid as may be necessary in order that the net amounts
received by any holder of the Global Notes or owner of Book-Entry Interests after such deduction or withholding will equal the net
amounts that such holder or owner would have otherwise received in respect of such Global Note or Book-Entry Interest, as the case
may be, absent such withholding or deduction. We expect that payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held
through those participants will be governed by standing customer instructions and customary practices.

Under the terms of the Indentures, we and the trustee will treat the registered holder of the Global Notes (e.g., Euroclear or
Clearstream (or their respective nominees)) as the owner thereof for the purpose of receiving payments and for all other purposes.
Consequently, neither we, the trustee nor any of our or the trustee’s agents have or will have any responsibility or liability for:

190


-----

(1) any aspect of the records of Euroclear or Clearstream or of any participant or indirect participant relating to or payments made
on account of a Book-Entry Interest, or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing the records of Euroclear or Clearstream or
any participant or indirect participant relating to or payments made on account of a Book-Entry Interest;

(2) Euroclear or Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant; or

(3) the records of the common depositary.

**Redemption of Global Notes**

In the event any Global Note, or any portion thereof, is redeemed, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg (or their respective
nominees), as applicable, will distribute the amount received by it in respect of the Global Note so redeemed to the holders of the
book-entry interests in such Global Note from the amount received by it in respect of the redemption of such Global Note. The
redemption price payable in connection with the redemption of such book-entry interests will be equal to the amount received by
Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg, as applicable, in connection with the redemption of such Global Note (or any portion thereof).
The Issuer understands that under existing practices of Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg, if fewer than all of the Notes are to
be redeemed at any time, Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg, will credit their respective participants’ accounts on a
proportionate basis (with adjustments to prevent fractions) or by lot or on such other basis as they deem fair and appropriate; provided,
however, that no book-entry interest of less than €50,000 principal amount may be redeemed in part.

**Currency of payment for the Global Notes**

The principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of, the Global Notes will be paid in
euro.

**Action by Owners of Book-Entry Interests**

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised us that they will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder of Notes only at the
direction of one or more participants to whose account the Book-Entry Interests in the Global Notes are credited and only in respect of
such portion of the aggregate principal amount of Notes as to which such participant or participants has or have given such direction.
Euroclear and Clearstream will not exercise any discretion in the granting of consents, waivers or the taking of any other action in
respect of the Global Notes. However, if there is an Event of Default under the Notes, Euroclear and Clearstream reserve the right to
exchange the Global Notes for definitive registered notes (“Definitive Registered Notes”) in certificated form, and to distribute such
Definitive Registered Notes to its participants.

**Transfers**

Transfers between participants in Euroclear and Clearstream will be effected in accordance with Euroclear and Clearstream’s rules
and will be settled in immediately available funds. If a holder of Notes requires physical delivery of Definitive Registered Notes for
any reason, including to sell Notes to persons in states which require physical delivery of such securities or to pledge such securities,
such holder of Notes must transfer its interest in the Global Notes in accordance with the normal procedures of Euroclear and
Clearstream and in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indentures.

The Global Notes will bear a legend to the effect set forth in “Notice to Investors.” Book-Entry Interests in the Global Notes will
be subject to the restrictions on transfers and certification requirements discussed under “Notice to Investors.”

Transfer of Restricted Book-Entry Interests to persons wishing to take delivery of Restricted Book-Entry Interests will at all times
be subject to such transfer restrictions.

Restricted Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of any Unrestricted Book-Entry
Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such
transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S or Rule 144 (if available) under the U.S. Securities Act.

191


-----

Any Book-Entry Interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Book-Entry
Interest in another Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the first mentioned Global Note and become a
Book-Entry Interest in such other Global Note, and, accordingly, will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other
procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in such other Global Note for as long as it remains such a Book-Entry Interest.

**Definitive Registered Notes**

Under the terms of the Indentures, owners of the Book-Entry Interests will receive Definitive Registered Notes only:

(1) if Euroclear or Clearstream notifies us that it is unwilling or unable to continue to act and a successor is not appointed by us
within 90 days; or

(2) if Euroclear or Clearstream so requests following an Event of Default under the Indentures.

**Information concerning Euroclear and Clearstream**

Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for participating organizations and facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities
transactions between their respective participants through electronic book-entry changes in the accounts of such participants.
Euroclear and Clearstream provide various services to their participants, including the safekeeping, administration, clearance,
settlement, lending and borrowing of internationally traded securities. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with domestic securities
markets. Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial institutions such as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks,
trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear or Clearstream is also available to others such as banks,
brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodian relationship with a Euroclear or Clearstream
participant, either directly or indirectly.

**Initial Settlement**

Initial settlement for the Notes will be made in euro. Book-Entry Interests owned through Euroclear or Clearstream accounts will
follow the settlement procedures applicable to conventional bonds in registered form. Book-Entry Interests will be credited to the
securities custody accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream holders on the business day following the settlement date against payment
for value on the settlement date.

**Secondary Market Trading**

The Book-Entry Interests will trade through participants of Euroclear or Clearstream and will settle in same-day funds. Since the
purchase determines the place of delivery, it is important to establish at the time of trading of any Book-Entry Interest where both the
purchaser’s and the seller’s accounts are located to ensure that settlement can be made on the desired value date.

**TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

The information provided below does not purport to be a complete analysis of the tax law and practice currently applicable in
Luxembourg, the United States, France or Spain and does not purport to address the tax consequences applicable to all categories of
investors, some of which may be subject to special rules.

Prospective purchasers of the Notes are advised to consult their own tax advisors as to the tax consequences of a purchase of Notes
including, without limitation, the consequences of receipt of interest and premium paid (if any), and the sale or redemption of the
Notes or any interest therein.

The summaries set out below are based upon Luxembourg, U.S., French or Spanish law as in effect on the date of this listing
memorandum and are subject to any change in such law that may take effect after such date. References in this section to holders of
Notes include the beneficial owners of the Notes. The statements regarding the Luxembourg and U.S. laws and practices set forth
below assume that the Notes will be issued, and transfers thereof will be made, in accordance with the Indentures.

**Luxembourg Taxation**

**_Withholding Tax, Income Tax_**

_Taxation of Interest_

There is no withholding tax for Luxembourg residents and non-residents on payments of interest (including accrued but unpaid
interest) in respect of Notes, nor is any Luxembourg withholding tax payable on payments received upon repayment of the principal or
upon an exchange of Notes except that in certain circumstances a withholding tax may be required to be made upon payments of
interest pursuant to (i) European Council Directive 2003/48/EC (the “EU Savings Directive”) or the law of December 23, 2005
(“Interest Withholding Tax Law”).

Under the EU Savings Directive, each EU Member State (a “Member State”) generally must provide to the tax authorities of
another Member State details of interest payments or similar income paid by a paying agent (within the meaning of article 4 of the EU
Savings Directive) within its jurisdiction to a residual entity (within the meaning of article 4.2. of the EU Savings Directive, a
“Residual Entity”) or to or for an individual (the “Beneficial Owner”) resident in the latter Member State, although certain Member
States are entitled to apply a withholding tax system during a transitional period.

The EU Savings Directive was implemented into Luxembourg law by a law of June 21, 2005, which is in effect as of July 1, 2005.
Due to certain bilateral agreements (the “Bilateral Agreements”), relevant dependant and associated territories and certain non-EU
States apply similar measures as of the same date.

According to the law of June 21, 2005 and the Bilateral Agreements, during the transitional period, a Luxembourg paying agent
may be required to withhold taxes on interest payments to Residual Entities or to Beneficial Owners who reside in an EU Member
State or relevant dependant and associated territories at a rate of 15% (the rate will increase to 20% on July 1, 2008 and to 35% on
July 1, 2011), unless the Residual Entities or the Beneficial Owner has opted for an exchange of information or has provided a tax
certificate in accordance with procedure laid down in the EU Saving Directive and the Bilateral Agreements.

By the Interest Withholding Tax Law, effective as of January 1, 2006, Luxembourg introduced a withholding tax of 10% for
interest payments made to Luxembourg individual residents and Residual Entities (within the meaning of article 4(2) of the EU
Savings Directive) established in other EU Member States or certain dependent and associated territories thereof, by a Luxembourg
paying agent. For an individual holder of Notes who is a resident of Luxembourg and who acts in the course of the management of his
private wealth, the 10% withholding tax is a final levy.

A holder of Notes is subject to Luxembourg income tax in respect of the interest paid or accrued on the Notes only if such holder
(i) is or is deemed to be a resident of Luxembourg for tax purposes and the interest has not been subject to the 10% final withholding
tax or (ii) has a fixed place of business, a permanent establishment or a permanent representation in Luxembourg, to which the Notes
are attributable.

193


-----

Responsibility for the withholding of tax in application of the above-mentioned Luxembourg laws of June 21, 2005 and December
23, 2005 is assumed by the Luxembourg paying agent, within the meaning of the EU Savings Directive and the Interest Withholding
Tax Law, and not by the issuer of Notes.

_Taxation of Capital Gains_

Gains realized by an individual holder of Notes, who acts in the course of the management of his private wealth and who is
resident in Luxembourg for tax purposes, are not subject to Luxembourg income tax, unless they are taxed as speculative capital gains.
Speculative capital gains realized on the sale of Notes within six months of their acquisition trigger taxation at the full income tax rate.
For an individual holder of Notes, the portion of the gain corresponding to accrued but unpaid interest will be considered as interest
income and will be taxed as described under “—Withholding Tax, Income Tax—Taxation of Interest.”

Gains realized by a corporate holder of Notes or by an individual holder of Notes, who acts in the course of the management of a
professional or business undertaking, who is resident in Luxembourg for tax purposes or who has a permanent establishment in
Luxembourg, to which the Notes are attributable, will be subject to Luxembourg income tax on the sale of Notes.

Gains realized by a non resident holder of Notes, who does not have a permanent establishment or fixed place of business in
Luxembourg to which the Notes are attributable, will not be subject to Luxembourg income tax on the sale of Notes.

**_Registration Taxes_**

It is not compulsory that the Notes be filed, recorded or enrolled with any court or other authority in Luxembourg or that
registration tax, transfer tax, capital tax, stamp duty or any other similar tax or duty be paid in respect of or in connection with the
execution, delivery and/or enforcement by legal proceedings (including any foreign judgment in the courts of Luxembourg) of the
Notes, except that in the event of court proceedings in a Luxembourg court (including but not limited to a Luxembourg Insolvency
Proceeding), registration of the Notes may be ordered by the court, and even in the absence of such order, could in principle be
required in the event the relevant Notes are produced either directly or by way of reference in any act introducing legal proceedings
(including but not limited to a Luxembourg Insolvency Proceeding). In such case, a fixed or an ad valorem registration duty calculated
on the amounts mentioned in the Notes shall apply and be payable by the party prevailing itself from the Notes. In principle,
registration would also be required, and the same registration duties would be due, if the Notes were produced, either directly or by
way of reference, before an official authority (“autorité constituée”) in Luxembourg.

**_Other Taxes_**

A corporate holder of Notes who is resident in Luxembourg for tax purposes or who has a fixed plan of business, a permanent
establishment or a permanent representation in Luxembourg, to which the Notes are attributable, must take into account the Notes for
purposes of Luxembourg net wealth tax currently levied at 0.5% per annum. An individual holder of Notes, whether resident or not in
Luxembourg is exempt from net wealth tax.

No estate or inheritance tax is levied on the transfer of Notes upon death of a holder of Notes in cases where the deceased was not
a resident of Luxembourg for inheritance tax purposes and no gift tax is levied upon a gift of Notes if the gift is not passed before a
Luxembourg notary or recorded in a deed registered in Luxembourg. Where a holder of Notes is resident for tax purposes in
Luxembourg at the time of his death, the Notes are included in its taxable estate for inheritance tax or estate tax purposes.

**EU Savings Directive**

On June 3, 2003, the EU Council of Economics and Finance Ministers adopted a Directive on the taxation of savings income (the
“EU Savings Directive”). Under the EU Savings Directive, Member States of the EU are required to provide to the tax authorities of
another Member State details of payments of interest (and other similar income) paid by a person within its jurisdiction to an
individual resident in such other Member State. However, for a transitional period, Belgium, Luxembourg and Austria are (unless
during such transitional period they elect otherwise) operating a withholding system in relation to such payments (with the ending of
such transitional period dependent upon the conclusion of certain other agreements relating to information exchange with certain other
countries).

**U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations**

TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH TREASURY DEPARTMENT CIRCULAR 230, INVESTORS ARE HEREBY NOTIFIED
THAT: (A) ANY DISCUSSION OF UNITED STATES FEDERAL TAX ISSUES IN THIS LISTING MEMORANDUM IS NOT
INTENDED OR WRITTEN TO BE USED, AND CANNOT BE USED, BY INVESTORS FOR THE PURPOSE OF AVOIDING
PENALTIES THAT MAY BE IMPOSED ON INVESTORS UNDER THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE; (B) SUCH
DISCUSSION IS WRITTEN IN CONNECTION WITH THE PROMOTION OR MARKETING OF THE TRANSACTIONS OR
MATTERS ADDRESSED HEREIN; AND (C) INVESTORS SHOULD SEEK ADVICE BASED ON THEIR PARTICULAR
CIRCUMSTANCES FROM AN INDEPENDENT TAX ADVISOR.

The following discussion is a general summary of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the purchase, ownership
and disposition of Notes to a U.S. holder (as defined below) that holds its Notes as a capital asset (generally, property held for
investment) and that purchases the Notes in the initial offering and at the “issue price” (as defined below). This summary is based on
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, (the “Code”), Treasury regulations, rulings, judicial decisions and administrative
pronouncements, all as in effect as of the date hereof, and all of which are subject to change or changes in interpretation, possibly with
retroactive effect.

This summary does not address all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may apply to holders that are subject to special tax
rules, including U.S. expatriates, insurance companies, tax-exempt entities, banks, financial institutions, persons subject to the
alternative minimum tax, securities-broker dealers, regulated investment companies, traders in securities that elect to use the mark to
market method of accounting for their securities, persons holding their Notes as part of a hedging, integrated, constructive sale or
conversion transaction or a straddle, or persons whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar. These holders may be subject to U.S.
federal income tax consequences different from those set forth below. If a partnership (including for this purpose any entity treated as
a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) holds Notes, the tax treatment of a partner generally will depend upon the status of
the partner and the activities of the partnership. A partner in a partnership that holds Notes is urged to consult its tax advisor regarding
the specific tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the Notes.

For purposes of this discussion, the term “U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of Notes (as determined for U.S. federal income
tax purposes) who is (a) a citizen or individual resident of the United States, (b) a corporation (or other entity taxable as a corporation)
created or organized in or under the laws of the United States or any state thereof or the District of Columbia, (c) an estate the income
of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source, or (d) a trust if a court within the United States can
exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more U.S. persons are authorized to control all substantial
decisions of the trust.

The “issue price” of a Note is equal to the first price at which a substantial amount of the Notes is sold for money other than to
bond houses, brokers or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents or wholesalers.
Rules under the Code relating to amortizable bond premium, acquisition premium or market discount may, in particular instances,
apply to U.S. holders that purchase the Notes at a time other than the initial offering or at a price other than the issue price. These U.S.
holders should consult their own tax advisors as to the possible applicability of these rules.

U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the specific Luxembourg and U.S. federal, state and local tax
consequences of purchasing, owning and disposing of Notes in light of their particular circumstances as well as any consequences
arising under the laws of any other relevant taxing jurisdiction.

**_Payments of Interest_**

It is anticipated that the Notes will not be issued with original issue discount for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In this case,
interest paid on the Notes (including a payment of any Additional Amounts) will be taxable to a U.S. holder as ordinary interest
income at the time the interest is received or accrued, depending on the U.S. holder’s method of accounting for U.S. tax purposes.

A cash basis U.S. holder will be required to include in gross income the U.S. dollar value of the interest payment, based on the
spot exchange rate on the date of receipt, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars at that time. A cash

195


-----

basis U.S. holder will not realize exchange gain or loss on the receipt of the interest income but may recognize exchange gain or loss
upon the actual disposition of the euros so received.

An accrual method U.S. holder may determine the amount of income recognized with respect to such interest in accordance with
either of two methods. Under the first method, and accrual method U.S. holder will be required to include in gross income the interest
income that has accrued on the Notes in euros and translate that amount into U.S. dollars at the average rate of exchange in effect for
the interest accrual period (or, with respect to an accrual period that spans two taxable years at the average rate for the partial period
within the U.S. holder’s taxable year). (The average rate of exchange for an interest accrual period (or partial period) is the simple
average of the spot exchange rates for each business day of the period or other average rate for the period that is reasonably derived
and consistently applied by the holder.) Under the second method, an accrual method U.S. holder may make an election to translate
interest income at the spot rate on (i) the last day of the interest accrual period, (ii) the last day of the taxable year in the case of a
partial accrual period, or (iii) the date of receipt or payment if the last day of the interest accrual period is within five business days.
This election must be applied consistently to all debt instruments from year to year and cannot be changed without the consent of the
Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”). An accrual method U.S. holder generally will realize exchange gain or loss with respect to
accrued interest income on the date the interest payment actually is received. The amount of exchange gain or loss to be recognized by
the holder will be an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of the euro interest payment received
(determined on the basis of the spot rate on the date the interest income is received) in respect of the accrual period and the U.S. dollar
value of the interest income that has accrued during the accrual period (as determined above). This exchange gain or loss generally
will be treated as U.S.-source ordinary income or loss and generally will not be treated as an adjustment to interest income or expense.

Interest paid on the Notes (including the payment of any Additional Amounts) generally will constitute foreign-source income. For
purposes of computing allowable foreign tax credits for U.S. tax purposes, interest generally will be treated as “passive income” or,
for certain other U.S. holders, “financial services income.” For taxable years beginning after December 31, 2006, interest income
generally will constitute “passive category” income, or in the case of certain U.S. holders, “general category” income for foreign tax
credit purposes. The rules relating to foreign tax credits and the timing thereof are complex and U.S. holders should consult their own
tax advisors regarding the availability of a foreign tax credit and the application of the foreign tax credit limitations to their particular
situation.

**_Sale or Other Disposition_**

Upon the sale or other disposition of the Notes, a U.S. holder generally will recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the
difference between the amount realized (other than amounts attributable to accrued and unpaid interest, which will be taxable as
ordinary interest income in accordance with the U.S. holder’s method of tax accounting) and the holder’s adjusted tax basis in the
Notes. A U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Notes generally will be the amount the holder paid for the Note less any principal
payments previously received by the holder. The cost of a Note will be the U.S. dollar value of the euro purchase price on the date of
purchase, calculated at the spot rate in effect on that date. If the Notes are traded on an established securities market, a cash method
taxpayer and an electing accrual method taxpayer will determine the U.S. dollar value of the amount realized by translating that
amount at the spot rate on the settlement date of the sale or other disposition, and will determine the U.S. dollar value of the cost of the
Notes at the spot rate on the settlement date of the purchase. If an accrual method taxpayer makes this election, the election must be
applied consistently by the taxpayer from year to year and once made cannot be revoked without the consent of the IRS.

Except as discussed in the following paragraph with respect to exchange gains or losses, any gain or loss recognized upon the sale
or other disposition of the Notes by a U.S. holder generally will be U.S.-source capital gain or loss, and will be treated as long-term
capital gain or loss if the Notes have been held for more than one year at the time of the sale or other disposition. Capital gains
recognized by an individual U.S. holder generally are subject to U.S. federal income taxation at preferential rates if specified
minimum holding periods are met. Capital gains of a corporate U.S. holder generally are taxable at the regular rates applicable to
corporations. The deductibility of capital losses for all taxpayers is subject to significant limitations.

Gain or loss realized upon the sale or other disposition of the Notes that is attributable to fluctuations in currency exchange rates
will constitute exchange gain or loss with respect to the principal amount to the extent provided under special rules. This exchange
gain or loss generally will be taxable as U.S.-source ordinary income or loss, but generally will not be treated as interest income or
expense. For these purposes, the principal amount of a Note is a U.S. holder’s purchase price for the Note calculated in euro on the
date of purchase. A U.S. holder will recognize exchange gain or loss on the principal amount of the Notes equal to the difference
between (i) the U.S. dollar value of the euro principal amount of the Notes determined at the spot rate on the date of the sale or other

196


-----

disposition and (ii) the U.S. dollar value of the euro principal amount of the Notes determined at the spot rate on the date the U.S.
holder acquired the Notes. However, a U.S. holder will recognize exchange gain or loss only to the extent of the total gain or loss
realized on the sale or other disposition of the Notes.

**_Receipt of Euro_**

A U.S. holder may receive euro in payment for interest or principal. The tax basis of any euro received by a U.S. holder generally
will equal the U.S. dollar equivalent of the euro at the spot rate on the date the euro are received. Upon any subsequent conversion or
other disposition of the euro for U.S. dollars, a U.S. holder generally will recognize exchange gain or loss equal to the difference
between the amount of U.S. dollars received and the U.S. holder’s tax basis in the euro. In addition, upon any subsequent exchange of
euro for property (including non-U.S. currency), a U.S. holder generally will recognize exchange gain or loss equal to the difference
between the U.S. dollar value of the euro exchanged based on the U.S. dollar spot rate for euro on the date of the exchange and the
U.S. holder’s tax basis in the euro so exchanged. Exchange gain or loss generally will be treated as U.S.-source ordinary income or
loss.

**_Tax Return Disclosure Requirements_**

A U.S. holder may be required to report a sale or other disposition of its Notes on IRS Form 8886 (Reportable Transaction
Disclosure Statement) if it recognizes exchange loss that exceeds US$50,000 in a single taxable year from a single transaction, if such
U.S. holder is an individual or trust. Higher minimum amounts apply for other non-individual U.S. holders. U.S. holders are urged to
consult their tax advisors in this regard.

**_U.S. Information Reporting and Backup Withholding_**

Payments of interest on and proceeds from the sale or other disposition of the Notes may be subject to information reporting to the
IRS and backup withholding at a current rate of 28%. Certain exempt recipients (such as corporations) are not subject to these
information reporting requirements. Backup withholding will not apply to a holder who furnishes a correct taxpayer identification
number and makes any other required certification, or who is otherwise exempt from backup withholding. U.S. persons who are
required to establish their exempt status generally must provide IRS Form W-9 (Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and
Certification). Non-U.S. holders generally will not be subject to U.S. information reporting or backup withholding. However, these
holders may be required to provide certification of non-U.S. status (generally on IRS Form W-8BEN) in connection with payments
received in the United States or through certain U.S.-related financial intermediaries. Backup withholding is not an additional tax.
Amounts withheld as backup withholding may be credited against a holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability. A holder may obtain a
refund of any excess amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules by timely filing the appropriate claim for refund with the
IRS and furnishing any required information.

**French Taxation**

**_Residents of France for Tax Purposes_**

_Individuals Holding Notes as Part of Their Private Assets_

_Interest and redemption premium. Income from the Notes received by individuals holding the Notes as part of their private assets_
is either included in total income, which is subject to:

   - personal income tax calculated on a progressive scale;

   - a general social contribution (contribution sociale généralisée or CSG) at the rate of 8.2%, 5.8% of which is deductible from
taxable income;

   - a social levy (prélèvement social) of 2%;

   - an additional contribution of 0.3% to the social levy of 2%; and

197


-----

   - a social debt repayment contribution (contribution au remboursement de la dette sociale, or CRDS) of 0.5%;

or, at the taxpayer’s option, subject to a final withholding tax at the rate of 16%; plus:

   - a general social contribution (CSG) at the rate of 8.2%, 5.8% of which is deductible from the taxable income;

   - a social levy (prélèvement social) of 2%;

   - an additional contribution of 0.3% to the social levy of 2%; and

   - a social debt repayment contribution (CRDS) of 0.5%.

_Luxembourg withholding tax on interest income. If withholding tax is required to be made in Luxembourg upon the payment of_
interest to French individual residents pursuant to the European Council Directive 2003/48/EC (the “Tax Savings Directive”) as
implemented into Luxembourg law by a law of June 21, 2005 (see “Tax Considerations—Luxembourg Taxation—Withholding Tax,
Income Tax—Taxation of Interest”), such withholding tax gives right to a tax credit in France. The tax credit may be offset against the
personal income tax levied on the gross interests payments (i.e., the net amount received, increased by the amount of Luxembourg
withholding tax applied) and the excess, if any, is refundable.

_Capital gains. Capital gains on the disposal of securities are taxable, from the first euro, where the aggregate amount of disposals_
of securities per tax household for the calendar year exceeds a certain threshold, set at €20,000 for 2007, and which will be increased
annually in the same proportion as the upper limit of the first bracket of the personal income tax scale. When such threshold is
exceeded, the capital gains are taxed at a rate of 16% to which is added:

   - a general social contribution (CSG) at the rate of 8.2% (not deductible from taxable income);

   - a social levy (prélèvement social) of 2%;

   - an additional contribution of 0.3% to the social levy of 2%; and

   - a social debt repayment contribution (CRDS) of 0.5%.

Capital losses incurred in one year can only be off-set against capital gains of a similar nature realized in the same year or in the
ten following years provided that in the year in which capital losses are incurred, disposals are in excess of the above-mentioned
threshold currently set at €20,000.

_Wealth tax. Notes held by individuals are included in their taxable assets subject to wealth tax._

_Duties on inheritance and gifts. Notes acquired by way of inheritance or gift are subject to French inheritance and gifts duties._

_Legal Entities Subject to Corporate Income Tax_

_Interest and redemption premium. Interest accrued on Notes over the fiscal year is included in taxable income subject to corporate_
tax at the rate of 33.33%. In addition, a social contribution of 3.3% is also applicable. This contribution is calculated on the amount of
corporate tax with an allowance of €763,000 for each 12-month period. However, with respect to entities that have a turnover of less
than €7,630,000 and whose share capital is fully paid-up and of which at least 75% is held continuously by individuals or by an entity
meeting all of these requirements, the corporate tax rate is set, within the limit of €38,120 of taxable income for every 12-month
period, at 15%. These companies are exempt from the 3.3% social contribution mentioned above.

In accordance with Article 238 _septies_ E of the Code Général des Impôts (“CGI”), companies must include a portion of the
redemption premium, which they record at the time of the subscription or acquisition of the Notes, into the taxable results for each of
their fiscal years, each time this premium exceeds 10% of the acquisition price. For the purpose of these provisions, redemption
premium means the difference between the sums potentially received from the Issuer, exclusive of straight line interest paid each year,
and the sums paid on subscription or acquisition of the Notes. However, these provisions do not apply to Notes whose average issue

198


-----

price is higher than 90% of the redemption value. The taxable annuity is obtained by applying the annual yield determined at the date
of acquisition to the acquisition price. This price is increased each year by a portion of the premium capitalized each year on the date
on which the redemption date falls. The yield is the annual rate which, on the acquisition date, equals, at that rate and on a compound
interest basis, the current value of the amounts to be paid and the amounts to be received.

_Capital gains. Disposals of Notes give rise to a gain or loss to be included in taxable income. The amount of the gain or loss is_
equal to the difference between the disposal price and the subscription or acquisition price of the Notes increased, as the case may be,
by the amounts of redemption premium already taxed in accordance with Article 238 septies E of the CGI and not yet received, and is
included in the results subject to corporate tax at the rate of 33.33% (or, within the limit of €38,120 for every 12-month period, at a
rate of 15% for companies that fulfill the conditions described above). Where applicable, the social contribution of 3.3% is to be added
in accordance with the conditions mentioned above.

**_Non-Residents of France for Tax Purposes_**

Individual holders of the Notes which are not resident in France for tax purposes will not be subject to French taxation on any
income derived from the Notes, including receipt of interest income, redemption premium paid, if any, and income from a sale of
Notes, assuming the Notes are not deposited in France. Notwithstanding the above, Notes acquired by way of inheritance or gift by an
individual who is a French resident for tax purposes will be subject to French inheritance and gift duties, subject to the application of
double taxation treaties signed by France with certain countries regarding gift and inheritance duties.

A corporate holder of the Notes who is not a resident in France for tax purposes and has no permanent establishment in France to
which the Notes are attributable will not be subject to any French taxation on income derived from the Notes, including receipt of
interest income, redemption premium paid, if any, and income from a sale of Notes.

**Spanish Taxation**

**_Introduction_**

This section does not purport to deal with all aspects of Spanish taxation that relate to an investment in Notes or that may be
relevant to particular investors in light of their personal circumstances. If you are considering buying Notes, you should consult your
own tax advisor concerning the tax consequences of holding the Notes in your particular situation.

**_Taxation of Payments under the Guarantees under the Spanish Resident Guarantors’s Current Situation_**

In the event that any payments of principal or interest are made under the Guarantees by Spanish resident Guarantors, these may be
characterized by the Spanish tax authorities as an indemnity and, accordingly, may be made free and clear of withholding or deduction
of any taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges of any nature whatsoever which may be imposed, levied, collected,
withheld or assessed by the Kingdom of Spain or any political subdivision or authority thereof or therein having power to tax.

However, although no clear precedent, statement of law or regulation exists in relation thereto, the Spanish tax authorities may
take the view that a Guarantor resident in Spain has validly, legally and effectively assumed (whether contractually or by any other
means) all of the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes, subject to and in accordance with the Guarantee of such Guarantor. In such
a case, the Spanish tax authorities may treat part of the payments made by such Guarantor to the holders of the Notes under such
Guarantee as Spanish source interest and attempt to impose withholding tax at the current rate of 18% on the payments by such
Guarantor on the Notes.

In the event that part of the payments made by a Spanish Guarantor are treated by the Spanish tax authorities as Spanish source
interest, no withholding would apply for the following types of holders of the Notes: (i) holders that are resident for tax purposes in a
European Union Member State other than Spain, and that are not acting through countries or territories considered as tax havens
pursuant to Royal Decree 1080/1991, of July 5, 1991; (ii) holders that pay corporate income tax in Spain; and (iii) holders that are
non-residents of Spain acting through a permanent establishment in Spain.

In the case of (i) above, for withholding to be avoided, the holder must provide to the applicable Spanish Guarantor a certificate of
residence issued by the tax authorities of the jurisdiction in which the holder resides, prior to any payment, and such certificate must

199


-----

be valid for one year from issuance. In the cases of (ii) and (iii) above, the Paying Agent must be provided with a list of those
investors who are, as the case may be, Spanish corporate income tax payers or non-residents of Spain acting through a permanent
establishment in Spain, together with their name, address, tax identification number, ISIN code of the Notes, principal amount of
Notes held at each Interest Payment Date, gross income and amount withheld.

Additionally, such withholding tax, if any, may be reduced or eliminated under an applicable income tax treaty to which the
Kingdom of Spain is a party. The applicability of a reduced tax rate or exemption shall be evidenced by the appropriate document as
set out in the order, if any, implementing the applicable tax treaty.

**_Income Taxation of Spanish Resident Noteholders_**

Interest payments and capital gains realized by individual holders of the Notes who are resident for tax purposes in Spain will be
subject to taxation at the fixed tax rate of 18%. Should any withholding tax be applied, taxation may be reduced or eliminated upon
application of the corresponding provisions.

Interest payments and capital gains realized by corporate holders of the Notes that are resident for tax purposes in Spain and
subject to the regular provisions of the Spanish Corporate Income Tax Act or non-resident for tax purposes in Spain and are holders
acting through a permanent establishment in the Spanish territory to which such income is attributable, will be subject to taxation at
the corresponding Spanish corporate income tax rate. For tax periods commencing on January 1, 2007, the Spanish corporate income
tax rate is set at 32.5%, which will be lowered to 30% for tax periods commencing on January 1, 2008. Should any withholding tax be
applied, taxation may be reduced or eliminated upon application of the corresponding provisions.

**_Other Taxes_**

_Net Wealth Tax_

Holders who are individuals resident for tax purposes in Spain are subject to net wealth tax in accordance with the rules set forth
by Spanish law, whereas holders who are non-resident for tax purposes in Spain will not be subject to net wealth tax to the extent that
the Notes are not deemed to be located, exercisable or enforceable in the Spanish territory. Finally, even if the Notes are located,
exercisable or enforceable in the Spanish territory, an exemption of this tax applies to holders that are individuals resident in any
country of the European Union who are entitled to the aforementioned exemption on the income derived from the Notes.

Corporate holders of the Notes, either resident or non-resident for tax purposes in Spain, are not subject to this tax.

_Inheritance and Gift Tax_

Notes acquired by individuals who are resident for tax purposes in Spain by way of inheritance or gift will be subject to inheritance
and gift tax in accordance with the rules set forth by Spanish Law.

Notes acquired by corporations that are resident for tax purposes in Spain by way of inheritance or gift will not be subject to
inheritance and gift tax but to corporate income tax.

Notes acquired by any non-resident for tax purposes in Spain by way of inheritance or gift will not be subject to inheritance and
gift tax to the extent that the Notes are not deemed to be located, exercisable or enforceable in the Spanish territory.

**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**

The Issuer, the Guarantors and the Initial Purchasers have entered into a purchase agreement, dated February 2, 2007, with respect
to the Notes. Subject to certain conditions contained in the purchase agreement, the Initial Purchasers have agreed to purchase, and the
Issuer has agreed to sell, all of the Notes. The purchase agreement with respect to the Notes provides that the obligations of the Initial
Purchasers to purchase and accept delivery of the Notes are subject to the approval by their counsel of certain legal matters and to
certain other conditions.

The purchase price for the Notes is the initial offering price set forth on the cover page of this listing memorandum less an initial
purchaser discount. The Initial Purchasers propose to offer the Notes at the initial offering price. After the Notes are released for sale,
the Initial Purchasers may change the offering price and other selling terms.

The Notes have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act. The Initial Purchasers have agreed that they will
only offer or sell the Notes (1) outside the United States in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S under the U.S. Securities
Act and (2) in the United States to QIBs in reliance on Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act. The terms used above have the
meanings given to them by Regulation S and Rule 144A.

In connection with the sales outside the United States, the Initial Purchasers have agreed that they will not offer, sell or deliver the
Notes to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons (1) as part of the Initial Purchasers’ distribution at any time or (2) otherwise
until 40 days after the later of the commencement of this offering or the date the Notes were originally issued. The Initial Purchasers
will send to each dealer to whom they sell such Notes during such 40-day period a confirmation or other notice setting forth the
restrictions on offers and sales of the Notes within the United States by a dealer or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons.

In addition, until 40 days after the commencement of the offering, an offer or sale of any Notes within the United States by any
dealer (whether or not participating in the offering) may violate the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act if such offer or
sale is made otherwise than in accordance with Rule 144A or pursuant to another exemption from registration under the U.S.
Securities Act.

Delivery of the Notes will be made against payment therefor on or about the seventh London business day following the date of
pricing of the Notes (such settlement being referred to as “T+7”). Pursuant to Rule 15(c)6-1 under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in three business days unless the parties to any such
trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the notes on the date of pricing or the next six succeeding
business days will be required, by virtue of the fact that the Notes will initially settle in T+7, to specify an alternative settlement cycle
at the time of such trade to prevent failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who wish to trade the Notes on the date of pricing or the
next six succeeding business days should consult their own advisors.

In connection with the offering, Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch (or persons acting on its behalf) may purchase and sell Notes
in the open market. These transactions may include short sales, stabilizing transactions and purchases to cover positions created by
short sales. Short sales involve the sale by Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch of a greater number of Notes than it is required to
purchase in the offering. Stabilizing transactions consist of certain bids or purchases made for the purpose of preventing or retarding a
decline in the market price of the Notes while the offering is in progress.

These activities by Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch (or persons acting on its behalf) may stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect
the market price of the Notes. As a result, the price of the Notes may be higher than the price that otherwise might exist in the open
market. If these activities are commenced, they may be discontinued by Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch at any time and must end
no later than the earlier of 30 days after the issue date of the Notes and 60 days after the date of the allotment of the Notes. These
transactions may be effected in the over-the-counter market or otherwise.

Each of the Initial Purchasers also agrees that: (1) it has not offered or sold and, prior to the expiry of a period of six months after
the date of issue of the Notes, it will not offer or sell any Notes to persons in the United Kingdom except to persons whose ordinary
activities involve them in acquiring, holding, managing or disposing of investments (as principal or agent) for purposes of their
businesses or otherwise in circumstances which have not resulted and will not result in an offer to the public in the United Kingdom
within the meaning of the Public Offers of Securities Regulations 1995, as amended; (2) it has complied and will comply with all

201


-----

applicable provisions of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the “FSMA”) with respect to anything done by it in relation to
the Notes in, from, or otherwise involving the United Kingdom; and (3) it has only communicated or caused to be communicated, and
will only communicate or cause to be communicated, any invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the
meaning of Section 21 of the FSMA) received by it in connection with the issue or sale of any of the Notes in circumstances in which
Section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to us.

No action has been taken in any jurisdiction, including the United States, by us or the Initial Purchasers that would permit a public
offering of the Notes or the possession, circulation or distribution of this listing memorandum or any other material relating to us or
the Notes in any jurisdiction where action for this purpose is required. Accordingly, the Notes may not be offered or sold, directly or
indirectly, and neither this listing memorandum nor any other offering material or advertisements in connection with the Notes may be
distributed or published, in or from any country or jurisdiction, except in compliance with any applicable rules and regulations of any
such country or jurisdiction. This listing memorandum does not constitute an offer to purchase or a solicitation of an offer to sell in
any jurisdiction where such offer or solicitation would be unlawful. Persons into whose possession this listing memorandum comes
are advised to inform themselves about and to observe any restrictions relating to the offering of the Notes, the distribution of this
listing memorandum and resale of the Notes. See “Notice to Investors.”

The Issuer has agreed to indemnify the Initial Purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the U.S. Securities
Act. The Issuer will pay the fees and expenses related to this offering.

Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch and its affiliates have from time to time performed certain investment banking and other
financial services for us and our affiliates, for which it received customary fees and reimbursement of certain expenses. Deutsche
Bank AG, London Branch and certain of its affiliates are lenders to us, including in connection with the bank indebtedness that will be
repaid with the proceeds of the offering. In addition, Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch and its affiliates may in the future provide
investment banking or other financial services to us, for which they will receive customary fees.

Bayerische Hypo- und Vereinsbank AG and its affiliates have from time to time performed certain investment banking and other
financial services for us and our affiliates, for which it received customary fees and reimbursement of certain expenses. Bayerische
Hypo- und Vereinsbank AG and certain of its affiliates are lenders to us, including in connection with the bank indebtedness that will
be repaid with the proceeds of the offering. In addition, Bayerische Hypo- und Vereinsbank AG and its affiliates may in the future
provide investment banking or other financial services to us, for which they will receive customary fees.

Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria, S.A. and its affiliates have from time to time performed certain investment banking and other
financial services for us and our affiliates, for which it received customary fees and reimbursement of certain expenses. Banco Bilbao
Vizcaya Argentaria, S.A. and certain of its affiliates are lenders to us, including in connection with the bank indebtedness that will be
repaid with the proceeds of the offering. In addition, Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria, S.A. and its affiliates may in the future
provide investment banking or other financial services to us, for which they will receive customary fees.

**NOTICE TO INVESTORS**

The Issuer has not registered the Notes under the U.S. Securities Act and, therefore, the Notes may not be offered or sold within
the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not
subject to, the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act. Accordingly, the Notes are only to be offered and sold:

   - to QIBs in compliance with Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act; and

   - in offers and sales that occur outside the United States to foreign purchasers, that is, purchasers who are not U.S. persons.

The term “foreign purchasers” includes dealers or other professional fiduciaries in the United States acting on a discretionary basis
for foreign beneficial owners, other than an estate or trust, in offshore transactions meeting the requirements of Rule 903 of Regulation
S under the U.S. Securities Act. We use the terms “offshore transaction,” “U.S. person” and “United States” with the meanings given
to them in Regulation S.

If you purchase Notes, you will be deemed to have represented and agreed as follows:

(1) You understand and acknowledge that the Notes have not been registered under the U.S. Securities Act or any other applicable
securities laws and that the Notes are being offered for resale in transactions not requiring registration under the U.S. Securities
Act or any other securities laws, including sales pursuant to Rule 144A, and, unless so registered, may not be offered, sold or
otherwise transferred except in compliance with the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act or any other applicable
securities laws, pursuant to an exemption therefrom, or in a transaction not subject thereto, and in each case in compliance with
the conditions for transfer set forth in paragraph (4) below.

(2) You are not our “affiliate” (as defined in Rule 144), you are not acting on our behalf and you are either:

(a) a QIB and are aware that any sale of these Notes to you will be made in reliance on Rule 144A and such acquisition will be for
your own account or for the account of another QIB; or

(b) not a “U.S. person” as defined in Regulation S or purchasing for the account or benefit of a U.S. person (other than a
distributor) and you are purchasing Notes in an offshore transaction in accordance with Regulation S.

(3) You acknowledge that neither the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers nor any person representing the Issuer or the Initial Purchasers
has made any representation to you with respect to the Issuer or the offer or sale of any of the Notes, other than the information
contained in this listing memorandum, which listing memorandum has been delivered to you and upon which you are relying
in making your investment decision with respect to the Notes. You acknowledge that neither of the Initial Purchasers makes
any representation or warranty as to the accuracy or completeness of this listing memorandum. You have had access to such
financial and other information concerning us and the Notes, including an opportunity to ask questions of, and request
information from, the Issuer and the Initial Purchasers.

(4) You are purchasing Notes for your own account, or for one or more investor accounts for which you are acting as a fiduciary
or agent, in each case for investment, and not with a view to, or for offer or sale in connection with, any distribution of the
Notes in violation of the U.S. Securities Act, subject to any requirement of law that the disposition of your property or the
property of such investor account or accounts be at all times within your or their control and subject to your or their ability to
resell such Notes pursuant to Rule 144A, Regulation S or any other available exemption from registration available under the
U.S. Securities Act. You agree on your own behalf and on behalf of any investor account for which you are purchasing the
Notes, and each subsequent holder of these Notes by its acceptance of the Notes will agree, to offer, sell or otherwise transfer
such Notes prior to (x) the date which is two years (or such shorter period of time as permitted by Rule 144(k) under the U.S.
Securities Act or any successor provision thereunder) after the later of the date of the original issue of these Notes and the last
date on which the Issuers or any of their affiliates were the owner of such Notes (or any predecessor thereto) or (y) such later
date, if any, as may be required by applicable law (the “Resale Restriction Termination Date”) only:

(a) to us;

203


-----

(b) pursuant to a registration statement which has been declared effective under the U.S. Securities Act;

(c) for so long as the Notes are eligible for resale pursuant to Rule 144A, to a person you reasonably believe is a QIB that
purchases for its own account or for the account of another QIB to whom you give notice that the transfer is being made in
reliance on Rule 144A;

(d) pursuant to offers and sales to non-U.S. persons occurring outside the United States within the meaning of Regulation S; or

(e) pursuant to any other available exemption from the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act;

subject in each of the foregoing cases to any requirement of law that the disposition of the seller’s property or the property of an
investor account or accounts be within the seller or account’s control, and in compliance with any applicable state securities
laws.

The foregoing restrictions on resale will not apply subsequent to the Resale Restriction Termination Date. You acknowledge
that the Issuer, the trustee and the registrar reserve the right prior to any offer, sale or other transfer of the Notes pursuant to
clause (d) above prior to the end of the 40-day distribution compliance period within the meaning of Regulation S or pursuant
to clause (e) above prior to the Resale Restriction Termination Date of the Notes to require the delivery of an opinion of
counsel, certifications and/or other information satisfactory to us, the trustee and the registrar.

Each purchaser acknowledges that each Note will contain a legend substantially in the following form:

“THIS NOTE HAS NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE U.S. SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE “U.S.
SECURITIES ACT”), OR THE SECURITIES LAWS OF ANY STATE OR OTHER JURISDICTION. NEITHER THIS
NOTE NOR ANY INTEREST OR PARTICIPATION HEREIN MAY BE OFFERED, SOLD, ASSIGNED, TRANSFERRED,

THE HOLDER OF THIS NOTE BY ITS ACCEPTANCE HEREOF (1) REPRESENTS THAT (A) IT IS A “QUALIFIED

OR ANY AFFILIATE OF THE ISSUER WERE THE OWNERS OF THIS NOTE (OR ANY PREDECESSOR OF THIS
NOTE) AND (Y) SUCH LATER DATE, IF ANY, AS MAY BE REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW (THE “RESALE

COUNSEL, CERTIFICATIONS AND/OR OTHER INFORMATION SATISFACTORY TO THE ISSUER, THE TRUSTEE
AND THE REGISTRAR IS COMPLETED AND DELIVERED BY THE TRANSFEROR. THIS LEGEND WILL BE
REMOVED UPON THE REQUEST OF THE HOLDER AFTER THE RESALE RESTRICTION TERMINATION DATE.
AS USED HEREIN, THE TERMS “OFFSHORE TRANSACTION,” “UNITED STATES” AND “U.S. PERSON” HAVE
THE MEANINGS GIVEN TO THEM BY REGULATION S UNDER THE U.S. SECURITIES ACT.”

If you purchase Notes, you will also be deemed to acknowledge that the foregoing restrictions apply to holders of beneficial
interests in these Notes as well as to holders of these Notes.

(5) You acknowledge that the registrar will not be required to accept for registration of transfer any Notes acquired by you, except
upon presentation of evidence satisfactory to us and the registrar that the restrictions set forth herein have been complied with.

(6) You acknowledge that:

(a) the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers and others will rely upon the truth and accuracy of your acknowledgements, representations
and agreements set forth herein and you agree that, if any of your acknowledgements, representations or agreements herein
cease to be accurate and complete, you will notify us and the Initial Purchasers promptly in writing; and

(b) if you are acquiring any Notes as fiduciary or agent for one or more investor accounts, you represent with respect to each such
account that:

(i) you have sole investment discretion; and

(ii) you have full power to make the foregoing acknowledgements, representations and agreements.

(7) You agree that you will give to each person to whom you transfer these Notes notice of any restrictions on the transfer of the
Notes.

until the expiration of the “distribution compliance period” (as defined below), you shall not make any offer or sale of these
Notes to a U.S. person or for the account or benefit of a U.S. person within the meaning of Rule 902 under the U.S. Securities
Act. The “distribution compliance period” means the 40-day period following the issue date for the Notes.

(9) You understand that no action has been taken in any jurisdiction (including the United States) by the Issuer or the Initial
Purchasers that would permit a public offering of the Notes or the possession, circulation or distribution of this listing
memorandum or any other material relating to the Issuer or the Notes in any jurisdiction where action for that purpose is
required. Consequently, any transfer of the Notes will be subject to the selling restrictions set forth under “Plan of
Distribution.”

Each purchaser and subsequent transferee of Notes will also be deemed to have made the representations and warranties set forth
in “—ERISA Considerations,” below.

**ERISA Considerations**

Section 406 of the U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”) and Section 4975 of the Code
prohibit employee benefit plans and certain other retirement plans, accounts and arrangements that are subject to Title I of ERISA
and/or Section 4975 of the Code, as amended (“ERISA Plans”) from engaging in specified transactions involving plan assets with
persons or entities who are “parties in interest,” within the meaning of ERISA, or “disqualified persons,” within the meaning of
Section 4975 of the Code, unless an exemption is available. A party in interest or disqualified person who engaged in a non-exempt
prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. In addition, the
fiduciary of the ERISA Plan that engaged in such a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to penalties and liabilities under
ERISA and the Code. The acquisition and/or holding of Notes by an ERISA Plan with respect to which the Issuer or any Initial
Purchaser is considered a party in interest or a disqualified person may constitute or result in a direct or indirect prohibited transaction

205


-----

under Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code, unless the investment is acquired and is held in accordance with an
applicable statutory, class or individual prohibited transaction exemption.

Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA provides an exemption from ERISA’s prohibited transaction rules for transactions between an
ERISA Plan and a person who is a party in interest solely because that person either provides services to the ERISA Plan or has a
specified relationship to a person who does, provided that the ERISA Plan receives no less or pays no more than “adequate
consideration” for such services. This exemption does not apply to a disqualified person or a party in interest that is a fiduciary or an
affiliate of a fiduciary, who has or exercises discretionary authority or control with respect to the investment of plan assets involved in
the transaction, or who renders investment advice with respect to those assets. In addition, the U.S. Department of Labor has issued
prohibited transaction class exemptions, or “PTCEs,” that may apply to the acquisition and holding of the Notes. These class
exemptions include, without limitation, PTCE 84-14 respecting transactions determined by independent qualified professional asset
managers, PTCE 90-1 respecting insurance company pooled separate accounts, PTCE 91-38 respecting bank collective investment
funds, PTCE 95-60 respecting life insurance company general accounts and PTCE 96-23 respecting transactions determined by inhouse asset managers, although there can be no assurance that all of the conditions of any such exemptions will be satisfied.

Because of the foregoing, the Notes should not be purchased or held by any person investing “plan assets” of any employee benefit
plan or other retirement plan, account or arrangement, including, without limitation, ERISA Plans, unless such purchase and holding
will not constitute a non-exempt prohibited transaction under ERISA or the Code or a violation of any applicable provisions under any
other federal, state, local, non-U.S. or other laws or regulations that are similar to Title I of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code
(collectively, “Similar Laws”).

In this regard, each purchaser and subsequent transferee of a Note will be deemed to have represented and warranted that either (i)
no portion of the assets used by such purchaser or transferee to acquire or hold the Notes (or any interest therein) constitutes assets of
any ERISA Plan or any employee benefit plan or other retirement plan, account or arrangement subject to any Similar Law or (ii) the
purchase and holding of the Notes (or any interest therein) by such purchaser or transferee will not constitute a non-exempt prohibited
transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or violation under any applicable Similar Laws.

The foregoing discussion is general in nature and is not intended to be all-inclusive. Due to the complexity of these rules and the
penalties that may be imposed upon persons involved in non-exempt prohibited transactions, it is particularly important that
fiduciaries, or other persons considering purchasing the Notes on behalf of, or with the assets of, any plan, consult with their counsel
regarding the potential applicability of ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code and any Similar Laws to such investment and whether an
exemption would be applicable to the purchase and holding of the Notes.

**SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT**
**OF CIVIL LIABILITIES**

The Issuer and certain of the Guarantors are incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg and all of the directors and executive
officers of the Issuer (or certain other persons named in this listing memorandum) and the Luxembourg Guarantors are non-residents
of the United States. Furthermore, a substantial portion of the assets of the Issuer and the Luxembourg Guarantors and a substantial
portion of the assets of such persons are located outside the United States. As a result, it may not be possible for investors to effect
service of process within the United States upon those persons, the Issuer or the Luxembourg Guarantors, or to enforce against them
judgments of U.S. courts predicated upon the civil liability provisions of U.S. federal or state securities laws.

We have been advised by our Luxembourg counsel that the United States and Luxembourg are not currently bound by a treaty
providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitral awards rendered in civil and commercial
matters. According to such counsel, an enforceable judgment for the payment of monies rendered by any U.S. Federal or state court
based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon the U.S. securities laws, would not directly be enforceable in
Luxembourg. However, a party who received such favorable judgment in a U.S. court may initiate enforcement proceedings in
Luxembourg (exequatur) by requesting enforcement of the U.S. judgment by the District Court (Tribunal d’Arrondissement) pursuant
to Section 678 of the New Luxembourg Code of Civil Procedure. The District Court will authorize the enforcement in Luxembourg of
the U.S. judgment if it is satisfied that all of the following conditions are met:

   - the U.S. judgment is enforceable (“exequatur”) in the United States;

   - the U.S. court awarding the judgment has jurisdiction to adjudicate the respective matter under applicable U.S. Federal or state
jurisdictions rules, and the jurisdiction of the U.S. court is recognized by Luxembourg private international and local law;

   - the U.S. court has applied to the dispute the substantive law which would have been applied by Luxembourg courts;

   - the principles of natural justice have been complied with;

   - the U.S. judgment does not contravene international public policy or order as understood under the laws of Luxembourg or has
been given in proceedings of a criminal nature;

   - the U.S. court has acted in accordance with its own procedural laws;

   - the U.S. judgment was granted following proceedings where the counterparty had the opportunity to appear, and if it appeared,
to present a defense; and

   - the U.S. judgment was not granted pursuant to an evasion of Luxembourg law (“fraude à la loi luxembourgeoise”).

Subject to the above conditions, Luxembourg courts tend not to review the merits of a foreign judgment, although there is no
statutory prohibition.

In addition, certain other Guarantors are entities organized under the laws of Italy or Spain.

The Guarantor organized under Italian law, Cartiere del Garda S.p.A., is a company with limited liability. All of its directors and
executive officers are non-residents of the United States. In addition, all of its assets and substantially all of the assets of its directors
and executive officers are located outside the United States. As a result, you may not be able to effect service of process within the
United of States upon Cartiere del Garda S.p.A. or its directors and executive officers or to enforce a judgment obtained against it or
its directors and executive officers in foreign courts predicated solely upon the civil liability provisions of U.S. securities laws.
Furthermore, we have been advised by our Italian counsel that there is doubt whether a lawsuit based upon U.S. federal or state
securities laws could be brought in an original action in Italy and whether a judgment obtained in a U.S. court based upon U.S.
securities laws would be enforced in Italy.

The Guarantors organized under Spanish law are companies with limited liability. All of the directors and executive officers of the
Spanish Guarantors are non-residents of the United States. In addition, all of the assets of the Spanish Guarantors and substantially all
of the assets of the directors and executive officers of the Spanish Guarantors are located outside the United States. As a result, you
may not be able to effect service of process within the United States upon any of the Spanish Guarantors or their directors and
executive officers or to enforce a judgment obtained against any of the Spanish Guarantors or their directors and executive officers in
foreign courts predicated solely upon the civil liability provisions of U.S. securities laws. Furthermore, we have been advised by our
Spanish counsel that there is doubt whether a lawsuit based upon U.S. federal or state securities laws could be brought in an original
action in Spain and whether a judgment obtained in a U.S. court based upon U.S. securities laws would be enforced in Spain.

**Auditor’s Report on the December 31, 2005**
**IFRS Consolidated Financial Statements**

**To the shareholders of Lecta S.A.**

We have audited the accompanying consolidated accounts of Lecta S.A. for the year ended December 31, 2005 and have read the
related management report. These consolidated accounts and the management report are the responsibility of the Board of Directors.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated accounts based on our audit and to check that the management report
is consistent with the consolidated accounts.

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing. Those Standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated accounts are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated accounts. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by the Board of Directors, as well as evaluating the overall
consolidated accounts presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

As discussed in Note 35.2 to the consolidated accounts, the Company does not disclose the information required by IAS 24 on key
management personnel compensation.

In our opinion, except for the omission of the information mentioned in the preceding paragraph, the accompanying consolidated
accounts give, in accordance with International Financial Report Standards as adopted by the EU, a true and fair view of the financial
position of Lecta S.A. as at December 31, 2005 and of the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended.

The management report is consistent with the consolidated accounts.

**Lecta S.A.**

**Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements**

**1. Summary of significant accounting policies**

**1.01. Basis of preparation**

The consolidated financial statements of Lecta Group have been prepared in accordance with the Standards and Interpretations
adopted by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). They comprise:

—  International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS),

—  International Accounting Standards (IAS),

—  Interpretations originated by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) or the former Standing
Interpretations Committee (SIC).

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on an historical cost basis, except for the measurement at fair value of
Investment properties (none in Lecta Group), Available-for-sale financial assets, Biological assets and Derivative financial
instruments. The carrying values of recognized assets and liabilities that are hedged are adjusted to record changes in the fair values
attributable to the hedged risks.

In the process of applying Lecta Group’s accounting policies, the Management has made the following judgments:

—  Each consolidated company has the ability to continue as a going concern.

—  Companies considered as Special Purpose Entities. There are two of them in Lecta Group (see Note 2.3).

—  Recognition of risks through provisions (see Note 29).

Management of Lecta Group made assumptions for the years to come. The macro-economic assumptions are based on figures
provided by well-established entities (banks and industry experts) adapted to the specificities of Lecta Group. These are inflation,
interest rates, exchange rates, prices, volumes, etc. Management used these assumptions to develop strategies and prepare plans. The
assumptions and the resulting plans are used in preparing the financial statements (e.g. computation of impairment tests, recognition of
Deferred income tax assets...). Actual results may differ from these estimates.

**1.02. Changes in accounting policies—New accounting standards**

On 1 January 2005, Lecta Group adopted for the first time the IFRSs. Therefore, the present consolidated financial statements are
compliant with the transitional rules defined in IFRS 1 “First-time adoption of international financial reporting standards”. The date of
transition to IFRSs is 1 January 2004.

Lecta Group elected to use the following exemptions from other IFRSs:

—  IFRS 3, Business combinations, was not applied retrospectively to business combinations that occurred before 1 January 2004.
These business combinations were dealt with according to Appendix B, paragraph B1 of IFRS 1.

—  At 1 January 2004, the Property, plant and equipment of Cartiere del Garda SpA were measured at fair value and these fair
values were used as deemed cost at that date. The values of Property, plant & equipment of all other companies as well as all
the Intangible assets used under the previous GAAP were maintained.

—  All cumulative actuarial gains and losses on employee benefits at 1 January 2004 were fully recognized.

228


-----

Other exemptions proposed by IFRS 1 were either not used or not applicable. Previously Lecta prepared its accounts in accordance
with French GAAP formalized in Regulation 99-02 approved by decree dated 22 June 1999 of the “Comité de Réglementation
Comptable”, the French accounting regulation commission. The reconciliations with the previous GAAP are provided in Note 3.1.

For the adoption of IAS 32, “Financial Instruments: Disclosures and presentation” and IAS 39, “Financial instruments:
Recognition and Measurement”, Lecta Group elected to use the exemption of IAS 39 (revised 2003), Appendix B, paragraph 36A:
The year of comparative information, 2004, does not comply with IAS 32 and IAS 39 but with the above mentioned previous GAAP.
The reconciliation between the closing Balance sheet at 31 December 2004 and the opening Balance sheet, at 1 January 2005 is
provided in Note 3.2.

Lecta Group made an early adoption of the revised version, dated December 2004 of IAS 19, Employee benefits. Lecta Group will
apply to actuarial gains and losses the treatment set out in paragraph 93A: they will be recognized in the period in which they occur
against equity, outside profit or loss.

**1.03. Basis of consolidation**

The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the parent company Lecta SA and its subsidiaries
(including Special Purpose Entities) drawn up to 31 December each year. Subsidiaries are entities in which Lecta Group has the sole
power to exercise control over their operations. All the consolidated subsidiaries are listed in Note 2.2.

Nevertheless, some subsidiaries (including Special Purpose Entities) of Lecta Group are not consolidated on the basis of
immateriality (see Note 2.3).

Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to Lecta Group and cease to be consolidated from the
date on which control is transferred out of Lecta Group.

All inter-company transactions, balances and unrealized gains on transactions between Lecta Group companies are eliminated.
Unrealized losses are also eliminated unless cost cannot be recovered. Where accounting policies followed by subsidiaries differ
significantly from those adopted for the purpose of the consolidated financial statements, appropriate adjustments are made in order to
achieve a consistent basis of accounting.

**1.04. Investment in associates**

An Associate is an entity, including an unincorporated entity such as a partnership, over which Lecta Group has significant
influence but which it does not control. It is neither a subsidiary nor a joint venture.

An associate is accounted for under the equity method of consolidation: The investment in an associate is initially recognized at
cost and adjusted thereafter for the post-acquisition changes in Lecta Group’s share of net assets of the associate. The Income
statement of Lecta Group includes Lecta Group’s share of the profit or loss of the associate.

Lecta Group doesn’t consolidate any associate.

**1.05. Interests in joint ventures**

A Joint venture is a contractual arrangement whereby Lecta Group and one or more third parties undertake an economic activity
that is subject to joint control.

A jointly controlled entity is accounted for under the proportionate method of consolidation or alternatively under the equity
method. Under the proportionate method, Lecta Group’s share of each of the assets, liabilities, incomes and expenses of this entity is
combined line by line with similar items in Lecta Group’s financial statements. The equity method has been described in Note 1.04.

Lecta Group doesn’t consolidate any joint venture.

229


-----

**1.06. Glossary**

EBITDA: Earnings before depreciation, amortization, unusual items, finance costs, net income from associates and income tax. It
includes non-cash (expenses) incomes, consisting of variations of inventories and operating provisions. This aggregate is a key
performance indicator for Lecta Group and the fine paper industry.

Unusual items: Costs isolated for a better understanding of the business performance. This heading comprises essentially:

—  the profit and losses on disposals or impairments of long-lived assets,

—  the financial or operational restructuring costs.

**1.07. Foreign currency transactions**

The functional and presentation currency of Lecta Group is the euro (EUR). For each entity of Lecta Group, transactions in foreign
currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies are retranslated at the rate of exchange ruling at the Balance sheet date. All the differences are taken to the Income
statement: Foreign exchange differences for operating business items are entered in the line “Other operating costs except unusual
items”. For financial items, they are entered in the line “Finance costs”. This last point could suffer an exception in the case of a
foreign currency borrowing that would provide a hedge against a net investment in a foreign entity. Nevertheless, Lecta Group does
not bear such borrowing.

**1.08. Foreign currency translations—subsidiaries**

The Income statements of the non-euro consolidated subsidiaries are translated at weighted average exchange rates for the year.
Their assets and liabilities are translated into euro at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. The exchange differences
arising on the retranslation are taken directly to Equity. On disposal of such entity, accumulated exchange differences are recognized
in the line “Unusual items” of the Income statement as a component of the gain or loss on disposal.

Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are stated in the currency of the acquiring entity
at the date of the acquisition.

Lecta Group doesn’t consolidate any company operating in hyper-inflationary economy.

**1.09. Revenue recognition**

Revenue is recognized to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to Lecta Group and the revenue can be
reliably measured. The following specific recognition criteria must also be met before revenue is recognized:

—  Sales of goods: In the great majority of cases, Revenue is recognized when the goods leave the warehouses of the Group or
those of the consignees. This method enables a reliable measurement of revenue. It acknowledges that the significant risks have
been transferred either to the buyer or to the transporter.

—  Interest: Revenue is recognized as the interest accrues.

—  Dividends: Revenue is recognized when the shareholders’ right to receive the payment is established.

**1.10. Property, plant and equipment**

Property, plant and equipment purchased by Lecta Group’s companies are stated at historical cost, augmented where appropriate
by terminal environmental reinstatement costs (none in Lecta Group). When they come into Lecta Group through the acquisition of a
new subsidiary, they are stated at their fair value at the date of acquisition.

230


-----

The property, plant and equipment present in Lecta Group at First Time Adoption, 1 January 2004, were subject to specific rules:
those of Cartiere del Garda SpA were fair valued and these fair values were used as deemed cost at that date, while the values of
property, plant & equipment of all other companies used under the previous GAAP were maintained. At closing date, property, plant
and equipment are stated at the above-described gross value less accumulated depreciation and any impairment.

Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the following estimate useful lives:

Lands............................................... No depreciation
Road, railways and car parks .......... 20 to 40 years
Buildings......................................... 30 to 40 years
Quality control systems................... 5 to 10 years
Plant and machinery........................ 10 to 20 years
Forklifts........................................... 3 to 8 years
Motor vehicles ................................ 3 to 7 years
Hardware and office equipments .... 3 to 5 years
R&D equipment.............................. 6 to 10 years
Furniture, fixtures and fittings ........ 10 years

**1.11. Maintenance**

Maintenance costs related to an existing tangible asset are capitalized if and only if it has a useful life of more than one year and if
it replaces an identifiable component of the existing tangible asset. This capitalization translates into the creation of a new component
that will be individually depreciated. The depreciation will not exceed the remaining useful life of the existing tangible asset except
when it extends its useful life. This capitalization also translates into derecognizing the replaced component. The maintenance of
existing Safety and Environment installations may be necessary to continue to obtain the future economic benefits from its other
assets. Under such circumstances, they may qualify for recognition as Property, plant and equipment. In other circumstances, they are
expensed. Recurring maintenance or day-to-day servicing (outside contractors, felt & wires...) are always expensed. The overhauls of
gas turbines of cogeneration plants are capitalized as Plant and machinery and depreciated over 3 to 6 years.

**1.12. Leases**

Leases, which transfer to Lecta Group substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the leased item, are
classified as finance leases. Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset are
classified as operating leases.

Finance leases are capitalized at the inception of the lease at the fair value of the leased property or, if lower, at the present value
of the minimum lease payments. Lease payments are apportioned between the finance charges and reduction of the lease liability so as
to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are included in the line “Finance costs”
of the Income statement. The lease liability is included in the line “Interest-bearing borrowings” of the Balance sheet. If there is a
reasonable certainty that Lecta Group will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term, the capitalized leases follow the same
depreciation policy than the similar owned assets. Otherwise, they are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the
asset or the lease term. In both cases, the depreciation is included in the line “Depreciation” of the Income statement.

Operating lease payments are recognized as an expense in the line “Other operating costs except unusual items” of the Income
statement in accordance with the terms of the lease.

**1.13. Investment properties**

Land or buildings, held to earn rentals or capital appreciation, are classified as Investment properties and stated at fair value. Gains
or losses arising from changes in the fair values of investment properties are included in the line “Unusual items” of the Income
statement, in the period in which they arise.

Lecta Group has no investment properties.

231


-----

**1.14. Goodwill**

Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of the acquisition over the fair value of identifiable net assets of a subsidiary, joint
venture or associate at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is not amortized. It is reviewed for impairment at each closing date.

The Negative goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of identifiable net assets of a subsidiary, joint venture or associate at
the date of acquisition over the cost of the acquisition. It is recognized immediately in the line “Unusual items” of the Income
statement.

**1.15. Other intangible assets**

Other intangible assets acquired separately are capitalized at cost. Intangible assets acquired as part of an acquisition of a business
are capitalized separately from Goodwill if the fair value can be measured reliably on initial recognition, subject to the constraint that,
unless the asset has a readily ascertainable market value, the fair value is limited to an amount that does not create or increase any
Negative goodwill arising on the acquisition. The carrying values of Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment when events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.

Other intangible assets created within the business are not capitalized and expenditure is charged against profits in the year in
which it is incurred.

Research and Development are related to product and process development. As such, they are part of a continuing improvement
process and not allocated to individual projects. Therefore, these costs are expensed as incurred.

Other intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis, over the shortest period between their own legal duration and the
useful life of the assets to which they benefit.

In Lecta group, this heading comprises essentially:

Patents ............................................................... 3 to 5 years
Trademarks........................................................ 3 to 5 years
Rights to connect to the electricity network...... 8 years
CO2 emission rights (see hereunder) ................ No amortization

**1.16. CO2 emission rights**

The European Union, as a consequence of its adhesion to the Kyoto protocol, has set up the CO2 emission rights scheme. Lecta
Group elected to use the implicit rule of IAS 20 “Accounting for government grants and disclosure of government assistance” to
account for the CO2 emission rights. This rule is sometimes referenced as “net liability method”: The rights that have been granted
free of charge by each National Authority are not recognized. A provision at fair value is recognized for the tons of CO2 emitted in
excess of the rights granted by each National Authority. Initially, purchased rights are recognized at cost in the line “Other intangible
assets” of the Balance sheet. After initial recognition, the rights that are not in excess of the above-mentioned provisioned tons are
measured at fair value. The rights in excess are kept at their historical cost, unless the market price drops below this cost. In such a
case, these rights are impaired. All the movements in the Income statement are in the line “Other operating costs except unusual
items”. These rules are implemented for each Company separately, because National Authorities grant the rights to single companies.

**1.17. Financial investments**

Financial investments are accounted for by considering the four categories defined by IAS 39, Financial instruments recognition
and measurement:

“Available-for-sale financial assets”, “Financial assets at fair value through the profit or loss”, “Held-to-maturity investments” and
“Loans and receivables originated by the enterprise”.

232


-----

Initially, all financial investments are recognized at cost, being the fair value of the consideration given and the acquisition costs
associated with the investment.

Then the accounting rules differ from one category to another:

Available-for-sale financial assets are acquired to be held for an indefinite period of time but may be sold due to changed strategic
decisions. In Lecta Group, available-for-sale investments are shares in companies that are not consolidated on the basis of
immateriality or because the percentage of control is too small. They are shown in the line “Available-for-sale financial investments”,
in the Non-current assets of the Balance sheet. After initial recognition, they are measured at fair value. Gains or losses are directly
recognized in the line “Net unrealized gains (losses)”, in the Equity of the Balance sheet, until the investment is sold, collected or
otherwise disposed of, or until the investment is determined to be impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously
reported in Equity is included in the line “Unusual items” of the Income statement. Call and put options on shares of non-consolidated
companies (derivatives held for trading) are accounted for at fair value in the lines other receivables or other payables of the Balance
sheet. Changes in the fair value are entered in the line Unusual items of the Income statement.

Financial assets at fair value through the profit or loss are acquired for the purpose of generating a profit from short-term
fluctuations in price.

In Lecta Group, investments at fair value through the profit or loss are money market funds used to invest safely temporary excess
of Cash. They are included in the line “Cash and cash equivalents”, in the Current assets of the Balance sheet. After initial recognition,
they are measured at fair value. Gains or losses are recognized in the line “Finance costs” of the Income statement.

Held-to-maturity investments are acquired with the intent to be held to their fixed maturity (e.g. bonds). Lecta Group holds no such
investment. Held-to-maturity investments are included in the line “Other non-current assets”, in the Non-current assets of the Balance
sheet. After initial recognition, they are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method. Amortized cost is
calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition, over the period to maturity. Gains and losses are recognized
in the line “Finance costs” of the Income statement when the investments are derecognized or impaired, as well as through the
amortization process.

Loans and receivables originated by the enterprise are created by providing money, goods or services directly to a debtor, other
than those that are originated with the intent to be sold immediately or in the short term. In Lecta Group, financial investments
originated by the enterprise are as follows:

—  deposits,

—  guarantees,

—  loans to non-consolidated companies or third parties.

They are included in the line “Other non-current assets”, in the Non-current assets of the Balance sheet. After initial recognition,
they are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method. Amortized cost is calculated by taking into account any
discount or premium on acquisition, over the period to maturity. Gains and losses are recognized in the line “Unusual items” of the
Income statement when the investments are derecognized or impaired, as well as through the amortization process.

Determination of fair values

For investments that are actively traded in organized financial markets, fair value is determined by reference to Stock Exchange
quoted market bid prices at the close of business on the Balance sheet date.

For investments where there is no quoted market price, fair value is determined by reference to the current market value of another
instrument, which is substantially the same or is calculated based on the expected cash flows of the underlying net asset base of the
investment. If these elements are not available, the initial cost is kept until better information is available.

233


-----

Date of recognition

All sales and purchases of financial assets are recognized using the settlement date i.e. the date the asset is delivered to or received
from the counter-party. Qualify in this category all sales or purchases of financial assets that require delivery of assets within the
timeframe generally established by regulation or convention in the market place.

**1.18. Biological assets**

In Lecta Group, biological assets are limited to standing timber. The latter is exclusively dedicated to internal consumption, for the
production of pulp. It is shown in the line “Biological assets”, in the Non-current assets of the Balance sheet. It is measured at fair
value.

**1.19. Impairment of long-lived assets**

Property, plant and equipment, Investment properties, Other intangible assets, Investment in associates, Available-for-sale
investments and Biological assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value
may not be recoverable. This review is done each year for the Goodwill. Where the carrying values exceed the estimated recoverable
amount, the asset or the associated cash-generating unit is written down to its recoverable amount.

The recoverable amount is the greater of net selling price and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash
flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of
money and the risks specific to the asset. For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount
is determined for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.

Impairment losses are recognized in the line “Unusual items” of the Income statement.

**1.20. Inventories**

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost includes materials, direct labor and an attributable
proportion of manufacturing overheads based on normal levels of activity. Cost is computed according to the weighted average cost
method. Net realizable value is based on estimated selling price, less further costs expected to be incurred to completion and disposal.
Given the lack of meaningful market references, the inventoried spare parts are impaired in accordance with slow moving rules
reflecting their obsolescence.

**1.21. Trade receivables**

They are recognized and carried at original invoice amount less an allowance for any uncollectable amounts. An estimate for
doubtful debts is made when collection of part or all of a receivable is no longer probable. Bad debts are written off when identified.
From time to time, Lecta Group assigns trade receivables to financial institutions through non-recourse agreements. If Lecta Group
has a residual commitment in the transferred assets, this liability is accounted for using the continuous involvement approach: the net
amount of this financial liability and the related financial asset is equal to the fair value of the rights and obligations retained.

**1.22. Prepayments**

This heading comprises payments to trade or other payables for future benefits such as insurance premiums. They are stated at
their nominal value.

**1.23. Other receivables**

This heading comprises:

—  loans,

—  deposits and guarantees,

234


-----

—  grants receivables,

—  capital receivables on the sale of long-lived assets,

—  Shareholders receivables (e.g. on capital increase),

—  dividends receivables,

—  favorable options on non-consolidated companies,

—  favorable interest rate hedging,

—  miscellaneous other receivables (e.g. expected reimbursement through an insurance contract).

**1.24. Cash and cash equivalents**

This heading comprises:

—  cash in hand,

—  cash in banks’ current accounts,

—  short-term deposits and certificates of deposit with an original maturity of three months or less,

—  marketable securities (Government bonds, Treasury bills and similar short-term securities).

Any gains and losses on Cash and cash equivalents are taken to the Income statement, in the line “Finance costs”.

Note: In the Cash flow statement, the analysis is focused on variation of Cash and cash equivalents net of Bank overdrafts.

**1.25. Interest-bearing borrowings and Bank overdrafts**

All borrowings are initially recognized at cost, being the fair value of the consideration received net of issue cost associated with
the borrowings. After initial recognition, they are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method. Amortized cost
is calculated by taking into account any issue costs and any discount or premium on settlement. Gains or losses are recognized in the
line “Finance costs” of the Income statement, when the liabilities are derecognized or impaired, as well as through the amortization
process.

Lecta Group doesn’t capitalize any borrowing cost in the long-lived assets.

**1.26. Grants**

Grants constitute deferred income related to Property, plant & equipment. Grants are recognized at their fair value and released in
the line “Depreciation” of the Income statement, over the expected useful life of the relevant asset, on a straight-line basis.

**1.27. Provisions**

Provisions are recognized when:

—  Lecta Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event; and

—  It is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation; and

235


-----

—  A reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.

Where Lecta Group expects the impact of a provision to be neutralized, for example under an insurance contract, a separate asset is
recognized when it is virtually certain.

If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a
pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the
liability. Where discounting is used, the change of the provision due to the time value of money is recognized in the line “Finance
costs” of the Income statement.

**1.28. Employee benefits**

Lecta Group’s employees take advantage of various benefits schemes:

—  Short-term employee benefits:

These include wages, salaries, paid holidays, social contributions, sick leave, compensated absences, bonuses, profit sharing and
non-monetary benefits, all paid within 12 months after service is rendered.

—  Defined contribution post-employment plans:

The cost to the employer is fixed and predictable. The charge for the period is the contribution due in respect of the service
rendered during the period. Payments in advance are in the line “Prepayments” of the Balance sheet. Payments in arrears are in the
line “Trade payables” of the Balance sheet. Any accrual that does not fall due within 12 months beyond Balance sheet date is
discounted to present value.

—  Defined benefit post-employment plans:

The employer retains a risk of additional contributions to be paid. The plan is valued in the Balance sheet at the present value of
the obligation less the fair value of any plan assets legally separate from the employer. For any unrecognized past service costs, if
the changed benefits vest immediately it is immediately recognized, otherwise it is amortized over the vesting period. All actuarial
gains or losses are immediately recognized (see . For any curtailment or settlement, the resulting change is immediately
recognized.

—  Other long-term benefits:

These include long-service or jubilee benefits.

All actuarial gains or losses and any past service costs are immediately recognized.

—  Termination benefits:

These include early retirement schemes or redundancy programs. They are recognized as a liability and an expense when and only
when a company of Lecta group is demonstrably committed to terminate the employment of a group of employees before the normal
retirement date or provide termination benefits as a result of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy.

Lecta Group employees do not benefit from Equity compensation benefits plan or share based payments plan.

The employee benefits may be funded, resulting in a debt obligation with financial institutions, or unfunded, resulting in the
booking of a provision. Independent qualified actuaries review any material long-term obligation of Lecta Group.

The costs are accounted for as follows:

—  The actuarial gains and losses are directly recognized in the line “Net unrealized gains (losses)” of the Equity.

236


-----

—  All the other costs are recognized in the Income statement, in the following lines:

—  Costs related to active employees: “Labor costs”.

—  Costs related to retired people: “Other operating costs except unusual items”.

—  Costs due to the time value of money: “Finance costs”.

**1.29. Income tax payable**

Income tax payable includes withholding taxes.

**1.30. Deferred income tax**

Deferred income tax is provided, using the liability method, on all temporary differences at the Balance sheet date between the tax
bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes, except where the temporary difference will
not reverse in the foreseeable future. Furthermore, deferred income tax assets are recognized for deferred deductibility of expenses
(e.g. employee benefits paid to financial institutions for which the deductibility is deferred), carry-forward of unused tax assets and
unused tax losses to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available to use these assets. Deferred income tax assets
and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realized or the liability settled,
based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the Balance sheet date. Deferred income tax
relating to items recognized directly in equity is recognized in equity and not in the income statement.

**1.31. Trade payables**

This heading comprises:

—  trade payables,

—  employees and social charges,

—  VAT and other taxes except Income tax,

—  any accruals on the above.

**1.32. Other payables**

This heading comprises:

—  capital payables following the purchase of long-lived assets,

—  Shareholders payables (e.g. on capital redemption),

—  dividends payables,

—  options on Minorities of consolidated companies,

—  unfavorable options on non-consolidated companies,

—  unfavorable interest rate hedging,

—  miscellaneous other payables (unusual items).

237


-----

Options on Minorities of consolidated companies are Equity derivatives:

A premium paid or received on equity derivatives at inception is recorded in Equity in a specific line “Equity derivatives”. Up to
now, Lecta Group didn’t pay such premiums.

Discounted value of exercise price of a sold option or a firm commitment, at inception and at each year-end, is recorded in the line
Other payables against the line Minority interests.

When the sold option or the firm commitment is exercised, the amount in Other payables is reversed against Cash, and the
remaining balances of Minority interests and Equity derivatives are reversed against Goodwill. If it is a negative goodwill, it is
immediately written off against a profit in the line Unusual items of the Income statement.

**1.33. Derivative hedging instruments**

Lecta Group uses derivative instruments to hedge foreign currency and interest rates fluctuations. Such derivative instruments are
stated at their fair values as communicated by the financial institutions counterpart to these transactions.

For accounting purposes, derivative instruments are classified in three categories as follows:

—  Fair value hedges: to cover the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability. In Lecta Group, these
are forward agreements on realized sales and purchases in non-euro currencies. Any gain or loss from re-measuring the
hedging instrument at fair value is recognized in the line “Other operating costs except unusual items” of the Income statement
against Trade receivables or Trade payables.

—  Cash flow hedges: to cover the exposure to variability in cash flows that is attributable to a particular risk associated with a
forecast transaction. In Lecta Group, these could be interest rate and/or exchange rate swaps, caps, floors, collars, options. The
portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognized directly in the
line “Net unrealized gains (losses)” in the Equity against Other receivables or Other payables. It is removed from Equity to the
line “Finance costs” of the Income statement when the hedged item affects the Income statement. The ineffective portion of
gain or loss is immediately recognized in the line “Finance costs” of the Income statement.

—  Hedges of net investments in foreign entities expressed in a non-euro currency:

In Lecta Group, there is no such instrument.

The accounting treatment is the same as for Cash flow hedges.

**3. Significant events**

**3.1. First Time Adoption of the IFRSs**

**_3.1.1. Overview_**

On 1 January 2005, Lecta Group adopted for the first time the IFRSs. Previously Lecta prepared its accounts in accordance with
French GAAP formalized in Regulation 99-02 approved by decree dated 22 June 1999 of the “Comité de Réglementation Comptable”,
the French accounting regulation commission.

The specific treatment for IAS32, Financial Instruments: Disclosures and presentation, and IAS 39, Financial instruments:
Recognition and Measurement, is explained in Note 3.2.

In the next pages, the following statements are presented:

—  Reconciliation of the Balance sheets at 1 January 2004. This is the date of transition to IFRS.

—  Reconciliation of the Income statements for the year 2004.

—  Reconciliation of the Balance sheets at 31 December 2004.

—  Reconciliation of the Cash flow statements for the year 2004. 2004 is the last year where the financial statements were shown
under previous GAAP.

Rules followed on the reconciliation statements:

242


-----

—  Priority has been given to the formats under IFRS.

—  Columns under the previous GAAP show figures as they can be found in the Annual report of Lecta Group at 31 December
2004, either in the main statements or in the notes.

—  When the designation of a line under the previous GAAP significantly differs from the one under IFRS or if the line has no
equivalent under IFRS, the old designation has been added in italic.

—  In the two reconciliations of the Balance sheets and in the reconciliation of the Income statements, the simple reclassifications
from one line to another and the changes that have an impact in the equity are shown in two different columns.

—  The reconciliation of the Cash flow statements is only a matter of reclassifications from one line to another. These
reclassifications have been reported in two columns: one column for the changes that are a direct consequence of the
adjustments made in the Balance sheets or in the Income statement and the other column for the changes that are specific to the
Cash flow statement.

—  Detailed comments are available in the pages following the statements.

**_3.1.3. Changes that have an impact on equity_**

(a) Revaluation of Property, plant and equipment:

At 1 January 2004 only the Property, plant and equipment of Cartiere del Garda SpA were revaluated from 120,863 under previous
GAAP to 165,803. In the 2004 Income statement, this created differences in Depreciation and in Unusual items (net book value of
disposals).

**Balance sheet** **1 Jan 2004** **31 Dec 2004**
**(in EUR K)**
Property, plant and equipment.... +44,939 +41,568

**Income statement** **Year 2004**
Depreciation ...... (3,844)
Unusual items.... +472
Total .................. (3,372)

(b) Goodwill.

Under the previous GAAP, the Goodwill on acquired subsidiaries (positive as well as negative) was identified and amortized.
There was also a “Transaction goodwill”, consequence of the merger at the origin of Cartiere del Garda SpA in 1997, that was in
Other intangible assets. In 2004, the positive and negative Goodwills bore amortizations of (10,826) and +1,521. The net of (9,305)
was reported in a specific line of the Income statement, “Amortization of Goodwill”. The “Transaction goodwill” bore an amortization
of (965) in “Amortization _of Other intangible assets”. Under IFRS, the positive Goodwill is not amortized anymore. The negative_
Goodwill is immediately accounted for as an income. The “Transaction goodwill” is part of the positive Goodwill, see comment (o).

**Balance sheet** **1 Jan 2004** **31 Dec 2004**
**(in EUR K)**
Goodwill...... +17,236 +27,507

**Income statement** **Year 2004**
Amortization of Other intangible assets ..... +965
_Amortization of Goodwill............................_ +9,305
Total............................................................ +10,270

(c) Acquisition costs.

Under the previous GAAP, _Acquisitions costs_ consisted in charges to be spread over several years. They were capitalized and
amortized in a specific line of the Balance sheet and of the Income statement. In 2004, nothing was capitalized and (6,671) were
amortized. Under IFRS, such costs are expensed as incurred.

**Balance sheet** **1 Jan 2004** **31 Dec 2004**
**(in EUR K)**
_Acquisition costs..._ (11,866) (5,195)

**Income statement** **Year 2004**
_Amortization of Acquisition costs...._ +6,671

(d) Start-up expenses.

Under the previous GAAP, _Start-up expenses_ consisted in the costs associated to the learning curve of new tangible assets
(inefficiency), a capital increase or changes in the articles of association of a consolidated subsidiary. They were capitalized and
amortized as part of the Other intangible assets. In 2004, 313 were capitalized and (2,362) were amortized. Under IFRS, such costs are
expensed as incurred.

**Balance sheet** **1 Jan 2004** **31 Dec 2004**
**(in EUR K)**
Other intangible assets.... (6,590) (4,541)

Total................................................................. +2,049

**Cash flow statement** **Year 2004**
EBITDA........................... (313)
Purchase of other assets ... +313

(e) Durations of depreciation.

The durations of depreciation were reviewed in Condat SA and Torraspapel Group. In the 2004 Income statement, this created
differences in Depreciation and in Unusual items (net book value of disposals).

**Balance sheet** **1 Jan 2004** **31 Dec 2004**
**(in EUR K)**
Property, plant and equipment.... +37 +424

**Income statement** **Year 2004**
Depreciation ...... +13
Unusual items.... +374
Total .................. +387

(f) Private subsidies.

In Lecta Group, a private subsidy is related to a piece of equipment dedicated to a specific raw material or an other supply (e.g.
starch). This piece of equipment is payable by installment, but at each installment time, the supplier sends a credit note. Under
previous GAAP, the private subsidies were considered as Grants (in Other payables). Under IFRS, each time a credit note is received
from the supplier, it is considered as a reduction of the cost of raw materials, while the piece of equipment is depreciated by the same
amount.

**Balance sheet** **1 Jan 2004** **31 Dec 2004**
**(in EUR K)**
Property, plant and equipment.... (1,002) (1,143)

-----

(g) Inventories.

The revaluation of Property, plant and equipment mentioned in comment (a) caused an increase in the valuation of inventories, as
there is more depreciation.

**Balance sheet** **1 Jan 2004** **31 Dec 2004**
**(in EUR K)**
Inventories... 0 +332

**Income statement** **Year 2004**
Changes in inventories of finished goods and work in
process............................................................................... +332

**Cash flow statement** **Year 2004**
EBITDA ...................................... +332
Inventories decrease (increase).... (332)

(h) Loans CILEM.

CILEM loans are compulsory interest-free loans in support of social housing in France. They are reimbursable in one installment
after 20 years. In 2004, Condat SA elected to use the alternative option of converting these loans into immediately tax-deductible
subsidies. Under previous GAAP, the impact was a charge in the Income statement of 2004. Under IFRS, the opening balance was
changed.

**Balance sheet** **1 Jan 2004** **31 Dec 2004**
**(in EUR K)**
Other non-current receivables ... (1,305) 0

**Income statement** **Year 2004**
Unusual items.... +1,305

(i) Capitalization of Overhaul.

The previous GAAP required an accounting change to be implemented in 2004. The maintenance costs of overhaul were
capitalized and depreciated. It impacted the Income statement of 2004, generating a reduction of maintenance costs of +520 and an
additional depreciation of (350). Under IFRS, the opening balance was changed.

**Balance sheet** **1 Jan 2004** **31 Dec 2004**
**(in EUR K)**
Property, plant and equipment.... +170 0

**Income statement** **Year 2004**
Other operating costs except unusual items..... (520)
Depreciation..................................................... +350
Total................................................................. (170)

**Cash flow statement** **Year 2004**
EBITDA .......................................................... (520)
Purchase of Property, plant and equipment ..... +520

253


-----

(j) Deferred tax.

There were deferred tax impacts on the above items except on Goodwill (but on “Transaction goodwill”) and for companies where
no deferred tax can be accounted for.

**Balance sheet** **1 Jan 2004** **31 Dec 2004**
**(in EUR K)**
Deferred income tax assets ......... +5,844 +2,772
Deferred income tax liabilities.... +16,815 +15,756
Total............................................ (10,971) (12,983)

**Income statement** **Year 2004**
Income tax......... (2,013)

(k) The net impact of all the above items was as follows:

**Balance sheet** **1 Jan 2004** **31 Dec 2004**
**(in EUR K)**
Equity holders of the parent.... +31,750 +47,099
Minority interest...................... +4 +221

Equity holders of the parent .... +15,348
Minority interest...................... +217
Profit (loss) after tax................ +15,566

**_3.1.4. Reclassifications that have no impact on equity_**

**_Year 2005_**

(1) Impact of local rates:

—  The local statutory tax rates (actual and deferred) were all higher than the Luxembourg actual nominal tax rate. Applied to the
sum of locally computed taxable earnings, positive in 2005, it generated an unfavorable impact of EUR (2,369) K.

—  The French applicable deferred tax rate decreased in 2005. It led to an unfavorable decrease of the net deferred tax asset on 1
January 2005 of EUR (8) K.

(2) Adjustments on usable losses:

—  Tax losses of Dispap SA (Spain), Torraspapel Lda (Portugal), Torraspapel France Sàrl (France) and Torraspapel Argentina SA
(Argentina), were used in 2005. Since they were not previously recorded as deferred tax assets, there was a favorable impact of
EUR 399 K.

—  Some tax losses of 2005, in Luxembourg holdings, Torraspapel Ltd (United Kingdom) and Torras Papier GmbH (Germany)
didn’t lead to the recognition of deferred tax assets, resulting in an unfavorable impact of EUR (174) K.

(3) Permanent differences on tax bases:

—  Some intragroup dividends paid between Spanish subsidiaries borne a withholding tax. It resulted in an unfavorable impact of
EUR (573) K.

—  Definitively non-deductible charges resulted in an unfavorable impact of EUR (474) K.

—  Some temporary differences didn’t lead to the recognition of deferred tax assets because of the weak probability of recovery.
In 2005, the net movement of such items was an increase of provision. It resulted in an unfavorable impact of EUR (655) K.

(4) Other adjustments:

—  The IRAP (“Imposta Regionale sulle Attivita Produttive”) was computed on a larger base than the taxable earnings in Italy,
leading to an unfavorable impact of EUR (1,430) K.

—  Some miscellaneous adjustments, mostly on prior years generated a net favorable impact of EUR 166 K.

**_Year 2004_**

(1) Impact of local rates:

Note: Lecta Group has no intangible asset with indefinite life.

**Impairment testing of Goodwill:**

The Goodwill has been allocated to three cash-generating units that are the geographical divisions based on location of industrial
assets, Italy, France and Spain.

The recoverable amounts of these cash-generating units have been determined based on values-in-use calculation. This was
produced based upon 2006 to 2009 cash flow projections part of the Lecta financial plan, as approved by Lecta Group Management.
As already mentioned in Note 1.01, Management of Lecta Group made assumptions for the years to come. The cash flows beyond
2009 are extrapolated being equal to those in the year 2009. The pre-tax discount rate applied to cash flow projections is 12.3%.

The origin of the Goodwill and their allocation to the cash-generating units are explained hereunder.

—  On 13 November 1998, Condat Holding SA acquired the entire share capital of Condat SA for EUR 142.8 M. The historical
Goodwill amounting to EUR 87.9 M was amortized over 20 years until 1 January 2004, date of transition to IFRS. At that date,
the cumulated amortization was EUR (22.7) M. The net amount of 65.2 M was allocated to the unit France.

270


-----

—  On 13 December 1999 the entire share capital but one share of Sub Lecta 1 SA was contributed to Lecta SA for EUR 151.9 M.
The Goodwill amounting to EUR 102.9 M was amortized over 20 years until 1 January 2004, date of transition to IFRS. At that
date, the cumulated amortization was EUR (21.0) M. The net amount of EUR 81.9 M was globally related to the whole subgroup held by Sub Lecta 1 SA. Lecta Group Management considers that there is no economical way to split this Goodwill
between the two industrial companies of this sub-group, Cartiere del Garda SpA and Condat SA. Nevertheless, for the sake of
impairment testing only, Management let this Goodwill arbitrarily allocated to the unit Italy. This decision has no impact on
the result of the test anyway.

—  On 13 December 1999 the entire share capital but one share of Sub Lecta 2 SA was contributed to Lecta SA for EUR 51.1 M.
The Goodwill amounting to EUR 14 K was amortized over 20 years until 1 January 2004, date of transition to IFRS. At that
date, the cumulated amortization was EUR (3) K. The net amount of EUR 11 K was allocated to the unit Spain.

—  On 14 December 1999, Torraspapel Holding SA (previously Nueva Organización SA) acquired 95.0486% of the share capital
of Torraspapel SA for EUR 315.9 M. The Goodwill amounting to EUR 11.3 M was written-off at 31 December 2001
simultaneously to the recognition of pre-acquisition tax losses. On 30 October 2002, following a reduction of the acquisition
price of Torraspapel SA of EUR (19.0) M a Badwill of the same amount was booked. It was amortized over 13 years until 1
January 2004, date of transition to IFRS. At that date, the cumulated amortization was EUR 1.8 M. The net amount of EUR
(17.2) M was fully eliminated against Equity.

—  In 2002, a correction was made to the acquisition balance of Cartiere del Garda SpA. Therefore, a Goodwill of EUR 25.7 M
was booked. It was amortized over 20 years starting back from the acquisition of this company, 02.10.1997. This amortization
was frozen at 1 January 2004, date of transition to IFRS. At that date, the cumulated amortization was EUR (8.0) M. The net
amount of EUR 17.7 M was allocated to the unit Italy.

—  A merger took effect under Italian law on 1 August 1997, of which Cartiere del Garda SpA was the surviving entity. As a
consequence, Transaction goodwill of EUR 96.8 M, to be amortized over 10 years, was recorded. On 2 October 1997, Sub
Lecta 1 SA acquired Cartiere del Garda SpA. In view of the Lecta Group accounting policy, the tangible assets were revalued
at their market value according to an external appraisal and the value of inventories was adjusted on 30 June 1998, date of the
first consolidation of the Cartiere del Garda Group. The counterpart to this revaluation of EUR 77.5 M was subtracted from
Transaction Goodwill. Its residual value of EUR 19.3 M was amortized over 20 years until 1 January 2004, date of transition to
IFRS. At that date the cumulated amortization was EUR (5.3) M. This Transaction goodwill was transferred from Intangible
assets to Goodwill. The net amount of EUR 14.0 M was allocated to the unit Italy.

As a whole, the Goodwill was allocated as follows:

Italy..... EUR 113.6 M
France. EUR 65.2 M
Spain... EUR 11 K
Total.... EUR 178.8 M

The impairment test was successfully passed and no impairment was accounted for.

Cartiere del Garda SpA generated tax losses in 2004 and 2005. At 31 December 2005, the total of deferred tax on loss to be carried
forward was EUR 16,447 K of which EUR 13,995 K have to be used before 31 December 2009 and EUR 3,051 K before 31
December 2010. Management, in view of the plan, considers that the tax losses will be used against taxable profits within a few years
and in any case before the above limit.

The impact of deductible legal revaluation in Italy, which applied in Cartiere del Garda SpA, was an asset on 31 December 2004
and a liability on 31 December 2005. This is due to the combination of local tax rules and of the tax loss situation of the company.

The new lines in 2005, Unrealized losses and gains through Equity, are a consequence of the introduction of IAS 32 & 39 and of
the early adoption of IAS 19 (see Note 1.02).

At 31 December 2005, the Income tax rates used for Deferred tax purposes were as follows:

**Country** **Rate**
Argentina 35%
France 33.33% to 34.43%
Germany 35.78%
Italy 33% (IRPEG)
+ 4.25% (IRAP)
Luxembourg 29.63%
Mexico 29%

281

Morocco 35%
Portugal 27.5%
Spain 35%
UK 30%

**35.2. Key management personnel compensation**

Lecta group decided not to provide the detail of the above compensation as it would breach the confidentiality restrictions on this
matter.

**35.3. Other related parties**

Nothing to mention.

**36. Financial risk management objectives and policies**

Lecta undertook a risk mapping exercise encompassing all business areas. The Board of Directors reviewed the information
collected.

Currency risk on transactions:

Lecta Group covers the fluctuations of non-euro currencies, mainly USD, GBP and CAD, according to the following rules:

—  Balance sheet approach for trade receivables and payables: on a regular basis, the actual sales and purchases expressed in noneuro currencies are covered through forward agreements with fixed expiry dates consistent with those of the hedged items.

—  Income statement approach for forecast income and expenses: on an occasional basis, a part of the future sales and purchases
to be made in non-euro currencies may be covered through forward agreements or options for a maximum period of six
months.

Consequently, the profit of Lecta is exposed to the fluctuations of non-euro currencies on future sales and purchases. The
sensitivity to such fluctuations is provided in Note 37.4.

Currency risk on investments:

Lecta Group has no significant investments in the non-euro zone.

Currency risk on Borrowings:

The borrowings of Lecta Group are essentially expressed in euro.

Interest rate risk:

Interest on a part of the Borrowings of Lecta Group is indexed to Euribor and hedged in order to reduce the impact of interest rate
fluctuations (see Note 37.3). The counterparts are only leading financial institutions that have a credit rating equal to or better than
A1+/P1 short-term or AA—/Aa3 long-term ratings.

Market risk:

Lecta Group profit is affected by cyclical changes in the overall economic activity. Also, Lecta Group is exposed to variations in
the price of raw materials and energy.

To reduce their impacts:

—  Lecta Group customer base is highly diversified in terms of geography and channels of sales.

—  Lecta Group produces part of its needs of pulp, the main raw material used in the production of paper. It also produces part of
its energy requirement.

-----

Customer credit risk:

Lecta Group strictly monitors the customer credit risk. Credit insurance covers a large part of the Trade receivables.

Business risk:

Lecta Group negotiates insurance policies for major risks, such as property damage & business interruption and general liability.
Lecta Group also invests in the prevention and the protection of its assets following the recommendations by leading insurance
companies.

Financial credit risk, liquidity risk and cash flow risk:

The major part of the Lecta Group borrowings is senior debt contracted with a syndicate of lenders. It ensures both long-term
financing and operating flexibility, as long as Lecta Group abides by some covenants that are commonly used in such contracts (see
Note 26).

**37. Financial instruments**

**37.1. Equity derivatives**

These are options on the minorities of consolidated companies.

**_37.1.1. Agreement for Sold put and Purchased call options on the shares of Torraspapel SA._**

Torraspapel Holding SA currently holds 95.05% of the shares of Torraspapel SA. The agreement relates to the 2.50% of shares in
Torraspapel SA owned by Grupo Torras SA and any part of the remaining 2.45% held by other minority shareholders that Grupo
Torras SA might acquire. The possibility to exercise these options is dependent on the occurrence of certain future events that are not
foreseen to take place in the near future. There was no premium paid at inception. At 1 January 2005, the discounted value of the
exercise price, EUR 7.2 M, was accounted for the first time. It was lower than the net book value, EUR 14.4 M, of the shares object of
the agreement. At 31 December 2005, the discounted value was EUR 6.8 M.

**_37.1.2. Purchased call option on the shares of Cogeneración Motril SA._**

The current shareholders of Cogeneración Motril SA are:

—  Torraspapel SA:..................................................................... 51%
—  Sociedad Inversora en Energia y Medio Ambiente, SA
(SIEMA)................................................................................ 39%
—  La Energia SA:...................................................................... 10%

If the option was exercised, Torraspapel would acquire 24% from SIEMA. This could only take place between 2014 and 2018. At
31 December 2005, the discounted value of the exercise price of the option was EUR 4.4 M. The likelihood for the conditions in the
option to be met was considered as remote. Furthermore, the exercise price was considered as above the fair value of the shares.
Therefore, nothing was entered in the balance sheet.

**37.2. Derivatives held for trading**

These are options on the shares or on the assets of non-consolidated companies.

295


-----

**_37.2.1. Sold put and Purchased call options agreement on the shares of Condat UK Ltd._**

The current shareholders of Condat UK Ltd are:

—  Condat SA: 51%
—  HH Peggs Ltd: 49%

If the options were exercised, Condat SA would acquire the remaining 49%. At 31 December 2005, the exercise price of the option
was EUR 1.5 M. This price was considered as close to its fair value. Therefore, nothing was entered in the balance sheet.

**_37.2.2. Sold put and Purchased call options agreement on the shares of Cogeneración del Ter SL._**

The current shareholders of Cogeneración del Ter SL are:

—  Endesa Cogeneración y Renovables
SAU: 69%
—  La Energia SA: 30%
—  Torraspapel SA: 1%

If the option was exercised, Torraspapel SA would acquire 74%, 49% from Endesa and 25% from La Energia. At 31 December
2005, the exercise price of the option was EUR 0.01 M. The likelihood for the conditions in the agreement to be met was considered
as remote. Therefore, nothing was entered in the balance sheet.

**_37.2.3. Purchased call option agreement on the shares of SVL Pilote Sàrl._**

The current shareholder of SVL Pilote Sàrl is:

—  Private owner: 100%

If the option was exercised, Condat SA would acquire up to 100% of the shares. At 31 December 2005, the exercise price of the
option was EUR 1.1 M. This price was considered as higher or equal to the fair value of the company. Therefore, nothing was entered
in the balance sheet.

**_37.2.4. Purchased call option agreement on the shares or assets of Périgord Énergies SNC._**

The current shareholders of Périgord Énergies SNC is:

—  Elyo Midi Ocean SA: 100%

There is a contract between Elyo Midi Ocean SA and Condat SA for the supply of steam (see Note 33.4.2). At the end of this 12
year contract, i.e. on 31 March 2013, Condat SA has the option to purchase 100% of the assets of Périgord Énergies SNC for a price
of EUR 6.6 M. A clause specifies that an overhaul of the assets will be performed and billed to Condat SA before the acquisition. At
31 December 2005, the total price was considered as higher or equal to the probable fair value of the equipments after the overhaul.
Therefore, nothing was entered in the balance sheet. The contract also provides for a clause of early termination. Nevertheless, the
likelihood for the conditions in the agreement to be met was considered as remote. Therefore, nothing was entered in the balance
sheet.

**37.3. Hedging derivatives on interest rates**

The interest rates of a part of the Senior debt have been hedged according to the following Euribor 3 months Collars:

**Fair value at**
**31 December 2005**
**Notional** **Effective** **Termination**
**amount** **date** **date** **Floor rate** **Cap rate** **Intrinsic** **Time** **Total**
**(in EUR K)**
310,000 . 31.03.2003 30.06.2006 3.500% 5.000% (1,370) (9) (1,379)
200,000 . 31.03.2003 30.06.2006 3.570% 5.000% (971) 0 (971)
200,000 . 31.03.2003 30.06.2006 3.820% 5.000% (1,214) 0 (1,214)
710,000 . (3,555) (9) (3,565)

On 31 December 2005, the Euribor 3 months was 2.492%. Since it was below the floors, there is a potential additional cost on
future interest. The value of the collars at 31 December 2005 was computed by the banks that granted them. Negative values express
amounts in favor of the banks.

These values have been accounted for as cash flow hedging. Intrinsic values, considered as effective, are recognized directly in
Equity while time values, considered as ineffective, are recognized in the Income statement. As the termination date of these collars is
30 June 2006, all the cash flows are expected to occur no later than this date.

**37.4. Hedging derivatives on foreign currencies**

The Lecta Group operations are impacted by the fluctuations of the non-euro currencies, mainly USD, CAD and GBP. Sales and
purchases are specifically hedged trough:

—  Forward agreements on realized sales in foreign currencies: EUR 41.6 M.

—  Forward agreements on realized purchases in foreign currencies: EUR 47.4 M.

—  Options on future sales in foreign currencies: EUR 16.1 M.

The impact of these contracts has been accounted for as fair value hedging, hence recognized in the Income statement.

The profit of Lecta is exposed to the fluctuations of non-euro currencies on future sales and purchases. Favorable (unfavorable)
impact on EBITDA of a decrease of 0.01 of exchange rate (e.g. for USD/EUR from 1.19 to 1.18), all things being equal, based on
actual figures of 2005.

There is no change from 31 December 2005.

**3. Significant events**

**3.1. Sale of non-industrial properties**

Torraspapel SA is currently undertaking the sale of non-industrial properties. On 30 September 2006, the impact on the accounts
of Lecta Group was as follows:

—  A part of the assets was already sold, resulting in a net gain of EUR 3,204 K in the line “Unusual items” of the Income
statement.

—  A part of the assets is in a firm process to be sold. Payments in advance of EUR 3,201 K were received in July 2006. In
application of IFRS 5, the net book value of EUR 9,336 K was transferred in the line “Non-current assets held for sale” of the
Balance sheet and not depreciated anymore as of 31 July 2006.

—  Expenses of offices grouping, linked to this program, were also entered in the line “Unusual items” of the Income statement:
EUR 610 K.

**3.2. Recognition of a deferred tax asset on unused tax losses**

Sub Lecta 1 SA has the ability to generate taxable profits as from the fiscal year 2006. It led to the accounting for deferred tax
assets on tax losses to be carried forward. The amount of available tax losses on 31 December 2005 was EUR 66,942 K that translates
in a deferred tax income of EUR 19,835 K, the current rate in the Grand duchy of Luxembourg being 29.63%.

EUR 22,513 K out of these tax losses were already part of the unused tax losses of Sub Lecta 1 SA on 13 December 1999 when its
shares were contributed to Lecta SA.

The tax rate at the time of this acquisition was 37.45%. If these tax losses had been immediately recognized, the Goodwill would
have been reduced by an initial amount of EUR 8,431 K. This Goodwill was amortized before the adoption of IFRS by Lecta Group.
Therefore, this initial amount has been reduced in the same proportion. Finally, EUR 6,710 K of the Goodwill were released, in
compliance with the paragraph 68 of IAS 12 (revised 2000) “Income taxes”, causing a charge by the same amount in the line Unusual
items of the Income statement.

**4. Information by Segment**

The IAS 14 “Segment reporting” (paragraph 3) applies to listed companies. Lecta being privately held has elected not to
communicate this information.
