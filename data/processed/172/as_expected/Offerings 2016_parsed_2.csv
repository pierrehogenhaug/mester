By their nature, forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in the future. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and our actual results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and the development of the industry in which we operate, may differ materially from those made in or suggested by the forward-looking statements contained in this Offering Memorandum. You should not place undue reliance on these forward looking statements.

In particular, you should place no reliance on statements we make with respect to estimates, expectations or projections regarding sales volume or synergies expected from acquisitions we have made or may undertake. Important factors that could cause those differences include, but are not limited to: - difficulty to accurately forecast customer demand; - industry conditions, including cyclicality in the prices of our products and the raw materials used to make them, competition and production capacity; - global economic conditions and political events; - the United Kingdom’s recent referendum on membership in the European Union and the results of implementing that referendum; - changing customer preferences or the development of new technologies; - substitution towards digital media and changes in consumer preferences; - the highly competitive nature of our industry; - our reliance on a limited number of customer accounts for a significant amount of our revenue; - our ability to generate sufficient cash to satisfy our commitments and fund our capital expenditures; - risks related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates; - risks related to current and future acquisitions; - our ability to realize cost reductions and efficiency improvements; - the cost of compliance with environmental health and safety and other laws and regulations; - changes in energy regulation; - costs and liability associated with hazardous substances at certain of our facilities; - effects of climate change; - the possibility of major disruptions in production at our facilities, including risks associated with our labor relations; - changes in regulation of pension liabilities and other employment obligations; - the supervision of public administrative authorities; - our limited insurance coverage; - a fire or other accident at our facilities; - certifications by industry standard-setting bodies; - our ability to retain key employees; v ----- - other risks and uncertainties inherent to our business and to general local and global economic conditions; - the consequences of our substantial indebtedness; - risks related to the Collateral; - risks related to our structure; and - other factors discussed under ‘‘Risk Factors’’, ‘‘Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests’’ and elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

Other sections of this Offering Memorandum describe additional factors that could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and the development of the sectors in which we operate. New risks can emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all such risks, nor can we assess the impact of all such risks on our business or the extent to which any risks, or combination of risks and other factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, you should not rely on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or publicly revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

The financial information included in this Offering Memorandum is not intended to comply with the SEC reporting requirements. Compliance with such requirements would require the presentation of financial information in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (‘‘U.S. GAAP’’) or in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (‘‘IFRS-IASB’’), as the case may be, the modification or exclusion of certain information presented in this Offering Memorandum and the presentation of certain other information not included in this Offering Memorandum including pro forma financial information for a material disposition. In addition, IFRS-EU, IFRS-IASB and U.S. GAAP may differ in certain significant respects from each other. This Offering Memorandum does not include any reconciliation of the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements or the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Information from IFRS-EU to IFRS-IASB or U.S. GAAP. It is possible that a reconciliation or other qualitative or quantitative analysis would identify material differences between the financial information presented herein in accordance with IFRS-EU and other financial information prepared under IFRS-IASB or U.S. GAAP. Prospective investors should consult their own accounting advisors for an understanding of the differences between IFRS-EU, IFRS-IASB and U.S. GAAP and how those differences might affect the financial information and other data presented in this Offering Memorandum. Some financial information and other numerical data in this Offering Memorandum have been rounded and, as a result, the numerical figures shown as totals in this Offering Memorandum may vary slightly from the exact arithmetic aggregation of the figures that precede them. We have included in this Offering Memorandum non-GAAP financial measures called EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. We define ‘‘EBITDA’’ as earnings before depreciation, amortization, non-recurring items, finance costs, net income from associates and income tax. EBITDA includes non-cash expenses and income, consisting of variations of inventories and operating provisions. EBITDA as presented herein and in our financial statements is not calculated in the same way as EBITDA is calculated under the Indentures and the New Revolving Credit Facility. We are not presenting EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as measures of our results of operations. We believe that the presentation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA enhances an investor’s understanding of our operating performance and our ability to service our debt. In addition, we believe EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are measures commonly used by investors. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not measurements of financial performance under U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to other indicators of our operating performance, cash flows or any other measure of performance derived in accordance with GAAP. In addition, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and similar measures are used by different companies for differing purposes and are often calculated in ways that reflect the circumstances of those companies. You should exercise caution in comparing EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as reported by us to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA of other companies. EBITDA as presented here differs from the definition of ‘‘Consolidated EBITDA’’ contained in the Indenture. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have important limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results of operations as reported under U.S. GAAP. For example, EBITDA-based measures: - do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures; - do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; - do not reflect the interest expense or cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt; - do not reflect any cash income taxes that we may be required to pay; - are not adjusted for all non-cash income or expense items that are reflected in our consolidated income statement; and ix ----- - do not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from certain matters we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations. Because of these limitations, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or as a measure of cash that will be available to us to meet our obligations. You should compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our IFRS-EU results and using EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA only supplementally to evaluate our performance. You are encouraged to evaluate each of the adjustments reflected in our presentation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA and whether you consider each to be appropriate. See ‘‘Summary—Summary Consolidated Financial Information and Other Data,’’ ‘‘Selected Consolidated Financial Information and Other Data,’’ ‘‘Operating and Financial Review and Prospects’’ and our Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. This Offering Memorandum also includes the unaudited condensed consolidated financial information as of and for the twelve months ended March 31, 2016 for the Issuer. Our financial information as of and for the twelve months ended March 31, 2016 was derived by aggregating without adjustments the relevant results of the year ended December 31, 2015 and the three months ended March 31, 2016 and subtracting the relevant results of the three months ended March 31, 2015. Our financial information as of and for the twelve months ended March 31, 2016 has been prepared for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily representative of our results of operations for any future period or our financial condition at any future date.

In specialty papers, the focus of our investments has been on shifting our product mix toward self-adhesive (e.g., labels and flexible packaging), metalized (e.g., labels for beer and spirit bottles), 1-side coated (e.g., premium shopping bags) and thermal (e.g., point-of-sale receipts) papers, all of which have been experiencing, and which we expect will continue to experience, growing demand due to the diversified range of day-to-day commercial applications of these papers. We have been successful in growing our sales in these key focus products at above market rates in 2015. We are particularly focused on wet-strength labels, top-coated thermal labels, betting applications and travel and admissions tickets. In addition, we have significant experience in homologation of new self-adhesive, metalized and 1-side coated products. Our know-how of coating technologies and base papers production position us well to develop new products for labelling and flexible packaging and provide a strong platform for expanding our product offerings into new industries. Our close proximity to European commercial printing markets, labels and flexible packaging customers and dedication to customer service enable us to shift our product mix in response to growth trends. From 2013 through 2015, we increased our deliveries of self-adhesive, metalized, 1-side coated and thermal papers by 27%.

We engage in a variety of targeted promotional activities and advertising to enhance the recognition of our brands, as we believe that this helps to differentiate our products. Customer Connectivity via Our Owned Distribution Platform._** In addition to our production activities, we operate a paper distribution business serving over 20,000 customers, distributing both our own CWF and specialty papers and those produced by third parties. Our integrated distribution business, combined with our Internet-based ordering platform, has allowed us to simplify ordering, tracking and invoicing, and is part of our strategy to continually reduce the logistics costs in our value chain. In addition, we operate an information system designed for collaborative production planning, procurement and inventory management processes throughout the supply chain. Our distribution group is a leader in Southern Europe, with the leading distribution market position in Spain and the second highest positions in France, Italy and Portugal. Overall, we believe we are the sixth largest European paper distribution group with sales volume of 535,000 metric tons for the twelve months ended March 31, 2016, including 134,000 metric tons of third party products. We currently sell our products through our distribution business in France, Italy Spain and Portugal. Our distribution business enhances our ability to provide a high level of customer service by improving our understanding of our customers’ product, final application and service needs, which allows us to more effectively develop and market new products to meet such requirements. In addition, our distribution business decreases concentration risk, with our top 10 customers in 2015 representing approximately 20% of our revenue. Our distribution business also enables us to reduce delivery time and increase our flexibility in adapting to customer needs.

172_2,Offerings 2016.md,9,SUMMARY,9.8,2015 sales by channel (value),9.8.1,,"Own distributors 38% Direct 23% 61% of sales (by value) are made to direct end users 28JUL201611245254 Optimal Location of Mills, Proximity to Customers and Flexibility and Variety in Production._** Our CWF and specialty paper mills are located in close proximity to our key commercial markets in Europe (France, Italy, Spain, Germany, the UK and Portugal) as well as our key customers. These CWF markets accounted for approximately 71% of demand in Europe and accounted for approximately 68% of our total deliveries in volume in 2015. We delivered approximately 67% of our specialty papers in Europe in 2015. The strategic location of our mills allows us to keep logistics costs down, which generally account for a substantial portion of delivered costs in our industry. Our main CWF competitors in Europe with mills in Nordic countries are located much further away from our customers and therefore incur higher logistics costs. Proximity to customers also allows us to better manage inventories and to provide improved customer service by being able to more quickly respond to our customers’ needs. Although most large paper machines produce reels of paper, most demand for CWF and specialty papers in Europe is for sheeted paper, which generates higher margins. As a result, most paper produced by paper mills needs to be converted to sheets, and in general this conversion takes place following specific customer orders. To reduce the delivery time of customers’ orders, paper manufacturers must operate converting facilities close to their principal markets. As our converting facilities are situated at or near our paper mills, our ability to efficiently satisfy orders while minimizing waste provides us with a cost advantage over most of our competitors. We manufacture our CWF on seven medium-width machines, which we believe are best suited for the production of most CWF products. Since the CWF market generally demands a greater variety of basis weights and surface finishes than other types of graphic paper, these machines allow us to produce our paper in a broad range of basis weights and coated surface finishes while maintaining optimal production runs with minimal waste and downtime between runs. Owned Energy Assets Providing Supply Security._** We own and operate five co-generation plants and benefit from a sixth plant at Condat, with a total installed capacity of 271MW. We generate more electricity than we consume through our co-generation plants that produce electrical and thermal energy fueled by natural gas or biomass, thereby helping to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions and raising energy efficiency. Supply Chain Integration._** Our integration in each stage of production provides us with full visibility of the entirety of our supply chain. Our ability to source approximately 30% of our own pulp and source approximately 76% of our base paper from our mills reduces earnings volatility and increases our manufacturing flexibility with respect to CWF and specialty papers. We are able to leverage our increasing base paper integration to generate higher profit margins. As a result of such supply chain integration, we optimize inventory costs and, with the visibility provided by our sales and marketing knowledge, are able to adapt the production process to the changing market environment with full control of the production chain and thereby add value to each stage. We are integrated upstream in energy and pulp production (partially), as well as downstream via our distribution business. We believe this provides us with a marked competitive advantage over other industry participants. Well-Invested Asset Base and Efficient, Low-Cost Production._** All of our mills and paper machines were modernized through a series of investment projects between 1999 and 2015, totaling approximately A1.0 billion focused on increasing added value, continuing cost reduction and increasing environmental performance and co-generation capabilities. We have reorganized production significantly through targeted headcount reductions, mill restructuring and closures, CWF production 4 ----- homogenization, the interchangeability of production among different mills and investment in co-generation. We intend to continue increasing our capacity production in specialty papers. We reduced overall labor costs by 7% between 2013 and 2015, primarily as a result of an overall reduction in headcount by approximately 14%. Our CWF machines are, we believe, among the most efficient in Europe and such efficiency, combined with low logistics and converting costs, provides us with a cost advantage in our key markets. Our concerted effort to produce at low-cost is underpinned by the many cost-reduction initiatives we have successfully implemented since 2013. We harmonized the bonus scheme across the Group. At our Italian mill, we converted part of the fixed labor costs into a variable cost linked to the performance of the company. Our Italian and French distribution businesses have been restructured to outsource the transportation activity and centralize management and administrative activities. Similarly, in Spain, we have centralized the Group’s financial activities and outsourced non-core activities at one of our mills. We have also embarked on a continuing plan to renegotiate labor agreements with unions to align incentives towards improved company performance. Skilled Personnel and Incentivized Management._** Our management team has significant operating experience and is highly regarded by participants in the paper industry. The management team has successfully reorganized our operations, which are now fully integrated, with centrally managed purchasing, sales, marketing, risk, management, finance and administration functions. Each of our senior managers has been granted an incentive package with a strong focus on increasing EBITDA and cash generation.",N/A,as_expected,2016,557
172_2,Offerings 2016.md,9,SUMMARY,9.9,Our Strategy,9.9.1,Continue to Increase Production of Specialties and Other Higher Margin Products with Growing,"Demand._** We intend to continue focusing on increasing the production of specialty paper products and distribution of higher grade, heavier weight and sheeted CWF products, which generate higher margins. In addition, we intend to continue focusing on increasing the share of certain specialty paper products in our product mix, notably self-adhesive, metalized, 1-side coated and thermal papers, which have all experienced, and we expect will continue to experience, growing demand, and which we have been successful in growing our sales at above market rates in 2015. Our know-how of coating technologies and base papers production positions us well to develop new products for labelling and flexible packaging, in order to best exploit new market opportunities. Maintain Low-Cost Production and Achieve Further Operating Efficiencies._** We believe we are a low-cost producer of CWF largely due to our past capital investment projects and capacity rationalization, which have improved the efficiency of our machines. From 2013 through 2015, we and the other European CWF producers experienced an improvement in operating ratio (ratio of CWF deliveries over CWF production capacity) from 86% in 2013 to 94% in 2015. We seek to further improve the efficiency of all of our mills through the vigorous application of best practices, the use of up-to-date technological processes and risk management techniques, and thereby increase our cost competitiveness and margins. We continue to take steps to increase productivity as measured by metric tons produced per employee. We also measure the performance of each of our mills against internal and external benchmarks relating to operational key indicators and raw material consumption. We currently benefit from six co-generation plants with a total installed capacity of 271MW, contributing to reducing our energy costs through the sale of excess electricity. Focus on Our Customers._** We continue to focus on our core target markets of France, Italy, Spain, Germany, the UK and Portugal where we enjoy brand awareness and cost advantage over our competitors. We may seek to further enhance our customer focus by expanding our distribution capabilities, while maintaining and further developing our relationships with third-party distributors. We may also seek to expand our direct sales to end-users, and we will continue to carefully evaluate acquisitions opportunities in the distribution area that may arise from time to time. Disciplined Investment in Key Focus Areas._** We intend to continue to evaluate opportunities to optimize our asset base, with a focus on existing areas with strong potential growth, including value 5 ----- added specialties as well as sheeted CWF and CWF in higher grades and heavier weights. As we have done in the past, we will continue to seek out opportunities to make disciplined investment in organic growth areas, such as machinery and marketing campaigns, which we expect to result in improved margins and returns. In addition, we are initiating an upgrade of our IT systems, which we expect to complete over the next three years. Continue to Respect the Environment._** We intend to continue focusing on the sustainability of our production and comply with the highest environmental standards. We have improved and will seek to continue improving our environmental performance by reducing our CO2 emissions, water use, energy consumption and sludge sent to disposal sites. We believe that our products and practices comply with the highest social and environmental standards in the market and all our mills have met the strictest audit standards, and carry ISO 14001 and EMAS Environmental Management certifications and ISO 50001 energy management certification guaranteeing transparent and responsible environmental performance. All of our wood and pulp purchases are sourced from sustainably-managed forests and certified under the PEFC (Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification) and FSC (Forest Stewardship Council) chain of custody standards. We also intend to continue publishing environmental reports and providing information on the sources of raw materials used in our products.",N/A,as_expected,2016,557

According to various industry analysts, it is expected that European demand for the type of specialty papers we produce is increasing in numerous applications and will experience moderate to strong annual growth rates from 2016 through 2018 (other than carbonless paper for which a decline is expected over the same period) due to structural growth drivers, such as new consumption habits and legislation (for example, in the food industry, requiring larger labels or relabeling of existing products). To respond to increasing demand in specialty papers, we are successfully shifting our product mix toward these paper grades, which enjoy healthy and growing markets. Our specialty paper sales by value increased from 19% of our revenue in 2011 to 27% in 2015.",N/A,as_expected,2016,557
172_2,Offerings 2016.md,9,SUMMARY,9.10,Industry Trends and Outlook,9.10.2,CWF,"_Reduction of Capacity_ In the past decade, the European CWF industry has experienced overcapacity, due to a history of industry-wide investment in new production capacity coupled with slower and often negative demand growth and a reduction in exports, which all contributed to reduced paper prices. In response to challenging conditions, CWF industry participants, including Lecta, closed almost 4.1 million metric tons of production capacity between 2006 and 2015, representing approximately 41% of the total European capacity in 2006, with Lecta alone accounting for approximately 350,000 metric tons of reduced capacity. _Demand for CWF_ In recent years, the growth of the commercial printing and advertising sectors in Europe has been continuously challenged due to the emergence of digital media. Total CWF volume deliveries in Europe in 2015 decreased by 2% compared to 2014, with this decrease affecting all Western European countries. According to EMGE, demand for CWF in Europe is expected to decrease at a CAGR of 1.9% from 2015 through 2020. At the same time, the European CWF industry was also negatively affected by CWF capacity expansions in Asia, which had the adverse effect of reducing Asian demand for both reels and sheeted products produced in Europe. In the other direction, exports from China to Western Europe accounted for 2% of CWF demand in 2015, with Chinese imports greatly restricted by anti-subsidy duties as high as 12% and anti-dumping duties of up to 35.1% imposed by the European Union on Chinese CWF imports in May 2011. Such duties were expected to expire in May 2016. On February 12, 2016, however, five EU CWF producers, including Lecta, filed a request with the European Commission for review of these duties. On May 13, 2016, the European Commission issued a notice of initiation of an expiry review. The anti-subsidy duties and the anti-dumping duties will continue to apply pending the 6 ----- outcome of the review, which is expected to be completed within 15 months of the publication of the notice.",N/A,as_expected,2016,557

In addition, we estimate that our loss after tax generated in the two months ended May 31, 2016 was between A(1) million and A0 million, which is better than our loss after tax for the corresponding period in 2015. The estimated increase in EBITDA for the two months ended May 31, 2016 is primarily due to an improvement in margin on variable costs and lower fixed costs. _The above information is based on our management’s review of our preliminary results and estimates, which have not been audited or reviewed by any audit firm, and is not intended to be a comprehensive statement of our financial or operational results for the two months ended May 31, 2016.

For more information, see ‘‘Description of the Notes—Credit enhancement,’’ ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and Our Structure—The Guarantees are significantly limited by applicable laws and are subject to certain limitations or defenses’’ and ‘‘Limitation on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests.’’ See also Annex A hereto. Ranking of the Guarantees . . . . . .** The Guarantee of each Guarantor will be a general unsubordinated obligation of such Guarantor and will: - rank pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future debt of such Guarantor that is not subordinated to such Guarantee; - rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future subordinated obligations of such Guarantor; - be secured by security interests in the Collateral in favor of the Security Trustee over certain of such Guarantor’s assets, including shares in certain subsidiaries, but not all assets and no real property; - be structurally subordinated to all liabilities (including trade payables), disqualified stock and preferred stock of such Guarantor’s subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes; and - be effectively subordinated to any existing and future debt of such Guarantor that is secured with property and assets that do not secure such Guarantee, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such debt. Security . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The Notes and related Guarantees (other than the Guarantee to be provided by Polyedra S.p.A.) will be secured by security interests in certain of the Issuer’s or the Guarantors’ assets, consisting, in the case of the Issuer, of its shares in Sub Lecta S.A., its bank account and the Intercompany Loans held by it, and in the case of the several Guarantors, of shares in certain subsidiaries held by such Guarantors and certain other assets. The security interests in the Collateral securing the Notes and the Guarantees will be first ranking except that the New Revolving Credit Facility and certain hedging debt will be repaid in priority upon enforcement of the security. The security interests will be granted by the Guarantors and the Issuer in favor of the Security Trustee for the benefit of the finance parties under the New Revolving Credit Facility, certain hedging counterparties and the Floating Rate Senior Secured Notes Trustee as trustee for the holders of the Floating Rate Senior Secured Notes and the Fixed Rate Senior Secured Notes Trustee as trustee for the holders of the Fixed Rate Senior Secured Notes. 14 ----- Should the Company transfer the distribution business of Torraspapel S.A. to Dispap S.A. in connection with the Permitted Reorganization, we have agreed that, within 15 days after such transfer is effective, Dispap S.A. will provide certain security interests in certain of its assets as part of the Collateral. See ‘‘Description of the Notes—Credit enhancement—Post-Closing Actions’’ and Annex A hereto for a description of the Collateral. For more information, see ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and Our Structure,’’ ‘‘Description of the Notes—Credit enhancement’’ and ‘‘Limitation on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests.’’ Intercreditor Agreement . . . . . . . .** Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, the Floating Rate Senior Secured Notes Trustee and the Fixed Rate Senior Secured Notes Trustee will agree to certain provisions that, among other things, give effect to the priority of the application of proceeds in the event of enforcement. In particular, proceeds from the sale of the Collateral shall be applied first in favor of the lenders under the New Revolving Credit Facility and certain hedging counterparties and thereafter to the Floating Rate Senior Secured Notes Trustee on behalf of holders of Floating Rate Senior Secured Notes and the Fixed Rate Senior Secured Notes Trustee on behalf of holders of Fixed Rate Senior Secured Notes and to other Pari Passu Debt (as defined therein) that is secured by the Collateral. In addition, the Intercreditor Agreement provides that holders of the Floating Rate Senior Secured Notes and the Fixed Rate Senior Secured Notes will vote in respect of the enforcement of the Collateral as a single class and that only the Security Trustee can enforce security. See ‘‘Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement.’’ Optional Redemption . . . . . . . . . .** Prior to August 1, 2017, we will be entitled at our option to redeem all or a portion of the Floating Rate Senior Secured Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus the applicable ‘‘make-whole’’ premium described in this Offering Memorandum and accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the redemption date.

172_2,Offerings 2016.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Business,13.1.1,"Customer demand is difficult to forecast accurately and, as a result, we may be unable to match production of our specialty products with customer demand.","We make planning and spending decisions, including determining the levels of business that we will seek and accept, production schedules, component procurement commitments, personnel needs and other resource requirements, based on our estimates of product demand and customer requirements. Our specialty products are typically purchased pursuant to individual purchase orders. While our customers may provide us with their demand forecasts, they are typically not contractually committed to buy any quantity of products beyond firm purchase orders. Furthermore, many of our customers may increase, decrease, cancel or delay purchase orders already in place without significant penalty. The short-term nature of commitments by our customers and the possibility of unexpected changes in demand for their products reduce our ability to accurately estimate future customer requirements. On occasion, customers may require rapid increases in production, which can strain our resources, cause our manufacturing to be negatively impacted by materials shortages, necessitate more onerous procurement commitments and reduce our gross margin. We may not have sufficient capacity at any given time to meet the volume demands of our customers, or one or more of our suppliers may not have sufficient capacity at any given time to meet our volume demands. If any of our major customers decrease, stop or delay purchasing our products for any reason, we will likely have excess manufacturing capacity or inventory and it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.",N/A,as_expected,2016,557
172_2,Offerings 2016.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Business,13.1.2,"We operate in a cyclical industry, in which product prices and raw material costs are volatile, and periods of low product prices or high raw material costs negatively affect our profitability and cash flows.","The markets for our products and raw materials are commodity markets to a significant extent and prices for our products are affected by industry-wide production and capacity levels and by demand for our products, which are influenced by global economic trends, demographic trends, technological developments, trends in end-user preferences and inventory levels maintained by our customers. Changes in these factors have resulted in significant fluctuations in the prices for our products. The timing and the magnitude of changes in our product prices have varied significantly over time and have been unpredictable. Changes in prices differ between products and geographic regions. While we are a significant participant in most of the markets in which we compete, neither our actions nor those of any one industry participant have more than a small influence on changes in product prices. Our main raw material costs are for pulp and energy. A significant increase in prices we pay for these raw materials would significantly increase our production costs and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows if we were unable to increase our product prices sufficiently to maintain margins. Compared to many of our competitors, we are particularly susceptible to volatility in pulp prices because we have a lower degree of pulp integration, do not hedge against fluctuations in the price of pulp and have limited ability to pass through pulp price increases to our customers. World pulp prices have been considerably volatile in recent years as a result of periodic supply/demand imbalances in the pulp and paper industries and are subject to significant fluctuations over short periods of time depending on a number of factors, including global demand for pulp products, global pulp production capacity and inventories, strategies adopted by major pulp producers, and the availability of substitutes for various pulp products. All of these factors are beyond our control. Price fluctuations occur not only from year to year but also within 23 ----- a given year as a result of global and regional economic conditions, capacity constraints, facility openings and closures, and the supply of and demand for both raw materials and finished products, among other factors. For example, between 2011 and 2013, the price of pulp remained generally stable, which was attributable in large part to an increased demand for pulp combined with limited increases in production capacity during this period due to delays in greenfield projects in the pulp industry and closures and/or conversions of existing pulp mills. However, the price of pulp decreased in early 2014 due to weakness in demand before stabilizing during the third quarter of 2014. During the last quarter of 2014 and 2015, prices began increasing again as a result of low customer inventories and increased demand for pulp. In late 2015 prices began to decrease due to ongoing pulp capacity increases, particularly in Latin America, and lower demand. Pulp prices have continued decreasing in the first and second quarters of 2016. As a result of unpredictable and substantial changes in our product prices and raw material costs, our financial results have varied significantly over time. In a period of sustained low product prices or high raw material costs, we may be unable to operate our production facilities in a cost-effective manner, pursue our strategic initiatives and meet all of our financial obligations. Paper manufacturing is a highly capital-intensive industry and a large portion of our operating costs, as well as those of our competitors, are fixed. Additionally, paper machines are large and complex and are more efficient when operated continuously. Consequently, certain manufacturers choose to continue to run their machines whenever marginal sales exceed the marginal costs. Our ability to achieve acceptable margins is principally dependent on managing our cost structure and managing changes in raw material prices, which represent a large component of our operating costs and fluctuate based upon factors beyond our control. If the prices of our products decline, or if our raw material costs increase, or both, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.",N/A,as_expected,2016,557
172_2,Offerings 2016.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Business,13.1.3,"Global economic conditions and political events could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.","We have historically faced, and continue to face, significant exposure to global economic trends, fluctuating levels of investment in advertising and other activities which foster demand for our products and general liquidity and credit conditions. We cannot predict with any certainty what impact such events could have on our major customers, including a disruption in the ability of our significant customers to access sources of liquidity, or on our ability to implement our strategic plans and we may face difficulties in successfully marketing our products, collecting on our accounts receivable and/or obtaining financing for our business on terms acceptable to us. Uncertainty caused by the prevailing adverse economic conditions contributed to a reduction in business and consumer spending in, among others, the advertising industry, from which we derive a significant amount of the demand for our products. From 2012 to 2014, the demand for specialty papers in Europe displayed overall slight growth, with relatively strong growth rates in labelling and flexible packaging, pressure-sensitive label, metallized, release base and self-adhesive paper products. In 2015, however, there were modest reductions in overall demand in Europe, partly because of the weak performance of woodfree paper products due to the structural decline in demand for these products. The slow recovery of the global economy has been and continues to be uneven and significant risks remain as a result of turmoil in the sovereign debt markets, in Europe generally and in Southern Europe in particular. Financial markets and the supply of credit may continue to be negatively impacted by ongoing fears surrounding the sovereign debts and/or fiscal deficits of several countries in Europe, the possibility of further downgrading of, or defaults on, sovereign debt, concerns about a slowdown in growth in certain economies and uncertainties regarding the overall stability of the euro and the sustainability of the euro as a single currency given the diverse economic and political circumstances in individual Member States. We cannot predict the severity, timing or duration of any future downturn in our key markets, including if economic conditions deteriorate as a result of sovereign debt concerns or any other economic factor. In addition, past or future political events in Europe could cause further economic uncertainty in Europe and globally. Our main market, Spain, is experiencing a period of political uncertainty. Following the 2015 general elections, no party secured an absolute majority, resulting in a fragmented parliament. A second general election was held on June 26, 2016 and no party has been able to secure an absolute majority and to install a government. In September 2015, a coalition of political parties called Junts per Si won the most seats in the Catalan regional parliament. This development may lead to greater calls for the secession of Catalonia. Although the constitutionality of the secession movement 24 ----- is not clear, political uncertainty could result, which could adversely affect the Spanish economy and our business. In the three months ended March 31, 2016 and the year ended December 31, 2015, our paper sales in Spain represented 16% and 15%, respectively, of our paper sales by volume. The occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.",N/A,as_expected,2016,557
172_2,Offerings 2016.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Business,13.1.4,"The United Kingdom’s recent referendum on membership in the European Union and the results of implementing that referendum may adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.","In a non-binding referendum on the United Kingdom’s membership in the European Union on June 23, 2016, a majority of the United Kingdom’s electorate voted for the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union. If the outcome of the referendum eventually results in the exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union (‘‘Brexit’’), a process of negotiation would determine the future terms of the United Kingdom’s relationship with the European Union. The UK government has not, as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, indicated a timeline for taking any legal acts necessary to effectuate Brexit. We cannot assure you when, if ever, the UK government will begin the withdrawal process and, if and when it does, how long such process would take. Relevant European Union law suggests that any negotiation could last up to two years before withdrawal takes effect. The result of the referendum has caused and is likely in the future to cause volatility in the financial markets. Such volatility may affect prevailing interest rates, which in turn may affect our business operations by increasing our cost of servicing our borrowings subject to variable interest rates (including the New Revolving Credit Facility and the Floating Rate Senior Secured Notes) and increasing the cost of refinancing of our existing borrowings. See ‘‘—We are exposed to interest rate risks as certain of our borrowings bear interest at floating rates that could rise significantly, increasing our interest cost and reducing cash flow.’’ Such volatility may also adversely affect our ability to refinance our existing indebtedness when due on commercially acceptable terms or at all. See ‘‘—Risks Related to the Notes and Our Structure—We require a significant amount of cash to service our debt and for other general corporate purposes. Our ability to generate sufficient cash depends on many factors beyond our control.’’ The result of the referendum may in the future cause certain adverse effects on European economic conditions and may have adverse effects on levels of economic activity in the states in which we operate, including, but not limited to, adverse effects on investment in advertising and other activities which foster demand for our products. See ‘‘—Global economic conditions and political events could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.’’ Depending on the terms of Brexit, if any, the United Kingdom could also lose access to the single EU market and to the global trade deals negotiated by the European Union on behalf of its members. A decline in trade could also affect the attractiveness of the United Kingdom as a global investment center and, as a result, could have a detrimental impact on the level of investment in the United Kingdom and ultimately on UK economic growth. The uncertainty concerning the timing and terms of Brexit could also have a negative impact on the growth of the UK economy and cause greater volatility in the pound sterling. New or modified trading arrangements between the United Kingdom and other countries may have a material adverse effect on our export volumes to the United Kingdom. Any of the foregoing factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.",N/A,as_expected,2016,557
172_2,Offerings 2016.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Business,13.1.5,"Changes in economic conditions, consumer preferences or new technologies will continue to affect our business and our ability to compete successfully.","Much of the demand for our products is generated directly or indirectly by the advertising industry, whether by printers, direct mail campaigns, magazine publishers or other ultimate end-users of paper. As a result, when the economy is growing, our customers’ demand for our products generally increases, but when the economy slows, advertising and promotional expenditures are generally cut back and our customers’ demand for our products declines. Historically, when the global economy is growing, spending on advertising increases sooner and at a faster rate than the overall economic growth rate, and conversely, when the global economy slows, spending on advertising decreases sooner and to a greater extent than the overall economic slowdown. We are therefore vulnerable to a weakening economy, and any slowing or perceived slowing of the economy in general or the advertising market in 25 ----- particular could be expected to have an adverse impact on our customers’ demand for our products and, therefore, to adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Changes in consumer preferences affect both the demand for paper in general and the demand for specific grades of paper. Our ability to continue to meet the shifting demands of paper consumers depends upon a variety of factors, including our ability to foresee or identify changes in consumer preferences. Some of the most significant changes in consumer preferences include interest in environmentally friendly products and the use of e-mail and electronic media instead of paper. The widespread availability of electronic media and the Internet and the trend towards ever greater use of computers may reduce the demand for paper and generally have a significant adverse impact on future paper consumption patterns. In addition, we believe that new technologies or novel processes may emerge and that existing technologies may be further developed in the fields in which we operate, both of which could impact production methods or product quality. Unexpected rapid changes in employed technologies or the development of novel processes that affect our operations and product range could render the technologies we utilize or the products we produce obsolete or less competitive in the future. If we are unable to successfully anticipate technological developments, we may be forced to implement these new technologies at a substantial cost. Any such development could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We have made significant investments in order to shift our product mix towards higher margin products, such as value-added specialty papers and are focusing our marketing and distribution efforts on customers who require these products based on industry analysis and company information that indicates that demand for these products, unlike demand in the broader CWF industry, will increase over the medium term due to the diversified range of day-to-day commercial applications of these papers. We cannot assure you that such demand increases will occur or will occur to the extent necessary for our strategy to succeed. To the extent that demand does not increase to the extent we forecast, this could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.",N/A,as_expected,2016,557
172_2,Offerings 2016.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Business,13.1.6,"Substitution towards digital media and changes in consumer preferences has adversely affected, and will continue to adversely affect, demand for our graphic paper products.","Graphic paper demand in Europe and North America has been in decline since 2009. While some of the decline can be attributed to weak economic conditions, increased substitution for digital media has been, and will continue to be, a significant driver of this trend. Over the last ten to fifteen years, the pulp and paper industry has encountered a growing transformation in consumer preferences. During this time, readership and circulation of newspapers and magazines has been declining, accessibility to, and use of, the Internet has increased and mobile devices, including digital tablets, have become commonplace. As a result, digital alternatives to many traditional paper applications, including print publishing and advertising, and the storage, duplication, transmission and consumption of written information more generally, are now readily available. We expect competition from digital media to continue to adversely affect demand for graphic paper products across the industry, leading to oversupply, declining revenues from paper businesses and reductions in high cost paper manufacturing capacity to balance declining demand. Our magazine and catalogue publishing customers may increasingly use, and compete with businesses that use, other forms of media advertising, and electronic data transmission and storage, particularly the Internet, and including personal data devices such as smartphones, e-readers and tablets, instead of paper made by us. In addition, electronic formats for textbooks could cause the demand to decline for paper textbooks. As the use of these alternatives grows, demand for our paper products could decline. We are responding by cutting costs and maintaining operating rates to maximize the significant cash generation potential of these businesses, while simultaneously shifting our product mix towards expanding our offering of specialty papers.",N/A,as_expected,2016,557
172_2,Offerings 2016.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Business,13.1.7,We face intense competition in our industry.,"Our business is highly competitive, and competition is mainly based on price. We frequently experience pricing pressure from competitors in many of our product lines and geographic markets. Our ability to compete effectively depends on our cost competitiveness. Some of our competitors may be lower cost producers than we are in certain markets and may offer our customers competing 26 ----- products at more attractive prices. This competitive environment has been a principal factor behind the large fluctuations in profitability we have experienced in recent years. We compete principally with a number of large international paper companies, as well as with numerous regional and more specialized competitors. Many of our competitors have advantages that can adversely impact our ability to compete with them. These advantages include lower raw material and labor costs, as well as, compared to our non-European competitors, fewer environmental and governmental regulations to comply with than we do. In particular, our competitors who operate fully integrated production processes are not as vulnerable to increases in the cost of pulp and so are able to sustain lower prices without suffering deteriorating margins at times of high raw material prices. Furthermore, some of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we have or may be better positioned than we are to compete in certain geographic areas. Foreign overcapacity could result in an increase in the supply of paper products available in our markets. Certain Asian producers, in particular, have significantly increased exports until 2013 as producers in China were selling in our markets at less than fair value and have been subsidized by their governments, which is beyond our control. In May 2011, however, the European Union imposed anti-subsidy duties as high as 12% and anti-dumping duties of up to 35.1% on Chinese CWF imports, which has led to a substantial decline in such imports. As a result of the duties, which are expected to remain in place until May 2016, Chinese exports to Western Europe have declined significantly since 2013. Such duties were to expire in May 2016. On February 12, 2016, however, five EU CWF producers, including Lecta, filed a request with the European Commission for review of these duties. On May 13, 2016, the European Commission issued a notice of initiation of an expiry review. The anti-subsidy duties and the anti-dumping duites will continue to apply pending the outcome of the review, which is expected to be completed within 15 months of the publication of the notice. Should the European Commission decide not to extend the application of these duties, it is not possible to predict whether affected producers will increase their sales volume in our markets. The anti-dumping duties for imports into North America were due to expire in October 2015 but have remained in place while under review by the U.S. International Trade Commission. A determination by the U.S. International Trade Commission that injury is unlikely to occur to U.S. producers and workers as a result of coated paper imports into the United States from China and Indonesia could lead to the existing duties being revoked by the U.S. Department of Commerce with retroactive effect to October 2015. In January 2016, the U.S. International Trade Commission voted to conduct a full review in light of the interest shown by local U.S. industry. A determination is not expected until late 2016. In the absence of such duties, it is likely that Chinese exporters will again increase their CWF exports into our core markets, which could reduce our market share. Further, increased competition, including a decrease in import duties in accordance with the terms of free trade agreements, could cause us to lose market share, increase expenditures or reduce pricing, any of which have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, competitive pressures will continue to require us to make significant investments in our manufacturing facilities and in product development. There can be no assurance that we will have sufficient resources to maintain appropriate levels of capital investment in the future in response to competitive pressures. In addition, the following factors will affect our ability to compete: - the quality of our products; - the breadth of our product offerings, including our ability to develop specialty papers in line with demand; - our ability to maintain plant efficiencies and high operating rates and thus lower our average manufacturing costs per ton; - customer service and our ability to distribute our products on time; and - the availability and/or cost of pulp, energy and other raw materials and labor.

In the year ended December 31, 2015, our 10 largest customers accounted for approximately 20% of our total net sales. See ‘‘Business—Customers.’’ In addition, some of our largest paper distributors and printer customers have been negatively affected by the ongoing economic turmoil and their credit profiles have deteriorated over time. Such changes cannot be predicted and their impacts may be severe. For example, a disruption in the ability of our significant customers to access liquidity could cause serious disruptions or an overall deterioration of their businesses, which could lead to a significant reduction in their future orders of our products and the inability or failure on their part to meet their payment obligations to us, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. For example, EBITDA in the year ended December 31, 2015 was affected by the bankruptcy of three subsidiaries of one of our major customers, which, despite the protective measures put in place, amounted to approximately A6.5 million and included a write off of receivables and logistics costs. Similarly, sustained adverse changes in market conditions for our significant customers’ products, such as lower demand or prices or increased competition, could also reduce future orders of our products and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. This may result in the exit of certain customers from the market and/or in further consolidation among our client base; resulting in higher purchasing power for the remaining customers.

Any future acquisitions or investments will also involve financial, managerial and operational challenges, including: - the diversion of management attention from other business concerns; - difficulty with integrating businesses, operations, personnel and financial and other systems; - difficulty in obtaining regulatory approvals; - increased levels of debt potentially leading to an associated reduction in the ratings of our debt securities; - an adverse impact on our various financial ratios; - the potential loss of key employees and customers; - the assumption of and exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of acquired businesses; and - potential disputes with sellers. In addition, we could experience financial or other setbacks if any of the businesses that we have acquired or may acquire in the future have problems of which we are not aware or liabilities that exceed expectations.

We have announced a number of initiatives 29 ----- intended to, among other things, reduce recurring costs through labor force reductions, as well as undertaken certain efficiency measures intended to reduce waste and raw material use and improve plant productivity. In 2014 and 2015, we spent A35 million and A10.8 million, respectively, for cost reduction and productivity improvement.

Compliance with these laws and regulations is a significant aspect of our industry, and substantial legal and financial resources are required to ensure compliance and to manage environmental risks. Moreover, environmental laws and regulations applicable to us are likely to become more stringent in the future. For example, the EU Emissions Trading Scheme, which is effective in the countries in which our mills operate, requires progressively greater reductions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse-gas emissions during its third phase of regulation from 2013 to 2020 by requiring regulated installations to surrender allowances to competent authorities to account for their emissions, which allowances they must purchase in auctions. Our mills and co-generation facilities generate such gases, and any further limitations applicable to us may require material expenditures and may have other adverse consequences. In addition, our facilities have been licensed under the EU the Industrial Emissions Directive, and conditions imposed by authorities as part of this licensing scheme, or the licensing scheme under its successor, are likely to become more stringent over time and require material capital and other expenditures. Our industry also faces increasing public and community pressure to consume energy more efficiently, including through the use of renewable fuels, and to reduce waste. In addition, the European paper industry is required to procure wood and pulp from sustainably managed forests through a number of certification schemes such as the EU Timber Regulation. While 100% of the wood used to manufacture our products currently comes from such forests, we may be required to implement additional measures in an effort to address these concerns in the future, which may require us to invest substantial resources in adjusting and modifying our production processes. The risk of substantial environmental costs and liabilities is inherent in our industry, and there can be no assurance that any incurrence by us of such costs and liabilities, or the adoption of increasingly strict environmental laws, regulations and enforcement policies and practices, will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Although we strive to ensure that our facilities comply with all applicable environmental laws and permits required for our operations, we have in the past been, and may in the future be, subject to governmental enforcement actions for failure to comply with environmental regulations. Impacts from historical operations, including the land or water disposal of waste materials, or our own activities may require costly investigation and clean-up. In addition, we could become subject to environmental liabilities resulting from personal injury (including from exposure to hazardous materials in the workplace), property damage or natural resources damage. Expenditures to comply with future environmental requirements and the costs related to any potential environmental liabilities and claims could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 30 -----",N/A,as_expected,2016,557
172_2,Offerings 2016.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Business,13.1.15,Regulatory changes have affected our business historically and any future changes may have an adverse effect on our energy activities.,"Each of the Spanish, French and Italian energy sectors is subject to extensive regulation. This applies to both conventional and renewable energy sources. We are especially vulnerable to changes to existing regulations affecting our electricity generating activities, which may have a material adverse effect on our business. For example, in June 2014, the Spanish government approved a regulatory framework for the electricity generating activities from renewable energy sources, cogeneration and waste (the ‘‘Regulatory Framework’’). This framework sets out a remuneration scheme for existing renewable, co-generation and waste generation facilities, which applies to our operations. The Regulatory Framework provides for regulated levels of remuneration that the government has fixed for our electricity production over three- to six-year periods. The first three-year period and the six-year period end on December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2019, respectively. While the government may alter the rate of investment return applicable to the most proximate future period, it may not alter the initial investment value or the regulatory useful life of the investment. As a result of the implementation of the Regulatory Framework through Royal Decree Law 9/2013 to ensure financial stability of the electricity sector, Law 24/2013 on the Electricity Sector, Royal Decree 413/2014, Ministerial Order IET/1045/2014 and Ministerial Order IET 1344/2015, we may be vulnerable to several operational risks, including the following: - the Regulatory Framework creates uncertainty over whether the government may introduce a less favorable remuneration structure applicable to the most proximate future period, which may affect our ability to make adequate provisions for future operations; - our operating costs may exceed those assumed by the government in its calculation of the amount of remuneration payable under the Regulatory Framework, in which case the Regulatory Framework would not provide for a reimbursement of the additional costs incurred by us; - we could fail to meet the requisite minimum number of hours of operation per year that the Regulatory Framework sets out, which may reduce or eliminate our revenue for the relevant year; and/or - we could be forced to participate in financing any temporary imbalance or deficit that is not offset through tolls and charges in an amount of up to 2% of the estimated regulated income for the year and proportionally to the remuneration obtained. While we could claim a credit for the financed amount within a five-year period, the obligation to finance any temporary imbalance could adversely affect our financial position. In addition to the Regulatory Framework, electricity producers are required to pay a transmission and distribution system access fee. In 2011, the government fixed this fee at A0.50 per MWh delivered to the network. While the fee has remained unchanged to date, any decision by the government to raise the fee could adversely affect our revenue. Such annual output caps, as well as other regulatory provisions, have thus had an adverse effect on the revenue of our business historically, and may prevent us from fully realizing the benefits of increases in our generation capacity and/or increases in the market price for electricity in the future. Unexpected cogeneration regulatory changes in Spain adversely impacted our results of operations. For example, excluding the impact of the Spanish regulatory changes and applying 2012 conditions, our EBITDA would have been A24 million and A33 million higher in 2013 and 2014, respectively. Current regulatory requirements in the energy sector could continue to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

The limited testing for contamination that has taken place at certain of our properties may not be sufficient to ascertain the extent of our obligations with respect to any contamination relating to any of 31 ----- our facilities. Asbestos-containing materials (‘‘ACM’’) were formerly commonly used as building materials such as insulation or tiling in industrial buildings. The use of ACM was standard practice throughout the world until the late 1970s. Given the varying ages of our Spanish and French facilities, we have identified ACM as being present at certain facilities. The laws of such jurisdictions can impose liability on an owner or occupier of property for contamination at or emanating from the property, regardless of who caused the contamination, when it was caused or whether the activity that caused the contamination was legal at the time. We have incurred costs to investigate and remediate contamination in the past and may in the future be subject to substantial costs and liabilities relating to contamination.

Our long-term employee benefit provisions include, among others, obligations under statutory pension plans and voluntary plans. Our long-term employee benefit provisions amounted to A25.8 million as of March 31, 2016. The cost of defined benefit pension plans and other post-employment benefits is determined using actuarial valuations. Actuarial valuations involve making assumptions about discount rates, expected rates of return on plan assets, future salary increases, mortality rates and future pension increases. Due to the long-term nature of these plans, such estimates are subject to significant uncertainty. If actual results, especially discount rates, expected rates of return on assets or mortality rates were to differ from our assumptions, our pension obligations could be higher than expected and we could incur actuarial gains and losses. Changes in all assumptions or under-performance of plan assets could also adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. For defined benefit retirement plans, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date. We recognize all actuarial gains and losses in equity and deferred taxes in the period in which they occur. 32 ----- Other costs are recognized in the income statement. Past services cost is recognized immediately to the extent that the benefits are already vested, and otherwise is amortized on a straight-line basis over the average period until the amended benefits become vested. Differences between estimated and actual returns on plan assets can require us to record additional expenses. If invested pension plan assets perform negatively or below assumptions, we would incur actuarial losses and we could have to revise our assumptions. Future declines in the value of plan assets or lower-than expected returns may require us to make additional current cash payments to pension plans or non-cash charges to our income statement.

We are also required to purchase carbon dioxide emission credits commensurate with our emissions, the price of which may significantly increase. We started making payments for carbon dioxide emissions in the summer of 2015. In 2015, we paid approximately A1 million for carbon dioxide emission credits. The regulatory framework to which we are subject imposes significant actual, day-to-day compliance burdens, costs and risks on us.

Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, the Super Senior Liabilities will have priority over any amounts received from the sale of the Collateral pursuant to an enforcement action taken with respect to the Collateral. As such, in the event of a foreclosure of the Collateral, you may not be able to recover on the Collateral if the then outstanding claims under the Super Senior Liabilities are greater than the proceeds realized. Any proceeds from an enforcement sale of the Collateral by any creditor will, after all Super Senior Liabilities have been discharged from such recoveries, be applied pro rata in repayment of the Notes and any other obligations secured by the Collateral on a pro rata basis.

In the event of conflicting instructions, the parties providing or entitled to provide instructions must consult for a further 15 days (or such period as agreed among them) with a view to resolving the conflict. The Security Trustee will take enforcement action with respect to the Collateral only if so instructed by the holders of the Notes/Pari Passu Holders, unless either no such liabilities remain outstanding or six months have elapsed since any of the lenders under the New Revolving Credit Facility, the holders of the Notes or Pari Passu Holders took enforcement action with respect to an event of default under the applicable agreement, in which case the instructions of the lenders under the New Revolving Credit Facility shall prevail.

Furthermore, the first-priority ranking of 39 ----- security interests can be affected by a variety of factors, including, among others, the timely satisfaction of perfection requirements, statutory liens or recharacterization under the laws of certain jurisdictions. The security interests of the Security Trustee will be subject to practical problems generally associated with the realization of security interests over real or personal property such as the Collateral. For example the Security Trustee may need to obtain the consent of a third party to enforce a security interest. We cannot assure you that the Security Trustee will be able to obtain any such consents. We also cannot assure you that the consents of any third parties will be given when required to facilitate a foreclosure on such assets. Accordingly, the Security Trustee may not have the ability to foreclose upon those assets, and the value of the Collateral may significantly decrease. In addition, we are required to register our various operations with national regulators. Such requirements may prohibit foreclosure on our share capital or may require us to incur significant cost and expense due to such requirements. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that any applicable governmental authorities will consent to such action.

172_2,Offerings 2016.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.2,Risks Related to the Notes and Our Structure,13.2.12,The ability of the Security Trustee to enforce the Collateral may be restricted by local law.,"Under Luxembourg law, the validity, legality, performance and enforceability of the Collateral is subject to, and may be affected or limited by, the provisions of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation, moratorium or reprieve from payment (sursis de paiement), controlled management (gestion _contrˆol´ee), general settlement or composition with creditors (concordat pr´eventif de faillite), fraudulent_ conveyance, reorganization or similar Luxembourg or foreign laws affecting the rights of creditors generally and thus the ability of the Security Trustee to enforce the Collateral may be restricted. Under Italian law there is some uncertainty (a) if the beneficial owners of the Notes that are not identified as registered holders in the pledge agreement will be deemed to have a valid and perfected security interest under such pledge and (b) with respect to the validity of any security interest created in favor of the Security Trustee under the Notes on behalf of the holders of the Notes. In addition, the enforceability of Italian law-governed security interest granted in favor of the creditor of a parallel debt is uncertain and has not been tested before the Italian courts and, accordingly, the Italian law governed security interest does not secure the ‘‘parallel debt obligations’’. If any challenge to the validity, perfection or enforceability of the security interests created by the pledges or the validity of the parallel debt structure were successful, the holders of the Notes may be unable to recover any amounts under the pledges. Also, under Italian law, in the event that the relevant obligor enters into insolvency, liquidation or other analogous proceedings, the pledges could be subject to potential challenges by an insolvency administrator or by other creditors of such obligor under the rules of avoidance or clawback of Italian insolvency laws and the relevant law on the non-insolvency avoidance or clawback of transactions by the debtor. Under French law, a pledge over shares may be enforced at the option of the Security Trustee either (i) by means of a sale of the pledged shares in a public auction (the proceeds of the sale being paid to the secured creditors and any excess over the amount of the secured debt being paid to the legal owner of the collateral) or (ii) by attribution judiciaire or conventionnelle of the shares in favor of the secured creditor, following which the secured creditor becomes the legal owner of the pledged shares. In foreclosure proceedings under option (ii), an expert values the collateral (in this case, the 40 ----- shares) and, if the expert determines that the value of the collateral exceeds the amount of secured debt, the secured creditor may be required to pay the obligor an amount (soulte) equal to the difference between the value of the shares as determined by the expert and the amount of the secured debt. This is true regardless of the actual amount of proceeds ultimately received by the secured creditor from a subsequent sale of the pledged shares. As a result, if the Security Trustee enforces the Collateral pursuant to option (i), the proceeds of the sale of the Collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy the claims of all secured creditors. If the Security Trustee enforces the Collateral pursuant to option (ii), there is a risk that the secured creditors may not be able to sell the Collateral for its full value as determined by the court-appointed expert, yet still be required to pay the pledgor, at the time the Security Trustee becomes the legal owner of the Collateral, the difference between the value of the Collateral and the amount of the secured debt if the Collateral is determined by the court-appointed expert to have a greater value than the amount of the secured debt. In addition, as there is currently no established concept of ‘‘trust’’ or ‘‘trustee’’ under French law, the precise nature, effect and enforceability of the duties, rights and powers of a security agent as trustee for holders of the Notes in respect of security interests such as pledges are uncertain under French law. A concept of fiduciary agent (fiduciaire) was recently incorporated in French law, but the effects of such incorporation on the recognition of foreign law-governed ‘‘trusts’’ are not yet clear.

As a result, a Guarantor’s liability under its Guarantees could be materially reduced or eliminated depending upon the amounts of its other obligations and upon applicable laws. In particular, in certain jurisdictions, a guarantee issued by a company that is not in that company’s corporate interests or the burden of which exceeds the benefit to the company may not be valid and enforceable. It is possible that a Guarantor, a creditor of a Guarantor or the insolvency administrator, in the case of an insolvency of a Guarantor, may contest the validity and enforceability of the respective Guarantee and that the applicable court may determine that the Guarantee should be limited or voided. In the event that any Guarantee is deemed invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, or to the extent that agreed limitations on the Guarantee apply, the Notes would be effectively subordinated to all liabilities of the applicable Guarantor, including trade payables of such Guarantor.

There is no existing trading market for the Notes and there can be no assurance that a trading market for the Notes will develop. We cannot predict the extent to which investor interest in our company will lead to the development of an active trading market or how liquid that trading market might become. Although the Initial Purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market in the Notes, they are not obligated to do so and may stop at any time. The market price of our Notes may be influenced by many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including: - changes in demand, the supply or pricing of our products; - general economic conditions, including raw material prices; - the activities of competitors; - our quarterly or annual earnings or those of our competitors; - investor perceptions of us and the CWF industry; - the failure of securities analysts to cover our Notes after this Offering or changes in financial estimates by analysts; - the public’s reaction to our press releases or our other public announcements; - future sales of Notes; and - other factors described under these ‘‘Risk Factors.’’ As a result of these factors, you may not be able to resell your Notes at or above the initial offering price. In addition, securities trading markets experience extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of a particular company. These broad market fluctuations and industry factors may materially reduce the market price of our Notes, regardless of our operating performance. If an active trading market does not develop, you may have difficulty selling any Notes that you buy. The Notes have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act or any U.S. securities laws and we have not undertaken to effect any exchange offer for the Notes in the future. You may not offer the Notes for sale in the United States except pursuant to an exemption from, or a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and applicable state securities laws, or pursuant to an effective registration statement. The Notes and the Indentures will contain provisions that will restrict the Notes from being offered, sold or otherwise transferred except pursuant to the exemptions available pursuant to Rule 144A and Regulation S, or other exceptions under the U.S. Securities Act. Furthermore, we have not registered the Notes under any other country’s 45 ----- securities laws. It is your obligation to ensure that your offers and sales of the Notes within the United States and other countries comply with applicable securities laws.

The common depositary (or its nominee) for Euroclear and Clearstream will be the sole registered holder of the Global Notes. Payments of principal, interest and other amounts owing on or in respect of the relevant Global Notes representing the Notes will be made to Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, as paying agent, which will make payments to the common depositary, who will then make payments to Euroclear and Clearstream. Thereafter, these payments will be credited to participants’ accounts that hold book-entry interests in the Global Notes representing the Notes and credited by such participants to indirect participants. After payment to the common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, none of the Issuer, the Guarantors, the Trustee or the Paying Agent will have any responsibility or liability for the payment of interest, principal or other amounts to the owners of book-entry interests. Accordingly, if you own a book-entry interest in the Notes, you must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream and, if you are not a participant in Euroclear and/or Clearstream, on the procedures of the participant through which you own your interest, to exercise any rights and obligations of a Holder of the Notes under the Indentures. Unlike the holders of the Notes themselves, owners of book-entry interests will not have any direct rights to act upon any solicitations for consents, requests for waivers or other actions from holders of the Notes. Instead, if you own a book-entry interest, you will be permitted to act only to the extent you have received appropriate proxies to do so from Euroclear and Clearstream or, if applicable, from a participant. There can be no assurance that procedures implemented for the granting of such proxies will be sufficient to enable you to vote on any matters or on a timely basis. Similarly, upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Indentures, unless and until the relevant Definitive Registered Notes are issued in respect of all book-entry interests, if you own a book-entry interest, you will be restricted to acting through Euroclear and Clearstream.

We have an annual production capacity of 258,000 metric tons of labels and flexible packaging and 231,000 metric tons of UWF and base paper. We are also the largest CWF manufacturer in Southern Europe, with an annual production capacity of 1,135,000 metric tons in 2015. We own and operate a 234,000 metric ton pulp mill in Spain, which provides approximately 30% of our overall pulp requirements. We have ten paper machines in seven mills located at various sites in Italy, France and Spain. In the twelve months ended March 31, 2016, our mills produced an aggregate of 298,000 metric tons of specialty papers and UWF and 1,142,000 metric tons of CWF. In addition, we operate a substantial paper distribution business that we have built organically and through the acquisitions of Malmenayde in France in 2008 and Polyedra in Italy in 2012. In the twelve months ended March 31, 2016, we distributed 535,000 metric tons of paper, of which 134,000 metric tons were produced by third parties. We plan to expand our distribution business with selected and opportunistic bolt-on acquisitions to expand our presence in other countries. For CWF, we rank first in terms of market share in France and Spain, and second in Italy, the principal markets for our products, which accounted for 17%, 13% and 16%, respectively, of our paper deliveries by volume in 2015. We also market our CWF elsewhere in Europe, including Germany (13%), the United Kingdom (8%) and other Western European countries (9%), Eastern Europe (4%), and, to a lesser extent, outside of Europe. Our mills are located in close proximity to the key commercial markets in Western Europe. These markets account for approximately 70% of demand for CWF in Europe and approximately 75% of our total sales in 2015. During the twelve months ended March 31, 2016, our revenue (consisting of sales of paper and energy) were A1,474.3 million. During the same period we had Adjusted EBITDA of A119.6 million and an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 8.1%.",N/A,as_expected,2016,557

Between 1999 and 2015, we invested approximately A1.0 billion in rebuilding our papermaking, coating and converting machines, increasing our co-generation capabilities, reducing costs, improving productivity, enhancing our information technology, implementing environmental and safety improvements and maintenance. We have reduced both our variable and fixed costs through machine modernization and various cost reduction initiatives, including the coordination of sales and marketing, and raw material purchases, and extensive internal and external benchmarking of our production processes. Additionally, we have invested in efficient energy production activities and reduction in greenhouse-gas emissions, and currently benefit from six co-generation plants with total installed capacity of 271 MW.",N/A,as_expected,2016,557
172_2,Offerings 2016.md,1152,OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW AND PROSPECTS,1152.3,Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations,1152.3.1,Cyclicality in the Paper Industry,"Our results of operations have been affected significantly by cyclicality in the paper industry. Long-term demand for paper is driven by global economic trends, demographic trends, technological developments and trends in end-user preferences. Although historically consumption of paper by end-users has increased steadily, customer demand for paper has fluctuated significantly, suggesting that customer demand is driven by a combination of end-user consumption and changes in the inventory levels that customers maintain. Profitability in the paper industry is highly sensitive to changes in prices, and industry profit cycles reflect the constantly shifting balance between supply and demand for individual products, as well as changes in inventory levels. Periods of industry-wide investment in new production capacity or significant contractions in demand due to weak economic conditions have in previous industry cycles led to decreases in product prices, often as a result of excess capacity. This cyclicality in the industry is exacerbated by the customer practice of leveraging inventory capacity, pursuant to which customers aim to build inventories in anticipation of increases in paper prices and then satisfy end-user demand from their inventories when paper prices are high. As a result, the financial performance of the industry has historically deteriorated during periods of oversupply only to improve when either demand has increased or supply has been reduced to a level that supports the implementation of price increases. In 2015, the European deliveries declined by 2.0% to 5.3 million metric tons compared to 5.4 million metric tons in 2014 and were stable compared to 2013 with European deliveries amounting 5.3 million metric tons in 2013, according to Euro-Graph. Demand for CWF fell by 2.3% in 2015, according to Euro-Graph. Germany, the UK, France, Italy and Spain are the main markets, accounting for 70% of deliveries in Europe. We estimate that the global demand for CWF industry was approximately 24 million metric tons in 2015. As a result of these challenging market conditions in the past decade, significant capacity has been closed in Europe. Between 2006 and 2015, capacity for 4.1 million metric tons has been closed, with Lecta alone accounting for approximately 350,000 metric tons of the reduced capacity. In 2014 and 2015, plant closures and restructurings were announced by European paper producers. Scheufelen, one of our competitors, announced the closure of one of its two production lines at its Oberlenningen mill in Germany in December 2014, reducing CWF production capacity by 160,000 metric tons per year. Sappi, another one of our competitors, announced the closure of its Nijmegen mill in the Netherlands in January 2015, reducing CWF production capacity by 240,000 metric tons per year. Arjowiggins, another of our competitors, announced the closure of its Wizernes mill in France in June 2015, reducing CWF production capacity by 140,000 metric tons per year. These closures, totaling approximately 540,000 metric tons per year of capacity, represent approximately 7% of the total Western European CWF production capacity in 2014. In addition, there have been a number of announcements of progressive capacity reductions, such as those in Metsa Husum (Sweden). We estimate that five producers of CWF (Sappi (24%), UPM (18%), Lecta (17%), Stora Enso (16%) and Burgo (12%)) currently account for approximately 87% of the European CWF production capacity. We believe that paper producers will continue to pursue a strategy of capacity rationalization, closing down less-efficient, high-cost mills, if required.",N/A,as_expected,2016,557
172_2,Offerings 2016.md,1152,OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW AND PROSPECTS,1152.3,Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations,1152.3.2,Raw Materials and Energy Costs,"Pulp and energy represent our primary input costs. Wood pulp is the principal raw material required to manufacture paper. We purchase approximately 70% of our pulp requirements, producing 52 ----- the remainder of our needs at our pulp mill in Spain. The price of pulp is highly volatile and sensitive to changes in wood prices, industry capacity, producer inventories, demand for paper, and cyclical changes in the world economy and fluctuations in the U.S. dollar, the reference currency for trading in wood pulp. Fluctuations in pulp prices may impact, in turn, prices of final paper products. Energy is also an important input cost for manufacturing paper and related transport costs. The price of crude oil impacts oil-based raw materials and transportation costs. During the period under review, the price of crude oil has been highly volatile. Moreover, we have a limited ability to pass through pulp price increases to our customers. In addition, changes in Spanish energy legislation in 2013 and 2014 had a significant impact on our results of operations. For more information, see ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Regulatory changes have affected our business historically and any future changes may have an adverse effect on our electricity generating activities.’’ For internal reporting purposes we account for revenue derived from the sale of excess electricity and from the sale of hot water as a reduction of our total energy bill.",N/A,as_expected,2016,557
172_2,Offerings 2016.md,1152,OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW AND PROSPECTS,1152.3,Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations,1152.3.3,Cost-Savings Measures and Efficiency of Operations,"Paper producers have a high proportion of fixed costs, and as a result, fluctuations in prices and volumes for paper products cause corresponding fluctuations in the profitability of paper manufacturers. As the paper industry is highly competitive, paper producers must focus on achieving greater efficiency and cost control to improve their competitive positions. To that end, we have undertaken a number of cost-savings measures in recent years, such as investing in the modernization of our paper machines and sharing best practices among our mills to enhance the efficiency of our production by reducing our fixed costs. We reduced overall labor costs by 7% between 2013 and 2015, primarily as a result of an overall reduction in headcount by approximately 14%. These actions were achieved through the following measures: - _Operational integration of Garda, Condat and Torraspapel: The integration helped to reduce the Group’s subsidiaries’ production, logistics and distribution costs while allowing the Group to achieve market growth by adapting to market evolution and strengthening its relationships with customers. - _Significant production reorganization: Production was significantly reorganized through targeted headcount reductions, mill restructuring and closures, CWF production homogenization, the interchangeability of production among different mills and investment in co-generation with the aim of reducing energy dependency on third parties. In 2013, we closed Condat’s production line n�6 in France (which had a CWF production capacity of 130,000 metric tons) and in January 2014, we closed the Berrobi-Uranga mill (which had a paper production capacity of 27,000 metric tons) and the Sarri`a de Ter mill and its co-generation plant (which had a paper production capacity of 65,000 metric tons and 25 MW of power, respectively). Moreover, Lecta converted 60,000 metric tons of CWF capacity in Motril and Zaragoza toward the production of 1-side coated and base paper. - _Optimization of our activities: In 2013, we outsourced the transportation activity of our distributor in France in order to turn fixed costs into variable costs and closed three distribution warehouses in Italy. In 2014, we further restructured our distribution business with the closure of one warehouse in France. In 2015, we outsourced the non-core activities of the Sant Joan mill. - _Optimization of sales organization: This included the full integration of Garda, Condat and Torraspapel and the centralization and merger of sales offices. - _Resource efficiency at operational sites: We reuse the paper waste generated during the production process in our mills. - _Implementation of performance based compensation: To reduce labor costs, we introduced partial variable salaries indexed to performance of the company at Cartiere del Garda. Further group-wide alignment of employee incentives and reduction in fixed labor costs was achieved by linking bonuses to EBITDA. 53 -----",N/A,as_expected,2016,557

As such, all other things being equal, a weakening of the U.S. dollar by 1% should have a positive impact on our EBITDA of A1.6 million. However, the U.S. dollar price of pulp and the euro price of paper are correlated to the U.S. dollar such that in the long run, a weakening of the U.S. dollar exerts downward pressure on euro paper prices and upward pressure on pulp prices.

This increase was attributable to lower net energy, distribution, labor and overhead costs, as a result of higher unit gross margin but was partially offset by lower sales volumes of paper and higher costs of packaging materials, outsourcing, selling variable, maintenance and production consumables costs. _Depreciation and Amortization_ Depreciation and amortization decreased by A0.5 million, or 4%, from A14.1 million in the three months ended March 31, 2015 to A13.6 million in the three months ended March 31, 2016. _Non-Recurring Items_ In the three months ended March 31, 2015 and March 31, 2016 we recorded non-recurring charges of A1.2 million and A2.1 million, respectively. These charges were due to the organization efficiency program. _Finance Costs_ Finance costs increased by A0.1 million, or 1%, from A16.7 million in the three months ended March 31, 2015 to A16.8 million in the three months ended March 31, 2016. _Income Tax_ In the three months ended March 31, 2016, we recorded an income tax charge of A1.0 million, compared to an income tax charge of A1.1 million in the three months ended March 31, 2015.",N/A,as_expected,2016,557

Such increase resulted from an increase in average net sales price of 24A/t, or 2.8%, from 872A/t in the year ended December 31, 2014 to 896A/t in the year ended December 31, 2015 but was partially offset by lower sales volumes of 36,543 metric tons, or 2.3%, from 1,601,737 metric tons in the year ended December 31, 2014 to 1,565,194 metric tons in the year ended December 31, 2015. Energy sales decreased by A6.3 million, or 6.7%, from A94.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2014 to A88.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2015. Such decrease resulted from lower sales volumes of 70,285 MWh, or 6.1%, from 1,159,352 MWh in the year ended December 31, 2014 to 1,089,067 MWh in the year ended December 31, 2015, and a decrease in average net sales price of 1A/MWh, or 1.2%, from A82/MWh in the year ended December 31, 2014 to 81A/MWh in the year ended December 31, 2015. Energy sales are allocated between CWF and specialty papers depending on whether the energy was produced at a co-generation facility connected to a mill principally producing CWF or specialty papers. The following table presents revenue by geographical location from external customers of our products and services for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015: _Raw Materials and Consumables Used_ The costs of raw materials and consumables used increased by A18.1 million, or 2.5%, from A735.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2014 to A753.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2015. As a percentage of revenue, such costs increased from 49.3% in the year ended December 31, 2014 to 50.5% in the year ended December 31, 2015. Although lower volumes raw materials and consumables were purchased, the absolute increase was attributable to an increase in the average purchase price of pulp of A84/t from the year ended December 31, 2014 to in the year ended December 31, 2015. _Labor Costs_ Labor costs decreased by A10.0 million, or 4.9%, from A203.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2014 to A193.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2015, and, as a percentage of revenue, they decreased from 13.6% in the year ended December 31, 2014 to 13.0% in the year ended December 31, 2015. The absolute decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in the average headcount of 287 employees from 3,650 employees in the year ended December 31, 2014 to 3,363 employees in the year ended December 31, 2015. 59 ----- _Other Operating Costs Except Non-Recurring Items_ Other operating costs except non-recurring items decreased by A8.9 million, or 2.0%, from A443.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2014 to A434.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2015, and, as a percentage of revenue, they decreased from 29.8% in the year ended December 31, 2014 to 29.2% in the year ended December 31, 2015. The absolute decrease was mainly due to lower energy, packaging materials, variable selling and production consumables costs, partially offset by higher outsourcing, distribution, maintenance and overhead costs. _EBITDA_ EBITDA increased by A9.3 million, or 9.3%, from A100.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2014 to A109.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2015. This increase was attributable to lower net energy costs, costs of packaging materials, sales, variable, labor and production consumables, offset by lower sales of paper in volume, higher outsourcing, distribution, maintenance and overheads costs, leading to a lower unit gross margin. EBITDA in the year ended December 31, 2015 was adversely affected by the bankruptcy of three subsidiaries of one of our major customers during 2015, the impact of which management, taking into account the protective measures put in place, estimated at A6.5 million. _Depreciation and Amortization_ Depreciation and amortization decreased by A3.1 million, or 5.2%, from A59.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2014 to A56.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2015. _Non-Recurring Items_ In the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded a non-recurring charge of A3.1 million. This was due to a A9.0 million organization efficiency program charge, partially offset by a capital gain of A5.9 million on the sale of tangible assets. In the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded a non-recurring charge of A11.5 million attributable to restructuring cash costs of A14.1 million, partially offset by a reversal of tangible assets impairment of A3.9 million. _Finance Costs_ Finance costs decreased by A0.5 million, or 0.6%, from A68.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2014 to A67.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2015. _Income Tax_ In the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded an income tax charge of A3.6 million, compared to A27.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2014.",N/A,as_expected,2016,557

This decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease of A69.9 million, or 5%, in sales of CWF, Specialties and Trading goods, from A1,465.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2013 to A1,395.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2014. Such decrease resulted from lower sales volumes of 53,149 metric tons, or 3%, from 1,654,886 metric tons in the year ended December 31, 2013 to 1,601,737 metric tons in the year ended December 31, 2014, and a decrease in average net sales price of 14A/t, or 2%, from 886A/t in the year ended December 31, 2013 to 872A/t in the year ended December 31, 2014.

The following table presents revenue by geographical location from external customers of our products and services for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2014: _Raw Materials and Consumables Used_ The costs of raw materials and consumables used decreased by A45.5 million, or 6%, from A780.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2013 to A735.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2014. As a percentage of revenue, such costs remained largely stable at 49.2% in the year ended December 31, 2013 and 49.3% in the year ended December 31, 2014. The absolute decrease was attributable to lower purchased volumes, and a decrease in the average consumption price of pulp of 31A/t from the year ended December 31, 2013 to the year ended December 31, 2014. _Labor Costs_ Labor costs decreased by A3.9 million, or 2%, from A207.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2013 to A203.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2014, but, as a percentage of revenue, they increased from 13.1% in the year ended December 31, 2013 to 13.6% in the year ended December 31, 2014. The absolute decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in the average headcount of 281 employees from 3,931 employees in the year December 31, 2013 to 3,650 employees in the year December 31, 2014, partially offset by a one-off reduction for the provision for defined benefit post-employment plans of A9.5 million booked in September 2013, following the termination of the Progil pension regime to active employees and the reduction of the provision for Retirement plan IFC, both in Condat S.A.S. _Other Operating Costs Excluding Non-Recurring Items_ Other operating costs except non-recurring items decreased by A49.1 million, or 10%, from A492.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2013 to A443.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2014, and, as a percentage of revenue, they decreased from 31.1% in the year ended December 31, 2013 to 29.8% in the year ended December 31, 2014. The absolute decrease was mainly due to lower costs of energy, packaging materials, outsourcing, distribution, variable selling, maintenance, production consumables and overhead costs in 2014 compared to 2013. _EBITDA_ EBITDA increased by A10.1 million, or 11.2%, from A90.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2013 to A100.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2014. This increase was attributable to lower costs of packaging materials, outsourcing, distribution, variable selling, labor, maintenance, production consumables and administration overheads, offset by lower sales of paper in volume and higher net energy costs, in a context of lower unit gross margin. During 2013, we benefitted from a one-off reduction of A9.5 million in labor costs (resulting from the termination of the Progil pension regime to active employees and the reduction of the provision for Retirement plan IFC, both in Condat S.A.S.) in the year ended December 31, 2013. 63 ----- _Depreciation and Amortization_ Depreciation and amortization decreased by A10.1 million, or 15%, from A69.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to A59.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2014. This decrease was mainly attributable to the closure of Condat S.A.S.’s production line 6 in July 2013 and of the Berrobi / Uranga and Sarri`a de Ter plants in 2014. _Non-Recurring Items_ In the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded a non-recurring charge of A11.5 million attributable to restructuring cash costs of A14.1 million, partially offset by a reversal of tangible assets impairment of A3.9 million. In the year ended December 31, 2013, we recorded non-recurring charge of A50.4 million, related to a tangible assets impairment of A30.0 million, restructuring cash costs of A16.9 million and a A2.5 million capital loss resulting from the sale of Torraspapel Argentina SA. _Finance Costs_ Finance costs were relatively stable at A68.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2013 and A68.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2014 but, as a percentage of revenue, they increased from 4.3% in the year ended December 31, 2013 to 4.6% in the year ended December 31, 2014. _Income Tax_ In the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded an income tax charge of A27.8 million, compared to A15.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2013.",N/A,as_expected,2016,557

172_2,Offerings 2016.md,1129,INDUSTRY AND MARKET OVERVIEW,1129.1,Specialty Papers,1129.1.1,,"Specialty paper markets are typically characterized by value added products and high margins. These markets are served by a relatively small number of competitors, who compete on the basis of brand, quality and service. The specialty papers business encompasses a wide range of products aimed at more diverse markets and smaller volume applications than CWF. The following is an overview of the principal types of specialty papers that we produce: Self-Adhesive._ Self-adhesive paper has a self-adhesive coating on one side and a surface suitable for printing on the other. Self-adhesive paper is used primarily for printing labels for a broad range of resilient, consumer facing end-uses, including food, beverage, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics. Increased use of labels is being driven by new consumption habits and regulatory changes such as food safety and legislation requiring larger labels and relabeling of existing products, the rise of pre-cooked and pre-labelled meals at supermarkets, and the increase of variable information labels driven by Internet purchases. According to FINAT, demand for self-adhesive paper in Europe grew at a CAGR of 3.3% from 2010 to 2015. According to Alexander Watson Associates (AWA), the CAGR 2014-2019 in Europe of the pressure-sensitive label market is estimated to be around 2.6%. The European self-adhesive paper market is relatively consolidated, with a small number of competitors representing a significant portion of production capacity. We estimate that, in 2015, the top five European producers of self-adhesive paper accounted for approximately 79% of European self-adhesive paper production capacity, with Lecta having the sixth largest capacity. Metalized._ Metalized paper has a thick deposit of metalized particles that resemble a layer of foil. Metalized paper offers reduced stiffness and increased flexibility and is used for labels, cigarette packets, luxury packaging, gift wrapping and self-adhesive labels. Demand for metalized paper is strongly linked to beer and tobacco demand. While tobacco consumption is decreasing in developed countries, opportunities exist in developing countries as well as in the substitution of aluminum foil. Expectations are positive for continued growth in beer demand, with metalized paper being used to differentiate premium and super premium brands from mainstream brands. In addition, the share of metalized papers in flexible and FMCG packaging is currently limited and is an opportunity for growth. We estimate that, in 2015, the top five European producers of metalized paper accounted for approximately 76% of European metalized paper production, with Lecta having the third largest capacity. 1-side coated._ 1-side coated is a wood free or recycled content paper with a pigmented coating on one side, designed primarily for conventional printing or digital printing where the paper typically takes no role in image formation. The largest end-use application for 1-side coated in Europe is flexible packaging (in the form of bags, pouches, sachets and specialty envelopes) accounting for approximately 34% of demand in 2014, according to AWA. Flexible packaging demand is expected to continue to grow, driven by changing life styles with a focus on speed and convenience which means more ready-made and pre-prepared food. Relative to other specialty paper products, the production of 1-side coated in Europe is a more fragmented market. We estimate that the top five European producers of 1-side coated account for approximately 51% of European 1-side coated production capacity, with Lecta having the fourth largest capacity. 74 ----- Thermal._ Thermal paper is a copy paper which uses heat to produce its image. Thermal technology is cost-efficient, very versatile and used in a wide range of end-use segments (e.g., logistics, medical, tickets, point-of-sale machines, etc.). The evolution of thermal paper demand has historically been positive, driven both by (i) economic growth, which affects the level of use and activity in existing printing applications, and (ii) identification of new applications for the unique benefits of thermal technology. According to the European Thermal Paper Association statistics, the deliveries of thermal paper grew in Europe at a CAGR of approximately 3% from 2010 through 2015. We estimate that, in 2015, the top five European producers of thermal paper accounted for approximately 89% of European thermal paper production capacity, with Lecta having the fifth largest capacity. Carbonless._ Carbonless paper is an alternative to carbon paper and is typically used to make multiple copies of an original document without the use of any electronic devices. For example, carbonless paper is used for car rental contracts. Demand for carbonless paper continues to be challenged by the ongoing shift from paper to digital forms. Laves Chemie estimate that European demand for carbonless paper declined by a CAGR of approximately 9% between 2012 and 2014, while global demand fell by a CAGR of approximately 2% over the same period. We estimate that, in 2015, the top five European producers of carbonless paper accounted for approximately 93% of European carbonless paper production capacity, with Lecta having the second largest capacity. Cast-coated._ Cast-coated paper is high gloss paper typically used for prestige wet-glue labels, self-adhesive labels and wet-strength self-adhesive labels or prestige packaging. We estimate that, in 2015, the top five European producers of cast-coated paper accounted for over 95% of European cast-coated paper production capacity, with Lecta having the fourth largest capacity. UWF._ UWF paper is a wood free fine paper manufactured with chemical pulp, with good strength, high brightness and is not coated. It provides a non-glare surface suitable for reading and writing, and therefore used for digital printing such as with high speed ink jet. The largest end-use applications are printing books, teaching materials, magazines, notebooks and color pictures. According to EMGE, due to the digital trend and the fact that the UWF paper market is relatively mature, demand is expected to decrease progressively. The European industry is atomized and experienced overcapacity. In recent years, there has been a considerable reduction in production capacity and therefore we believe the market is better balanced. According to Euro-Graph, European deliveries have been relatively stable in recent years: in 2015, European deliveries amounted to A6.2 million metric tons, compared to 6.3 million metric tons in 2014 and 6.1 million metric tons in 2014. **CWF** CWF is made from chemical pulp and is coated on both sides with minerals and chemicals to increase the brightness and smoothness of the paper, allowing for higher-quality printing. It can be produced either on reels or in sheets with the majority of the demand in Western Europe being for higher-value-added sheeted paper. The finer printing qualities of CWF are a function of its weight and surface properties. Wood fiber comprises about 60% of each sheet of CWF and provides its structure and strength. A coating of minerals, primarily calcium carbonate, or marble held together with binders, is layered on top. This mineral coating gives the sheet a very smooth surface, which allows for very high printing resolution and the reproduction of small nuances of color and texture. CWF is generally used for commercial printing, magazines, brochures, annual reports, advertising materials, direct mail, inserts, flyers, supplements and art books because of its strength, printability and brightness. Because CWF is used where high reprographic quality is required, it typically serves higher-end uses and therefore commands a higher price compared to other types of non-specialty paper. In addition, since the manufacture of CWF requires a complex and demanding production process, its pricing has been less volatile relative to lower-quality paper grades. 75 ----- CWF is the highest value-added, mass-produced product in the paper industry. In 2015, approximately 7.2 million metric tons of CWF was manufactured in Western Europe, and approximately 23.9 million metric tons were produced worldwide. Traditionally European producers have exported significant volumes of CWF, primarily to North America. In 2015, CWF exports from Western Europe amounted to approximately 1.4 million metric tons. In 2015, Western European CWF demand declined by 3% to 4.8 million metric tons according to EMGE, while Western European CWF deliveries (demand plus net exports) fell by 2% to 6.6 million metric tons. Germany, the UK, France, Italy and Spain are the main markets, accounting for 70% of demand in Europe. We estimate that the global demand for CWF was approximately 23.9 million metric tons in 2015. The majority of demand for CWF in Europe is for more value added products, specifically paper that has been converted to sheets. As a result, most paper produced by paper mills needs to be converted to sheets, and in general this conversion takes place following specific customer orders. EMGE estimate that demand for sheets in 2015 represents 70% of Western European CWF demand. In 2015, sheets represented approximately 75% of our CWF production.",N/A,as_expected,2016,557

In 2014 and 2015, further plant closures and restructurings were announced by European paper producers. Scheufelen, one of our competitors, announced the closure of one of its two production lines at its Oberlenningen mill in Germany in December 2014, reducing CWF production capacity by 160,000 metric tons per year. Sappi, another one of our competitors, announced the closure of its Nijmegen mill in the Netherlands in January 2015, reducing CWF production capacity by 240,000 metric tons per year. Arjowiggins, another of our competitors, announced the closure of its Wizernes mill in France in June 2015, reducing CWF production capacity by 140,000 metric tons per year. These closures, totaling approximately 540,000 metric tons per year of capacity in aggregate, represent approximately 7% of the total Western European CWF production capacity in 2014. In addition, there have been a number of announcements of progressive capacity reductions, such as those in Metsa Husum (Sweden). Capacity reductions have improved the supply/demand balance within the European CWF market, with operating rates in European CWF mills of 94% in 2015 according to EMGE. The market is expected to remain tightly balanced in the short term as a consequence of the recent closures outlined above, with operating rates expected to remain above 90% according to EMGE. We estimate that five producers of CWF (Sappi (24%), UPM (18%), Lecta (17%), Stora Enso (16%) and Burgo (12%)) currently account for approximately 87% of the European CWF production capacity. We believe that paper producers will continue to pursue a strategy of capacity rationalization, closing down less-efficient, high-cost mills, if required, or converting capacity towards specialty production to better reflect market demand dynamics. Prior to 2011, rapid economic growth and government incentives spurred investment in the pulp and paper industry in China, driving a considerable increase in Chinese paper and board as well as CWF production capacity. This allowed China to change from a net importer to a net exporter of 76 ----- CWF, exporting mainly to Asian markets and to the United States, but also to some extent Europe. In 2011, both the United States and the European Union imposed import duties and tariffs on certain coated paper products. As a result of these duties and tariffs, imports of CWF into North America and Europe from Asia, particularly China, declined. In the case of Europe, anti-subsidy duties as high as 12% and anti-dumping duties of up to 35.1% were imposed on Chinese CWF imports such duties were to expire in May 2016. On February 12, 2016, however, five EU CWF producers, including Lecta, filed a request with the European Commission for review of these duties. On May 13, 2016, the European Commission issued a notice of initiation of an expiry review. The anti-subsidy duties and the anti-dumping duties will continue to apply pending the outcome of the review, which is expected to be completed within 15 months of the publication of the notice. The anti-dumping duties for imports into North America were due to expire in October 2015 but have remained in place while under review by the U.S. International Trade Commission. A determination by the U.S. International Trade Commission that injury is unlikely to occur to U.S. producers and workers as a result of coated paper imports into the United States from China and Indonesia could lead to the existing duties being revoked by the U.S. Department of Commerce with retroactive effect to October 2015. In January 2016, the U.S. International Trade Commission voted to conduct a full review in light of the interest shown by local U.S. industry. A determination is not expected until late 2016.",N/A,as_expected,2016,557
172_2,Offerings 2016.md,1129,INDUSTRY AND MARKET OVERVIEW,1129.3,Pulp,1129.3.1,,"Wood pulp is the principal raw material required to manufacture paper. Pulp is converted from wood by means of mechanical or chemical processes. Chemical pulp, used to manufacture CWF, is produced by cooking wood chips in solutions of caustic chemicals to separate the cellulose fibers used for pulping. There are two main types of chemical pulp: long-fiber chemical pulp, made of spruce or pine wood and used to manufacture paper requiring superior strength, such as magazine paper, and short fiber chemical pulp, made of birch, beech or eucalyptus wood and used to manufacture fine papers and boards. The price of pulp is highly volatile and sensitive to changes in industry capacity, producer inventories, the demand for paper, cyclical changes in the world economy and fluctuations in the U.S. dollar, the reference currency for trading. Fluctuations in pulp prices may, in turn, impact prices of final paper products. The major chemical pulp producing regions of the world are North America, Latin America and the Nordic countries. We currently produce approximately 30% of our pulp needs internally, with the balance purchased from the market. We believe we have access to adequate market sources for the remainder of our pulp and base paper needs. Through our partial pulp integration, we seek to maximize earnings stability by increasing production cost stability but at the same time allowing paper prices to more closely track pulp prices.",N/A,as_expected,2016,557

Paper manufacturers seek to maintain a spread between the price of pulp and the price of CWF. In the past few years, CWF prices in Western Europe have remained relatively stable, while pulp prices, as measured by the price of bleached kraft pulp, were also largely stable during 2012 to 2014, contributing to a steady spread over this period. In 2015, pulp prices increased, causing a tightening of the spread between the two. Late 2015 and early 2016 were characterized by falling oil prices which resulted in a decrease in costs for oil-based raw materials, as well as energy. These lower energy prices, combined with ongoing pulp capacity increases, particularly in Latin America, are expected to exert downward pressure on pulp prices in the near to mid-term. China is expected to face several years of transitional challenges and the outlook for 2016 and 2017 is a gentle decline in demand for paper in general. China’s imports of raw materials are also on a downward trend, contributing to the fall in oil and commodity prices as well.",N/A,as_expected,2016,557

Because smaller paper users cannot efficiently be covered by the dedicated sales personnel of a paper 77 ----- company, paper distributors sell to small printers, offices, paper and office products supply stores and other small businesses that place orders that are too small and may contain too many different product specifications for a paper producer to serve directly. Paper distributors purchase paper in larger quantities from paper producers and then generally warehouse the paper and sell it in smaller lots to these buyers. Paper distributors generally also conduct marketing and promotion activities and assume credit risks associated with sales. As CWF is extensively used by small businesses, commercial printers and offices, paper distributors are a particularly important sales channel for CWF.

172_2,Offerings 2016.md,1129,INDUSTRY AND MARKET OVERVIEW,1129.6,Competition,1129.6.1,,"Competition in the paper industry is relatively intense. Paper products are largely commodities and are subject to price competition. Due to the weight of paper, it is relatively expensive to transport. Therefore, paper producers, like Lecta, who sell their products in markets geographically close to their mills benefit from cost savings and have a competitive advantage over producers who must transport their paper long distances or through maritime or river transport. In addition, although most large industrial paper machines produce paper onto reels, most demand for CWF in Europe is for sheeted paper. As a result, most paper produced by paper mills needs to be converted to sheets, and in general this conversion takes place following specific customer orders. To reduce the delivery time of customer orders, paper manufacturers must operate converting facilities close to their principal markets. Many of our Nordic competitors incur higher transportation costs and thus are at a competitive disadvantage from having to ship reeled paper to remote converting facilities located near to customers and then ship the sheeted paper on to customers. Moreover, manufacturers who maintain converting facilities at or near their mills experience cost savings due to their ability to reuse the paper waste created from the cutting process. Brand value is also an important factor in the paper industry, which is characterized by significant loyalty among printers and end-users. Several other factors also influence a paper producer’s competitive position, including the cost of raw materials, the efficiency of mills, product quality and customer service.

These CWF markets accounted for approximately 71% of demand in Europe and accounted for approximately 68% of our total deliveries in volume in 2015. We delivered approximately 67% of our specialty papers in Europe in 2015. The strategic location of our mills allows us to keep logistics costs down, which generally account for a substantial portion of delivered costs in our industry. Our main CWF competitors in Europe with mills in Nordic countries are located much further away from our customers and therefore incur higher logistics costs. Proximity to customers also allows us to better manage inventories and to provide improved customer service by being able to more quickly respond to our customers’ needs. Although most large paper machines produce reels of paper, most demand for CWF and specialty papers in Europe is for sheeted paper, which generates higher margins. As a result, most paper produced by paper mills needs to be converted to sheets, and in general this conversion takes place following specific customer orders. To reduce the delivery time of customers’ orders, paper manufacturers must operate converting facilities close to their principal markets. As our converting facilities are situated at or near our paper mills, our ability to efficiently satisfy orders while minimizing waste provides us with a cost advantage over most of our competitors. We manufacture our CWF on seven medium-width machines, which we believe are best suited for the production of most CWF products. Since the CWF market generally demands a greater variety of basis weights and surface finishes than other types of graphic paper, these machines allow us to produce our paper in a broad range of basis weights and coated surface finishes while maintaining optimal production runs with minimal waste and downtime between runs. Owned Energy Assets Providing Supply Security._** We own and operate five co-generation plants and benefit from a sixth plant at Condat, with a total installed capacity of 271MW. We generate more electricity than we consume through our co-generation plants that produce electrical and thermal energy fueled by natural gas or biomass, thereby helping to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions and raising energy efficiency. Supply Chain Integration._** Our integration in each stage of production provides us with full visibility of the entirety of our supply chain. Our ability to source approximately 30% of our own pulp and source approximately 76% of our base paper from our mills reduces earnings volatility and increases our manufacturing flexibility with respect to CWF and specialty papers. We are able to leverage our increasing base paper integration to generate higher profit margins. As a result of such supply chain integration, we optimize inventory costs and, with the visibility provided by our sales and marketing knowledge, are able to adapt the production process to the changing market environment with full control of the production chain and thereby add value to each stage. We are integrated upstream in energy and pulp production (partially), as well as downstream via our distribution business. We believe this provides us with a marked competitive advantage over other industry participants. Well-Invested Asset Base and Efficient, Low-Cost Production._** All of our mills and paper machines were modernized through a series of investment projects between 1999 and 2015, totaling approximately A1.0 billion focused on increasing added value, continuing cost reduction and increasing environmental performance and co-generation capabilities. We have reorganized production significantly through targeted headcount reductions, mill restructuring and closures, CWF production homogenization, the interchangeability of production among different mills and investment in co-generation. We intend to continue increasing our capacity production in specialty papers. We reduced overall labor costs by 7% between 2013 and 2015, primarily as a result of an overall reduction in headcount by approximately 14%. Our CWF machines are, we believe, among the most efficient in Europe and such efficiency, combined with low logistics and converting costs, provides us with a cost advantage in our key markets. Our concerted effort to produce at low-cost is underpinned by the many cost-reduction initiatives we have successfully implemented since 2013. We harmonized the bonus scheme across the Group. At our Italian mill, we converted part of the fixed labor costs into a variable cost linked to the performance of the company. Our Italian and French distribution businesses have been restructured to outsource the transportation activity and centralize management and administrative activities. Similarly, in Spain, we have centralized the Group’s financial activities and outsourced non-core activities at one 82 ----- of our mills. We have also embarked on a continuing plan to renegotiate labor agreements with unions to align incentives towards improved company performance.

In addition, we intend to continue focusing on increasing the share of certain specialty paper products in our product mix, notably self-adhesive, metalized, 1-side coated and thermal papers, which have all experienced, and we expect will continue to experience, growing demand, and which we have been successful in growing our sales at above market rates in 2015. Our know-how of coating technologies and base papers production positions us well to develop new products for labelling and flexible packaging, in order to best exploit new market opportunities. Maintain Low-Cost Production and Achieve Further Operating Efficiencies._** We believe we are a low-cost producer of CWF largely due to our past capital investment projects and capacity rationalization, which have improved the efficiency of our machines. From 2013 through 2015, we and the other European CWF producers experienced an improvement in operating ratio (ratio of CWF deliveries over CWF production capacity) from 86% in 2013 to 94% in 2015. We seek to further improve the efficiency of all of our mills through the vigorous application of best practices, the use of up-to-date technological processes and risk management techniques, and thereby increase our cost competitiveness and margins. We continue to take steps to increase productivity as measured by metric tons produced per employee. We also measure the performance of each of our mills against internal and external benchmarks relating to operational key indicators and raw material consumption. We currently benefit from six co-generation plants with a total installed capacity of 271MW, contributing to reducing our energy costs through the sale of excess electricity. Focus on Our Customers._** We continue to focus on our core target markets of France, Italy, Spain, Germany, the UK and Portugal where we enjoy brand awareness and cost advantage over our competitors. We may seek to further enhance our customer focus by expanding our distribution capabilities, while maintaining and further developing our relationships with third-party distributors. We may also seek to expand our direct sales to end-users, and we will continue to carefully evaluate acquisitions opportunities in the distribution area that may arise from time to time. Disciplined Investment in Key Focus Areas._** We intend to continue to evaluate opportunities to optimize our asset base, with a focus on existing areas with strong potential growth, including value added specialties as well as sheeted CWF and CWF in higher grades and heavier weights. As we have done in the past, we will continue to seek out opportunities to make disciplined investment in organic growth areas, such as machinery and marketing campaigns, which we expect to result in improved margins and returns. In addition, we are initiating an upgrade of our IT systems, which we expect to complete over the next three years. Continue to Respect the Environment._** We intend to continue focusing on the sustainability of our production and comply with the highest environmental standards. We have improved and will seek to continue improving our environmental performance by reducing our CO2 emissions, water use, energy consumption and sludge sent to disposal sites. We believe that our products and practices comply with the highest social and environmental standards in the market and all our mills have met the strictest audit standards, and carry ISO 14001 and EMAS Environmental Management certifications and ISO 50001 energy management certification guaranteeing transparent and responsible environmental 83 ----- performance.

CWF is made from chemical pulp and is coated on both sides with minerals and chemicals to increase the brightness and smoothness of the paper, allowing for higher-quality printing. CWF is generally used for commercial printing, magazines, brochures, annual reports, advertising materials and art books because of its strength, printability and brightness. Because CWF is used where high reprographic quality is required and consequently serves higher-end uses, it commands a higher price compared to other types of paper. We produce our CWF with a variety of print characteristics, coatings and other features in order to meet the specific needs of customers. We are shifting our product mix towards premium-grade, heavier weight and sheeted CWF products, which generate higher margins. In addition, we engage in other activities consisting of the resale of purchased products, which amounted to 133,646 metric tons in the twelve months ended March 31, 2016 and the sale of energy, which amounted to 1,100,887 MWh in the twelve months ended March 31, 2016. 84 -----",N/A,as_expected,2016,557

We manufacture or convert specialty papers at four factories in Spain and we manufacture CWF at five factories located in Italy, France and Spain on seven CWF machines and a variety of converting, coating and finishing machines. We believe that our manufacturing facilities are in excellent operating condition and are suited for the purposes for which they are being used. All of our factories are located in close proximity to the local printing markets in Southern Europe, which provides us with a competitive advantage over our Nordic competitors in our home markets by keeping our logistics costs low. Being located near our local printing markets also allows us to perform sheet converting at our factories, which results in cost savings and improved inventory management and customer service. In contrast to our competitors who operate far from their principal markets and thus generally must perform sheet converting far from their operating facilities, our on-site converting allows us to reuse the paper waste produced in the converting process. Paper machines do not have any set lifespan but rather can be continually upgraded and modernized to change any aspect of their function, other than width of the output. As a result, we have purchased only one second hand machine since 1997, installed in Zaragoza in 2014 with a production capacity of 141,000 metric tons of base paper and UWF. Furthermore, we have invested significant amounts to upgrade our existing machines to improve quality and reduce costs. The resulting increase in capacity has allowed us to shut down our less profitable operations. The machines used at each of our facilities and the components used to upgrade our machines are manufactured by leading paper machine manufacturers. We believe that a system of medium-width machines that are modernized, specialized and of high productivity are better suited than larger, wider machines for the production of the majority of CWF products. All of our CWF machines are of medium-width, between three and five meters wide. Our CWF machines are specialized to produce particular basis weights and coated surface finishes. Annual production per machine is between 115,000 and 230,000 metric tons, depending on the type of machine. 85 ----- We have added coating steps and/or coating capacity to all of our production lines, allowing for more and thicker coating layers on our paper. In addition to improving the quality of our paper, increasing the coating layers allows for reduced pulp content, and because the additional coating layers cost less than the pulp that would be required without the additional coating layers, increasing the coating layers also reduces costs. Our papermaking machines, like those of most other large European paper manufacturers, produce reels of paper. As most demand for specialty papers and CWF in Europe is for sheeted paper, we convert approximately 75% of the paper we produce into sheets.

172_2,Offerings 2016.md,1129,INDUSTRY AND MARKET OVERVIEW,1129.26,Raw Materials,1129.26.1,Pulp,"Wood pulp is the principal raw material required to manufacture paper. Pulp is converted from wood by means of mechanical or chemical processes. Chemical pulp, used to manufacture CWF, is produced by cooking wood chips in solutions of caustic chemicals to separate the cellulose fibers used for pulping. There are two main types of chemical pulp: long-fiber chemical pulp, made of spruce or pine wood and used to manufacture paper requiring superior strength, such as magazine paper; and short-fiber chemical pulp, made of birch, beech or eucalyptus wood and used to manufacture fine papers and boards. We primarily use short-fiber chemical pulp. In Spain, we operate a 234,000 metric ton (production capacity) eucalyptus pulp mill at our paper mill in Zaragoza, which produces pulp for our mills in Spain. This pulp production represents approximately 30% of our overall pulp requirements for our CWF and specialties papermaking operations. The wood used in our pulp mill in Zaragoza comes from plantations in the Iberian Peninsula. Pulp purchased from third parties is our most significant cost, amounting to approximately 21% of our revenue in the twelve months ended March 31, 2016. We purchase our pulp primarily from leading pulp producers in Latin America, Iberia and the United States. We have annual volume agreements 87 ----- with our pulp suppliers, with the prices we pay for pulp being determined by prevailing market prices at the time we place orders with our suppliers. We believe our sources of pulp are sufficiently diversified to ensure we have sufficient pulp volumes necessary for our paper manufacturing operations. In the past, pulp prices have undergone significant fluctuations. Pulp prices are highly volatile and sensitive to changes in industry capacity, producer inventories, demand for paper, and cyclical changes in the world economy and fluctuations in the U.S. dollar, the reference currency for trading. We do not engage in hedging against fluctuations in the cost of pulp because we do not enter into long-term fixed price contracts for the sale of paper. In general, our level of vertical pulp integration is low relative to many of the paper manufacturers with which we compete. A number of our competitors have full or nearly full vertical pulp integration, where mills combine wood pulping production facilities with paper production facilities. Full vertical pulp integration is intended to avoid sharp variations in the market price of pulp. However, while full vertical pulp integration may help to stabilize costs, it does not necessarily stabilize earnings, as pulp costs remain stable but finished goods prices will vary depending on what the market will bear. We have no plans to invest in additional pulp capacity.",N/A,as_expected,2016,557

We purchase these minerals and chemicals from leading producers in Western Europe. We use a combination of open market purchases and short-term fixed price, short-term variable price and framework agreements to acquire our minerals and chemicals. In recent years there has been a general increase in the prices of most of the minerals and chemicals we purchase due to general increases in commodity prices.

Our energy policy is to secure supplies of gas, steam and electricity that are reliable, cost-effective and environmentally responsible. All of our mills have energy management systems in place that are presently certified to the 50001 Standard of the International Organization for standardization guaranteeing efficient and responsible energy performance. We operate co-generation energy plants at six of our principal mills which provide, and in many cases exceed, all of our energy needs at the mills where they are located. The co-generation plants offer an efficient way to meet our energy needs, as the excess heat generated through the production of electricity is used to make the steam we need to run our production processes. The Garda mill obtains all of its energy requirements from its own co-generation plant. In 2007, we invested in a co-generation plant in Sant Joan, Spain. The plant is 51% owned by Torraspapel and 49% owned by the Spanish Institute for Energy Diversification and Saving (Instituto para la Diversificaci´on y Ahorro de la Energia) (the ‘‘IDAE’’). The plant commenced operations in September 2011. Torraspapel currently operates four co-generation plants at Leitza, Motril, Zaragoza and Sant Joan that collectively produce enough steam to meet those mills’ annual needs. These plants sell all of the electricity they produce, which more than compensates for the electricity purchased by the Torraspapel mills. In France, since the end of the mandatory purchase regime in March 2013, Condat’s steam needs are produced from traditional boilers. In Italy, we replaced the co-generation facility we previously operated in Riva del Garda with a plant that we constructed, together with Alto Garda Servizi, the city-owned utility company. The facility was completed in December 2008. It produces both steam and electricity for the mill, and sells hot water to the local municipality. In 2015 we substituted the gas turbine with a new, upgraded model with higher energy efficiency and environmental performance. Garda has 80% ownership of the plant, with Alto Garda Servizi Teleriscaldamento S.p.A. owning the remaining 20%. 88 ----- In Spain, we closed the Cogeneraci´on del Ter SL plant (which had a power of 25MW) in December 2014. We meet our gas requirements mostly through contracts with local gas suppliers. Gas prices in Southern Europe are regulated and historically we have rarely hedged our gas costs. We may enter into arrangements in order to hedge the margin between gas purchase prices and electricity sale prices. Our steam requirements are met primarily through production from the co-generation plants we operate and also through a combination of long-term, variable price contracts with local suppliers. Paper mills require electricity and steam, making co-generation plants their ideal energy source. The physical characteristics of a co-generation plant are such that self-sufficiency in steam comes with an excess of electricity available for sale to the grid. A co-generation plant consists of a gas turbine that produces electricity through an alternator connected to it and produces steam by heating water with the turbine’s exhaust gas. Electricity is then partly used to operate different equipment in the paper mill, and the balance of electricity is sold to the grid. Steam is used to run a steam turbine, which in turn provides additional electricity, and then to dry paper in the final stages of the production process. When distance and economics permit, low enthalpy steam, otherwise dispersed into the atmosphere, is used to heat water, which is distributed to neighboring cities where it replaces fossil fuels normally used for residential heating. The high yield of co-generation plants compared with the separate production of electricity and steam, and the savings resulting from the reduction in use of fossil fuels, is the basis for various incentive plans in various countries.",N/A,as_expected,2016,557

Environmental, health and safety standards applicable to us are established by the laws of the European Union and the Member States in which we operate, standards adopted by regulatory agencies and our permits and licenses, each of which is subject to periodic and more stringent modifications and requirements. Violations of these laws, regulations or permits and licenses may result in substantial fines and penalties and orders to cease the violating operations or to conduct or pay for corrective works. In some instances, violations may also result in the suspension or revocation of permits and licenses. 90 ----- All of our mills have environmental management systems in place that are presently certified to the 14001 standard of the International Organization for Standardization, and they have each obtained registration of their environmental management systems under the European Union’s Eco-Management and Audit Scheme, or EMAS. Nevertheless the risk of environmental, health and safety infractions is inherent in our industry, and from time to time we have experienced non-compliance with such laws and regulations and may do so again in the future. We invest substantial capital resources on environmental and safety compliance. In 2015, we spent A2.9 million on capital expenditures relating to environmental and safety compliance. The most significant European Union laws that apply or are expected to apply to our mills are the Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (the ‘‘IPPC’’) Directive, now replaced by the Industrial Emissions (Directive 2010/75/EU) (the ‘‘IED’’), the Emissions Trading Scheme and laws related to the Environmental Liability Directive. _IPPC and IED_ The IPPC Directive (96/61/EC, 2008/1/EC), issued in 1996, required each Member State to unify its environmental licensing regime relating to emissions of air, soil and water. The IPPC Directive contained several key policies, including the requirement that all emission and pollution control measures be based on the best available techniques. The IPPC Directive was recast, along with six other directives, in the IED, which in turn, has been implemented in the environmental permitting legislation in France, Italy and Spain. All of our facilities have been licensed under the IPPC, now IED, licensing regime. The IED (Directive 2010/75/EU) regulates air emissions and water discharges and defines permit requirements and best available techniques (‘‘BAT’’) for pollution control. A BAT reference document for our industry was published in 2014. _Emissions Trading_ The Emissions Trading System (Directive 2003/87/EC), which is part of the European Union’s efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in accordance with the Kyoto Protocol of 1997, became effective in January 2005. Pursuant to the national laws that implement this Directive, the applicable regulator in each Member State issues a greenhouse gas permit and a limited number of allowances for the annual emission of carbon dioxide to installations that are subject to the scheme, which include our mills and co-generation facilities in France, Italy and Spain. Actual carbon dioxide emissions from installations are then audited externally each year to determine whether they meet, fall below or exceed the annual allowances. To the extent an installation’s carbon dioxide emissions exceed its annual allowances it must make up for the shortfall by purchasing allowances. Alternatively, an installation whose emissions fall below its annual allowances may sell its excess allowances, or ‘‘credits.’’ We are required to purchase the vast majority of allowances to account for emissions at our mills, which allowances are sold at auctions. We have continued to improve the efficiency of our production processes and our use of energy for those processes, including through the increased use of electricity generated locally by co-generation. In addition, in 2005 we introduced the Lecta Energy Monitoring System, which is a benchmarking and process improvement effort designed to reduce our energy consumption. We expect the requirements of the Emissions Trading System to become increasingly more stringent and therefore expect to incur additional capital expenditures or other measures (such as purchasing allowances) to comply with existing or anticipated greenhouse gas emissions limits. _Environmental Liability Directive_ The Directive on Environmental Liability with regard to the Prevention and Remedying of Environmental Damage (2004/35/EC) (the ‘‘Environmental Liability Directive’’), aims to prevent and remedy the pollution of water, damage to biodiversity and land contamination that causes serious harm to human health. Operators of activities that cause environmental damage may be required to restore the damage caused or to pay for the cleanup and restoration irrespective of their fault in causing the damage. In general, the existing legislation in France, Italy and Spain governing land or water contamination is as or more stringent than the Environmental Liability Directive. These laws may impose liability on an owner or occupier of property for investigation and remediation of soil or water 91 ----- contamination at or emanating from the property, regardless of when the contamination was caused and whether the hazardous material disposal activity that caused it was legal at the time. Some of our properties are located on land with a long history of industrial use by us and other companies before us, which has resulted in spills and other releases of hazardous materials over time. Consequently, we have incurred costs for the remediation of land, soil or water contamination in the past. The limited testing for contamination that has taken place at certain of our facilities may not be sufficient to ascertain the extent of our ongoing and future obligations with respect to contamination relating to our facilities. For example, we previously operated three landfills in the vicinity of the Condat mill and, based on the testing conducted to date, it is not possible to determine the nature and extent of contamination, if any, that will require remediation at two of them. We also operate three landfills in Spain. These landfills, along with our presently and previously operated mills and co-generation facilities in Spain, may be the subject of additional requirements for investigation and cleanup of contamination as part of our compliance with Royal Decree 9/2005.

See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—We may face high costs for compliance with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, which would reduce profit margins and earnings.’’ The national European laws regulate the waste disposal framework and place restrictions on land-filling materials in order to reduce contaminated leachate and methane emissions.

As of the date of the Indentures, all of the Company’s Subsidiaries will be ‘‘Restricted Subsidiaries.’’ However, under the circumstances described below under the definition of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, the Company will be permitted to designate certain of its Subsidiaries as ‘‘Unrestricted Subsidiaries.’’ Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants in the Indentures. Those of the Company’s Subsidiaries that are Guarantors are all Restricted Subsidiaries and, subject in each case to significant limitations under applicable law (as more specifically set out below under ‘‘—Credit enhancement—Guarantees’’), will be jointly and severally liable with respect to the Company’s obligations under the Notes. The Company is a holding company with limited assets and operates its business through its Subsidiaries. Any right of the Company and its creditors, including Holders of the Notes, to participate in the assets of any of the Company’s Subsidiaries that is not a Guarantor upon the bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization of any such Subsidiary will (except insofar as the Company has a claim against such Subsidiary for intercompany debt) be subject to the prior claims of the creditors of such Subsidiary, including but not limited to trade creditors. Claims by the Trustee against a Guarantor on behalf of the Holders of the Notes will be direct claims on that Guarantor. However, some of the Guarantors are themselves holding companies, and hence claims under a Guarantee will be structurally subordinated to the prior claims of the creditors of the Subsidiaries of such Guarantors, including but not limited to trade creditors.",N/A,as_expected,2016,557

In the event the Issuer requests quotations or rates as described above, it will provide an Officer’s Certificate to the Calculation Agent setting forth in reasonable detail the results of such requests as soon as reasonably possible after 11:00 a.m., Brussels time, on the Determination Date.

The Calculation Agent will, as soon as practicable after 11:00 a.m. (Brussels time) on each Determination Date, determine the Applicable Rate, and calculate the aggregate amount of interest payable on the Floating Rate Notes in respect of the following Interest Period (the ‘‘Interest Amount’’). The Interest Amount will be calculated by applying the Applicable Rate to the principal amount of Floating Rate Notes outstanding at the commencement of the Interest Period, multiplying each such amount by the actual number of days in the Interest Period concerned divided by 360. All percentages resulting from any of the above calculations will be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one hundred thousandth of a percentage point, with five one-millionths of a percentage point being rounded upwards (e.g., 4.876545% (or .04876545) being rounded to 4.87655% (or .0487655)). All euro amounts used in or resulting from such calculations will be rounded to the nearest euro cent (with one-half euro cent being rounded upwards). The determination of the Applicable Rate and the Interest Amount by the Calculation Agent shall, in the absence of willful default, bad faith or manifest error, be binding on all parties. The interest rate on the Floating Rate Notes will in no event be higher than the maximum rate permitted by New York law as the same may be modified by any United States law of general application.

Each Guarantee (other than the Guarantee to be provided by Polyedra S.p.A.) will be secured by certain of the assets of the Subsidiary issuing that Guarantee. Not all of the Subsidiaries of the Company will guarantee the Notes, and most of the Guarantees will be subject to significant limitations. The aggregate unconsolidated EBITDA (i.e., the sum of the EBITDA of the Company and the Guarantors without giving effect to any eliminations that would arise upon consolidation of the Company and its Subsidiaries) for the twelve months ended March 31, 2016, as reported in the respective stand-alone financial statements of the Guarantors, was A90.6 million.

In addition, each Guarantor will agree to pay any and all costs and expenses (including counsel fees and expenses) incurred by the Trustee or the Holders in enforcing any rights under the Guarantees. The Guarantee of the Notes by each Guarantor will be a general unsubordinated obligation of such Guarantor and: - will rank at least pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future Debt that is not subordinated to such guarantee; - will rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future subordinated obligations of such Guarantor; - will be secured by a security interest in favor of the Security Trustee in certain of its assets (other than the Guarantee to be provided by Polyedra S.p.A.), including shares in certain Subsidiaries, but not all assets and no real property; and - will be effectively subordinated to any existing and future Debt of such Subsidiary that is secured with assets that do not secure such guarantee, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such Debt. 116 ----- The obligations of each Guarantor under its Guarantee will be limited to an amount that can be guaranteed under applicable laws, including corporate benefit laws and financial assistance, fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer restrictions under applicable insolvency laws, and will not apply to the extent a guarantee would be illegal or unenforceable under applicable local laws. We expect that the maximum principal amounts of the Guarantees to be provided by certain of the Guarantors on the Issue Date will be limited based on the valuation of the Guarantor, and will be no less than the following amounts: Sub Lecta S.A.: aggregate principal amount of the Notes; Cartiere del Garda S.p.A.: A32.0 million; Condat Holding S.A.S.: A23.8 million; Condat S.A.S.: A23.8 million; Torraspapel S.A.: A588.2 million; and Polyedra S.p.A.: A3.0 million. To the extent Dispap S.A. provides a Guarantee subsequent to the Issue Date, we expect that the maximum aggregate principal amount of such Guarantee would be approximately A30 million, but there is no assurance that this Guarantee will be provided or that it will be up to such maximum amount. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and Our Structure—The Guarantees are significantly limited by applicable laws and are subject to certain limitations or defences’’ and Annex A hereto. The Guarantees will provide that, in the event of default in the payment of principal of or premium, if any, interest, Additional Amounts, if any, and any other payment obligations in respect of the Notes (including any obligation to repurchase the Notes), the Trustee may institute legal proceedings directly against the relevant Guarantor without first proceeding against the Company.

The Company’s rights under the Intercompany Loans will be pledged by the Company as security to the Security Trustee. In the event of a default in payment on the Notes, the Intercompany Loans assigned by the Company, Sub Lecta S.A., Torraspapel S.A. and Condat Holding S.A.S. would provide the Trustee with senior claims on behalf of the Holders of the Notes for payment directly against those Subsidiaries who received such loans. If the Permitted Reorganization takes place then up to A5 million of the Intercompany Loans from Sub Lecta S.A. to Torraspapel S.A. will be novated to Dispap S.A. Interest will accrue on the Intercompany Loans at rates at least equal to the interest rates payable on the Fixed Rate Notes and the Floating Rate Notes, respectively, with such adjustments as may be necessary to match any Additional Amounts, premium or default interest due with respect to the Fixed Rate Notes or Floating Rate Notes, as the case may be. The Intercompany Loans provide for repayments of principal in amounts and at times sufficient to enable repayments in full or in part of principal under the Fixed Rate Notes or Floating Rate Notes, as the case may be, whether at maturity, on early redemption or upon acceleration.

To the extent such entities must make payments on the Intercompany Loans, they will be dependent on dividends received from their subsidiaries, payments on intercompany loans or other distributions.

There can be no assurance that the proceeds from the sale of the Collateral would be sufficient to satisfy the obligations owed to the Holders of the Notes. By its nature, some or all of the Collateral will be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the Collateral would be able to be sold in a short period of time, if at all. The Trustee and the creditors under the New Revolving Credit Facility have, and by accepting a Note, each Holder will be deemed to have, irrevocably appointed Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch as Security Trustee to act as its security trustee under the Intercreditor Agreement, the Notes, the applicable Indenture (including the Guarantees) and the Security Documents (together, the ‘‘Finance Documents’’).

No later than 30 days after the occurrence of such Change of Control, or, at the Company’s option, at any time prior to the occurrence of such Change of Control following the public announcement thereof or if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control, notify each Holder of the Notes in accordance with the provisions set forth under ‘‘—Notices,’’ with a copy of such notice to the Trustee in writing, of the occurrence of the Change of Control. On the Change of Control Purchase Date, the Company will (if the Change of Control occurred) purchase all Notes properly tendered in the Change of Control Offer and not withdrawn in accordance with the procedures set forth in such notice. The Change of Control Offer will state, among other things, the procedures that Holders of the Notes must follow to accept the Change of Control Offer. The Indentures and the New Revolving Credit Facility will have similar provisions requiring the Company and/or borrowers under such instruments to offer to repay such instruments. No assurance can be given that the Company will have sufficient liquidity to comply with such provisions and to make the Change of Control Offers required by the Indentures. The Company will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control if (1) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indentures applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Company and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer; (2) unconditional notice of redemption has been given pursuant to the Indentures as described under ‘‘—Optional redemption’’ or all conditions to such redemption have been satisfied or waived; or (3) notice of redemption has been given pursuant to the Indentures as described under ‘‘—Redemption for changes in taxes,’’ in each case unless and until there is a default in payment of the applicable Redemption Price. The occurrence of certain of the events which would constitute a Change of Control would require mandatory prepayment of Debt outstanding under the New Revolving Credit Facility and might constitute a default under, or require prepayment of, future Debt of the Company or its Subsidiaries. The occurrence of a Change of Control would also trigger an obligation of the Company to repurchase the Notes, which may in turn lead to a default under the Notes if the Company cannot finance such a repurchase. In addition, the exercise by the Holders of the Notes of their right to require the Company 120 ----- to repurchase the Notes could cause a default under the Debt of the Company or its Subsidiaries, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Company. Finally, if a Change of Control Offer is made, there can be no assurance that the Company will have sufficient funds or other resources to pay the Change of Control Purchase Price for all the Notes that might be delivered by Holders thereof seeking to accept the Change of Control Offer. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and Our Structure—We may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance a change of control offer and certain events which might otherwise constitute a change of control may not trigger a requirement for us to repurchase the Notes if our Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio is above a certain threshold in connection with the occurrence of a Change of Control event’’ and ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and Our Structure—Our substantial indebtedness may make it difficult for us to service our debt, including the Notes, and to operate our business.’’ The Change of Control provisions described above may deter certain mergers, tender offers and other takeover attempts involving the Company and, thus, the removal of incumbent management. One of the events that constitutes a Change of Control under the Indentures is a sale, conveyance, transfer or lease of all or substantially all the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. The phrase ‘‘all or substantially all’’ is subject to judicial interpretation depending on the facts and circumstances of the subject transaction. The Indentures will be governed by New York law, and there is no established quantitative definition under New York law of ‘‘substantially all’’ the assets of a corporation. Accordingly, in certain circumstances it may be unclear whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether the Company may therefore be required to make a Change of Control Offer. If at the time of such Change of Control, the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted for trading on the Euro MTF Market of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, to the extent required by the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, the Company will notify the Luxembourg Stock Exchange that a Change of Control has occurred and any relevant details relating to such Change of Control. The Company will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the ‘‘U.S. Exchange Act’’), and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to any Change of Control Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions relating to the Change of Control Offer, the Company will comply with applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control covenant by virtue thereof.",N/A,as_expected,2016,557

172_2,Offerings 2016.md,1131,LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE GUARANTEES AND THE SECURITY INTERESTS,1131.1,European Union,1131.1.1,Insolvency,"Pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) no. 1346/2000 of May 29, 2010 on insolvency proceedings (the ‘‘EU Insolvency Regulation’’), the court that shall have jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings in relation to Lecta S.A. or any Guarantor will be the court of the Member State where the entity concerned has its ‘‘centre of main interests’’ (as that term is used in Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation). The determination of where Lecta S.A. or any Guarantor has its ‘‘centre of main interests’’ would be a question of fact on which the courts of the different EU Member States may have differing and even conflicting views. It should also be noted that no final decisions have been taken in cases that have been brought before the European Court of Justice in relation to questions of interpretation or the effects of the EU Insolvency Regulation throughout the European Union. Furthermore, ‘‘centre of main interests’’ is not a static concept and may change from time to time. Although under Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation there is a rebuttable presumption that Lecta S.A. or a Guarantor would have its ‘‘centre of main interests’’ in the Member State in which it has its registered office, Preamble 13 of the EU Insolvency Regulation states that the ‘‘centre of main interests’’ of a debtor should correspond to the place where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and ‘‘is therefore ascertainable by third parties.’’ In that respect, factors such as the place in which Lecta S.A. or a Guarantor holds board meetings, the place where Lecta S.A. or a Guarantor conducts the majority of its business and the place where the large majority of Lecta S.A.’s or a Guarantor’s creditors are established may all be relevant in the determination of the place where Lecta S.A. or a Guarantor has its ‘‘centre of main interests.’’ If the ‘‘centre of main interests’’ of Lecta S.A. or a Guarantor is and will remain located in the state in which it has its registered office, the main insolvency proceedings in respect of Lecta S.A. or a Guarantor under the EU Insolvency Regulation would be commenced in such jurisdiction and accordingly a court in such jurisdiction would be entitled to commence the types of insolvency proceedings referred to in Annex A to the EU Insolvency Regulation. Insolvency proceedings opened in one Member State under the EU Insolvency Regulation are to be recognized in other Member States (other than Denmark), although secondary proceedings may be opened in another Member State. If the ‘‘centre of main interests’’ of a debtor is in one Member State (other than Denmark) under Article 3(2) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another Member State (other than Denmark) may open ‘‘territorial proceedings’’ in the event that such debtor has an ‘‘establishment’’ in the territory of such other Member State. If a debtor does not have an establishment in any other Member State, no court of any other Member State shall have the ability to open territorial proceedings in respect of such debtor under the EU Insolvency Regulation. In the event that any of the Issuer, the Guarantors of any of their respective subsidiaries experience financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced or the outcome of such proceedings. Applicable insolvency laws may affect the enforceability of the obligations of the Issuer and of the Guarantors. 164 -----",N/A,as_expected,2016,557
172_2,Offerings 2016.md,1131,LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE GUARANTEES AND THE SECURITY INTERESTS,1131.2,France,1131.2.1,Insolvency,"The French Guarantors’ registered headquarters are in France and its center of main interest is presumed to be located in France see (—‘‘European Union’’) and therefore any main insolvency proceedings (within the meaning of the EU Insolvency Regulation) of the French Guarantors would be opened in France unless this presumption is rebutted. Under certain circumstances, French insolvency proceedings may also be opened with respect to companies that are not incorporated in France, mainly if they have their center of main interest or an establishment in France. French court-administered insolvency proceedings are either safeguard (sauvegarde), accelerated safeguard (sauvegarde acc´el´er´ee), accelerated financial safeguard (sauvegarde financi`ere acc´el´er´ee), reorganization or liquidation proceedings (redressement or liquidation judiciaire). Confidential court-assisted proceedings also exist to help the debtor restructure its indebtedness in a consensual manner (namely mandat ad hoc or conciliation proceedings). In general, French insolvency legislation favors the continuation of a business and protection of employment over the payment of creditors and could limit your ability to enforce your rights under the Notes and/or the guarantees granted by the French Guarantors and the corresponding security interests. The following is a general discussion of insolvency proceedings governed by French law for informational purposes only and does not address all the French legal considerations that may be relevant to holders of the Notes. _Grace periods_ In addition to insolvency laws discussed below, you could, like any other creditors, be subject to articles 1244-1 et seq. of the French Code civil. Pursuant to the provisions of these articles, French courts may, in any civil proceeding involving the debtor, defer or otherwise reschedule over a maximum period of two years the payment dates of payment obligations and decide that any amounts, the payment date of which is thus deferred or rescheduled, will bear interest at a rate that is lower than the contractual rate (but not lower than the legal rate as published annually by decree) or that payments made shall first be allocated to repayment of the principal rather than interest. A court order made under article 1244-1 of the French Code civil will automatically suspend any pending enforcement measures, and any contractual interest or penalty for late payment will not accrue or be due during the period ordered by the court. _Emergency procedure_ The statutory auditors of the company can request the management and the board of directors (if the French Guarantor is incorporated under the legal form of a soci´et´e anonyme) to provide an explanation as to elements which the auditors believe put the company’s existence as a going concern in jeopardy. Failing satisfactory explanations or corrective measures, the auditors can request that a shareholders’ meeting be convened. The auditors must inform the commercial court. Shareholders representing at least 5% of the share capital and the workers’ committee have similar rights. The commercial court can also itself summon the management to provide explanations on elements which the court believe put the company’s existence as a going concern in jeopardy. Pursuant to the provisions of article L. 611-2-1 of the French Code de commerce, the competent civil court (Tribunal de _Grande Instance) will also be able to exercise the emergency procedure for debtors submitted to its_ jurisdiction. _Court-assisted pre-insolvency proceedings_ A French company facing difficulties may request the opening of court-assisted pre-insolvency proceedings (mandat ad hoc or conciliation) the aim of which is to reach an agreement with the debtor’s main creditors. Mandat ad hoc and _conciliation are informal proceedings carried out under the supervision of the president of the court, which do not involve any automatic stay of the proceedings. Contractual provisions pursuant to which the opening of the court-assisted pre-insolvency proceedings, or a request thereof, change the terms of ongoing contracts (contrats en cours) by reducing the rights or increasing the obligations of the debtor shall be null and void, according to 165 ----- article L. 611-16 of the French Code de commerce. Furthermore, any clause requiring the debtor, due solely to the appointment of a _mandataire ad hoc or the opening of a conciliation procedure, to pay the fees of the creditor’s counsel in such proceedings, in excess of the proportion fixed by order of the Minister of Justice (currently: 75% of the fees), shall be deemed null and void. French law does not provide for any specific rule in respect of mandat ad hoc. In practice, mandat _ad hoc proceedings are used by debtors that are facing difficulties of an economic or financial nature_ but are not in a state of cessation of payments (cessation de paiements) (i.e., the debtor is considered in a state of cessation of payments where it is unable to pay its debts when they fall due with its liquid assets (taking into account available credit lines and existing rescheduling agreements)). They are confidential and are not limited in time. The agreement reached by the parties (if any) with the help of the court-appointed officer (mandataire ad hoc) is reported by the latter to the court but is not sanctioned by the court. The appointment of a mandataire ad hoc shall be brought to the attention of the statutory auditors, according to article L. 611-3 of the French Code de commerce. _Conciliation proceedings are available to a debtor that faces actual or foreseeable difficulties of a_ legal, economic or financial nature but which has not been insolvent for more than 45 days. The debtor petitions the commercial court for the appointment of a conciliator in charge of assisting the debtor in negotiating with all or part of its creditors and/or trade partners an agreement providing for the restructuring of its indebtedness. Conciliation proceedings are confidential and may last up to five months. During the proceedings, creditors may continue to sue individually for payment of their claims but the debtor retains the right to petition for debt rescheduling pursuant to article 1244-1 of the Code _civil. Upon its execution, the agreement reached by the parties becomes binding upon them and_ creditors may not take action against the company in respect of claims governed by the agreement. In addition, without such formalities being an obligation on the parties, the agreement can be either: - upon all parties’ request, acknowledged (constat´e) by the president of the court, which makes it immediately enforceable (ex´ecutoire); or - upon the debtor’s request, sanctioned (homologu´e) by the commercial court if (i) the debtor is not insolvent at the time or if the rescheduling agreement has the effect of putting an end to the debtor’s insolvency, (ii) if the rescheduling agreement effectively ensures that the company will survive as a going concern, and (iii) the agreement is not violating the interest of the non-signatory creditors; the judgment does not make public the terms of the agreement but discloses the guarantees and priorities (privil`eges) granted to the creditors. Where the debtor requests such sanction, the content of the agreement must be notified to the employee representatives of the debtor, in accordance with article L. 611-8-1 of the French Code de _commerce._ The debtor may request the Court to appoint the conciliator to supervise the performance of the agreement (article L. 611-8 III of the French Code de commerce). While the agreement (whether acknowledged or sanctioned) is being implemented, any individual proceedings by creditors with respect to the claims included in the agreement are suspended. Subject to the agreement having been sanctioned, creditors who have extended new credits to the debtor are privileged in future proceedings. In case of breach of the agreement, any party to the agreement can petition the Court for its termination. _Court-administered proceedings—safeguard, reorganization and liquidation proceedings_ Court-administered proceedings may be initiated: - in the event of safeguard proceedings, upon petition by the debtor only; and - in the event of judicial reorganization or liquidation, upon petition by the debtor, any creditor or the public prosecutor. The debtor may file for safeguard proceedings at any time it is facing difficulties that it cannot overcome, as long as it is not insolvent. It is required to petition for the opening of judicial reorganization proceedings (if recovery is possible) or judicial liquidation proceedings (if recovery is manifestly not possible) within 45 days of becoming insolvent. If it fails to do so, its directors and officers are subject to civil liability. 166 ----- The period from the date of the court decision commencing the proceedings (whether a safeguard or a judicial reorganization) to the date on which the court takes a decision on the outcome of the proceedings is called the observation period and may last up to 18 months. During the observation period, a court-appointed administrator, whose name can be suggested by the debtor in safeguard proceedings, investigates the business of the company. In safeguard proceedings, the administrator’s mission is limited to either supervising or assisting the debtor’s management and assisting it in preparing a safeguard plan for the company. In judicial reorganization proceedings, the administrator’s mission is usually to assist the management and to make proposals for the reorganization of the company, which proposals may include the sale of all or part of the company’s business to a third party. At the end of the observation period, if it considers that the company can survive as a going concern, the court will adopt a safeguard or reorganization plan which will entail a restructuring and/or rescheduling of debts and may entail the divestiture of some or all of the debtor’s assets and businesses (a sale of the entire business is not possible in a safeguard plan). Unlike in safeguard proceedings, at the end of the observation period of judicial reorganization proceedings and, alternatively to a reorganization plan, the court may determine that all or part of the business should be sold to purchasers who have submitted bids, in the framework of an asset sale plan (plan de cession) whereby the court orders the transfer to the purchaser of the assets, contract, and number of employees mentioned in its bid. The sale price may be significantly lower than the aggregate value of the assets, as the court takes into account the number of jobs preserved by the purchaser, which is a key objective under French insolvency law. If the court adopts a safeguard plan, a reorganization plan or a plan for the sale of the business, it can set a time period during which the assets that it deems to be essential to the continued business of the debtor may not be sold without its consent. At any time during safeguard proceedings, the court may convert such proceedings into reorganization proceedings (i) upon its own initiative, if the debtor becomes in a state of cessation of payments, or (ii) at the debtors’ request, if the approval of a safeguard plan is manifestly impossible and if the company would become insolvent should safeguard proceedings be closed. It is possible for the court-appointed administrator, the mandataire judiciaire or the public prosecutor to also request the conversion of the safeguard proceedings into reorganization proceedings where no safeguard plan can realistically be adopted. At any time during safeguard or reorganization proceedings, the court may convert such proceedings into liquidation proceedings if recovery of the debtor is manifestly impossible. If a judicial liquidation of the debtor is commenced, the court will appoint a liquidator. No maximum time period is provided by law for the duration of the judicial liquidation process. The liquidator is vested with the power to represent the debtor and perform the liquidation operations (mainly liquidate the assets and settle the liabilities, to the extent the proceeds from the liquidated assets are sufficient, in accordance with the creditors’ priority order for payment). _Creditors’ Committees and Adoption of the Safeguard or Reorganization Plan_ During the observation period, in the case of large companies (with more than 150 employees or turnover greater than A20 million) whose accounts are certified by a statutory auditor (commissaire aux _comptes) or established by a certified public accountant (expert comptable), two creditors’ committees_ (one for credit institutions having a claim against the debtor and the other for suppliers having a claim that represents more than 3% of the total amount of the claims of all the debtor’s suppliers) have to be established. To be eligible to vote, suppliers must have their claims set forth in the list provided by the debtor to the administrator as certified by the debtor’s statutory auditor. If there are any outstanding debt securities in the form of obligations (such as bonds or Notes), a general meeting gathering all holders of such debt securities will be established whether or not there are different issuances and regardless of the law applicable to those obligations (the ‘‘bondholders’ general assembly’’). The Notes constitute obligations for the purposes of a safeguard or reorganization proceeding. These two committees and the bondholders’ general assembly will be consulted on the safeguard or reorganization plan drafted by the debtor’s management during the observation period. Each member of a creditors committee or of the bondholders’ general assembly must, if applicable, inform the court-appointed administrator of the existence of any agreement relating to (i) the exercise of its vote or (ii) the full or total payment of its claim by a third party as well as of any subordination 167 ----- agreement. The court-appointed administrator shall then submit to such person a proposal for the computation of its voting rights in the creditors committee/bondholders’ general assembly. In the event of disagreement, the matter may be ruled upon by the president of the commercial court in summary proceedings at the request of the creditor or of the court-appointed administrator. Creditors whose repayment schedule is not modified by the plan, or for which the plan provides for a payment of their claims in cash in full as soon as the plan is adopted or as soon as their claims are admitted, do not need to be consulted on the plan or to take part in the vote. The plan must be approved by each of the two creditors’ committees. Each committee must vote on the proposed plan within 20 to 30 days, but no earlier than 15 days, of its proposal by the company. Such approval requires the affirmative vote of creditors holding at least two-thirds of the amounts of the claims held by the members of such committee that participated in such vote. Following the approval of the plan by the two creditors’ committees, the plan will be submitted for approval to the bondholders’ general meeting. The approval of the plan at such meeting requires the affirmative vote of bondholders representing at least two-thirds of the amount of the obligations held by creditors who voted in the bondholders’ general meeting. Following approval by the creditors’ committees and the bondholders’ general meeting, the plan has to be approved (arrˆet´e) by the court. In considering such approval, the court has to verify that the interests of all creditors are sufficiently protected. Where the debtor’s situation has improved and permits, the plan supervising officer (commissaire `a l’ex´ecution du plan) shall be entitled to request that the court request amendments to the plan in favor of creditors. Once approved by the relevant court, the safeguard or reorganization plan accepted by the committees and the bondholders’ general meeting will be binding on all the members of the committees and all bondholders (including those who voted against the adoption of the plan). A safeguard or reorganization plan may include debt rescheduling and debt write-offs as well as debt-to-equity swaps. In the event any of the committees or the bondholders’ general meeting has refused to give its consent to the plan, the plan will not be approved by the court and a consultation of the creditors on an individual basis will take place. This consultation of the creditors on an individual basis also takes place if creditors’ committees have not been created. In those circumstances, the court has the right to impose unilateral debt deferrals for a maximum period of 10 years, but the court may not impose debt write-offs. The same rule applies in respect to creditors who are not members of the committees and who have not consented to the plan as adopted by the two committees and the bondholders’ general meeting. _Accelerated safeguard_ Pursuant to the French reform of pre-insolvency proceedings and insolvency proceedings on March 12, 2014, a debtor in the course of _conciliation proceedings may request commencement of accelerated safeguard proceedings. Accelerated safeguard procedure has been designed based on the model of the accelerated financial safeguard procedure discussed below, but unlike the accelerated financial safeguard, it includes non-financial creditors, such as trade creditors. To be eligible for the accelerated safeguard procedure, the debtor must fulfill the following conditions: - the debtor must be subject to ongoing conciliation proceedings when it applies for the opening of the accelerated safeguard. In this context, the debtor must have prepared a draft safeguard plan to protect its operations in the long run which is likely to be supported and to be adopted by two-thirds of its creditors; and - the debtor’s accounts must: - be certified by a statutory auditor (commissaire aux comptes) or established by a certified public accountant (expert comptable), and the debtor must have either (i) more than 20 employees, (ii) a turnover of more than A3 million (excl. VAT), or (iii) a total balance sheet above A1.5 million; or - be consolidated accounts, in accordance with the provisions of article L. 233-16 of the French Code de commerce. 168 ----- The accelerated safeguard procedure can be opened even if the debtor is in cessation of payments (cessation des paiements) provided that such cessation of payments did not arise more than 45 days prior to the date of the application for the conciliation (which is a prerequisite to the accelerated safeguard). The debtor must list the claims of each creditor who participated in the conciliation. This list is certified by (i) the statutory auditor or, where this is not possible, (ii) the accountant of the debtor and must be filed with the court by the debtor. The filing of the list with the court is considered as a claim filing on behalf of creditors if they do not declare their claims themselves. Moreover, the creditors’ representative must send to each listed creditor the extract of the list concerning such creditor’s claim. The maximum duration of the accelerated safeguard procedure (i.e. the period between the judgment opening the accelerated safeguard and the judgment adopting the plan) is three months. _Accelerated financial safeguard_ Pursuant to the banking and financial regulation law no. 2010-1249 dated 22 October 2010 (as amended by the order of 12 March 2014), a debtor in the course of conciliation proceedings may request commencement of accelerated financial safeguard proceedings. The accelerated financial safeguard procedure has been designed to ‘‘fast-track’’ purely financial difficulties of large companies (same thresholds as the accelerated safeguard procedure). The procedure relates only to debt owed to financial institutions and bondholders (i.e., debts towards credit institutions which are eligible to creditor’s committees and debts towards bondholders, which are eligible to the bondholders’ general assembly described above), which are subjected to an automatic stay and dealt with under the safeguard plan. The company continues to trade normally while the procedure is pending, thus reducing significantly the impact of a safeguard on operational companies. Other classes of creditors, such as trade creditors, are not affected by the procedure. Like the accelerated safeguard discussed above, the Accelerated Financial Safeguard procedure is available to companies which have failed to agree on a restructuring plan on a unanimous basis in the context of conciliation proceedings. To be eligible to the Accelerated Financial Safeguard, the debtor must meet the same conditions as for an accelerated safeguard procedure, and the accounts of the debtor must also show that the nature of the debts renders likely the adoption of a plan by financial creditors only. In general terms, the characteristics listed above in relation to the accelerated safeguard procedure apply to the accelerated financial safeguard procedure unless otherwise expressly indicated in the French Code of commerce (such as the duration of the proceedings). Where accelerated financial safeguard is opened, the credit institution committee and the bondholders’ general assembly are convened and are required to vote on the proposed safeguard plan within a minimum period of eight days of delivery of the proposed plan (as compared to a minimum period of 15 days for the regular safeguard or the accelerated safeguard). For their claim to be taken into account in the safeguard plan, creditors that are members of the committee of credit institutions and bondholders must file a proof of claim within two months from the publication of the judgment opening the proceedings as this is the case for regular safeguard proceedings. However, if creditor members of the committee of credit institutions and the bondholders’ general assembly do not file their claims within the above- mentioned two-month period, then (i) if they were party to the conciliation proceeding, their claims will be assumed to have been filed according to the list of claims established by the debtor and certified by its statutory auditors, which has to be provided to the court at the opening of the proceedings and (ii) if they were not party to the _conciliation proceedings, their claim will not be enforceable during the accelerated safeguard_ proceeding and will therefore not be included in the plan. The total duration of the accelerated financial safeguard (i.e., the period between the judgment opening the accelerated financial safeguard and the judgment adopting the plan) is one month, unless the court decides to extend it by one additional month. 169 ----- _Status of Creditors during Safeguard, Accelerated Financial Safeguard, Judicial Reorganization or Judicial Liquidation Proceedings_ Contractual provisions pursuant to which the opening of the proceedings constitutes an event of default are not enforceable against the debtor, while the court-appointed officer can unilaterally decide to terminate ongoing contracts (contrats en cours) which it believes the debtor will not be able to continue to perform. The court-appointed officer can, on the contrary, require that other parties to a contract continue to perform their obligations even though the debtor may have been in default, but on the condition that it fully performs its post-petition contractual obligations. In addition, during the observation period: - accrual of interest is suspended (except in respect of loans providing for a term of at least one year, or contracts providing for a payment which is differed by at least one year—however, in any event, accrued interest can no longer be compounded); - the debtor is prohibited from paying debts contracted prior to the date of the court decision commencing the proceedings, subject to specified exceptions which essentially cover the set-off of related (connexes) debts and payments authorized by the bankruptcy judge to recover assets for which recovery is justified by the continued operation of the business; and - creditors may not initiate or pursue any individual legal action against the debtor (or a guarantor of the debtor provided such guarantor is an individual—except in case of judicial liquidation) with respect to any claim arising prior to the court decision commencing the proceedings if the objective of such legal action is: - to obtain an order for payment of a sum of money by the debtor to the creditor (however, the creditor may require that a court determine the amount due); - to terminate or cancel a contract for non-payment of amounts owed by the creditor; or - to take any action against the debtor, including to enforce the creditor’s rights against any assets of the debtor. In accelerated financial safeguard, the above rules only apply to the creditors which are subject to the accelerated financial safeguard (i.e., credit institutions which are eligible to creditors’ committees and bondholders, which are eligible to the bondholders’ general assembly described above). As a general rule, creditors domiciled in France whose debts arose prior to the commencement of proceedings must file a claim with the creditors’ representative within two months of the publication of the court decision in the Bulletin Officiel des annonces civiles et commerciales; this period is extended to four months for creditors domiciled outside France. Creditors who have not submitted their claims during the relevant period are, except with respect to very limited exceptions, barred from receiving distributions made in connection with the proceedings. Employees are not subject to claim filing obligations and are preferential creditors under French law. If the court adopts a safeguard plan or reorganization plan, claims of creditors included in the plan will be paid according to the terms of the plan. The court can also set a time period during which the assets that it deems to be essential to the continued business of the debtor may not be sold without its consent. The court may also order the sale of the business (plan de cession) where the reorganization plans presented by the debtor or the creditors are obviously unlikely to allow the reorganization of the business or in the absence of any such plans (article L. 631-22 of the French Commercial Code (Code _de commerce))._ If the court adopts a plan for the sale of the business (plan de cession), the proceeds of the sale will be allocated for the repayment of the creditors according to the ranking of their claims. If the court decides to order the judicial liquidation of the debtor, the court will appoint a liquidator in charge of selling the assets of the company and settling the relevant debts in accordance with their ranking. French insolvency law assigns priority to the payment of certain preferred creditors, including employees, officials appointed by the insolvency court, creditors who, as part of the sanctioned _conciliation agreement, have provided new money or goods or services, post-petition creditors, certain_ secured creditors essentially in the event of liquidation proceedings and the French State (taxes and social charges). 170 ----- It should be pointed out that under specific circumstances, the law provides for a possibility to overcome the shareholders’ refusal to increase (and / or decrease) the company’s share capital, in the framework of reorganization proceedings, but subject to a number of restrictive conditions. _The ‘‘Hardening Period’’ in Judicial Reorganization and Liquidation Proceedings_ The court determines the date on which the debtor is deemed to have become insolvent. It can be any date within the 18 months preceding the date of the opening of the proceedings. This marks the beginning of the ‘‘hardening period’’ (p´eriode suspecte). Certain transactions entered into by the debtor during the hardening period are automatically void or voidable by the court. Automatically void transactions include, in particular, transactions or payments entered into during the suspect period that may constitute voluntary preferences for the benefit of some creditors to the detriment of other creditors. These include transfers of assets for no, or nominal, consideration, contracts under which the reciprocal obligations of the debtor significantly exceed those of the other party, payments of debts not due at the time of payment, payments made in a manner which is not commonly used in the ordinary course of business and security granted for debts (including a security granted to secure a guarantee obligation such as the guarantees) previously incurred and provisional measures, unless the right of attachment or seizure predates the date of cessation of payments. Pursuant to article L. 632-1 of the French Code de commerce, a notarized declaration of exemption of assets from seizure (d´eclaration notari´ee d’insaisissabilit´e) made by the debtor is also considered as an automatically void transaction. Transactions voidable by the court include payments made on accrued debts, transfers of assets for consideration and notices of attachments made to third parties (avis `a tiers d´etenteur), seizures (saisie_attribution) and oppositions made during the hardening period, if the court determines that the creditor knew of the insolvency of the debtor. _Creditors’ Liability_ Pursuant to article L. 650-1 of the French Code de commerce, where safeguard, judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings have been commenced, creditors may be held liable for the losses suffered as a result of facilities granted to the debtor only if the granting of such facilities was wrongful and evidence is brought either: (i) that a fraud was committed; or (ii) that there was interference of the relevant creditor with the management of the debtor; or (iii) that the security or guarantees taken to support the facilities are disproportionate to such facilities. In addition, any security or guarantees taken to support facilities in respect of which a creditor is found liable on any of these grounds can be cancelled or reduced by the court.",N/A,as_expected,2016,557

The liens on the Collateral securing the Notes may not be perfected with respect to the claims of the Notes if certain actions required to perfect any of these liens are not taken. In particular, pledges over the securities of French subsidiaries in the form a stock company (soci´et´e par actions) that are governed by French law consist of pledges over a securities account (compte-titres) in which the relevant securities are registered. The securities account pledges will be validly established after execution of a statement of pledge (d´eclaration de nantissement de compte-titres) by each relevant security provider in favor of the Trustee and/or the Security Trustee and/or the Agents. Each statement of pledge will have to be registered in the relevant shareholder’s account (compte d’actionnaire) and shares registry (registre de mouvement de titres) of each French subsidiary the securities of which are thus pledged.

Pledges over securities (whether in the form of a pledge over securities account or in the form of a pledge over shares (parts sociales)) may generally be enforced at the option of the secured creditors either (i) by way of a sale of the pledged securities in a public 171 ----- auction (the proceeds of the sale being paid to the secured creditors) or (ii) by means of a court order by way of judicial foreclosure (attribution judiciaire) or (iii) by way of contractual foreclosure (pacte _commissoire) of the pledged securities to the secured creditors, following which the secured creditors_ become the legal owner of the pledged securities. If the secured creditors choose to enforce by way of foreclosure (whether a judicial foreclosure (attribution judiciaire) or contractual foreclosure (pacte _commissoire)), the secured liabilities would be deemed extinguished up to the value of the foreclosed_ securities. Such value is determined either by a court-appointed expert in the context of a judicial attribution or by a pre-contractually agreed expert in the context of a contractual foreclosure. If the value of the Collateral exceeds the amount of secured debt, the secured creditor will be required to pay the pledgor a cash amount (soulte) equal to the difference between the value of the securities as so determined and the amount of the secured debt. This is true regardless of the actual amount of proceeds ultimately received by the secured creditor from a subsequent on-sale of the Collateral. If the value of such securities is less than the amount of the secured debt, the relevant amount owed to the relevant creditors will be reduced by an amount equal to the value of such securities, and consequently the remaining amount owed to such creditors will be unsecured in that respect.",N/A,as_expected,2016,557

In addition, if a French company receives, in return for issuing the guarantee, an economic return that is less than the economic benefit such French company would obtain in a transaction entered into on an arm’s-length basis, the difference between the actual economic benefit and that in a comparable arm’s-length transaction could be taxable under certain circumstances. _Parallel Debt_ Under French law, certain ‘‘accessory’’ security interests such as pledges require that the pledgee and the creditor of the claim secured by such security interest be the same person. Such security interests cannot be held on behalf of third parties who do not hold the secured claim, unless they act as fiduciary under article 2011 of the French Civil Code or as security agent under article 2328-1 of the French Civil Code. The beneficial holders of interests in the Notes from time to time will not be parties to the Security Documents. In order to permit the beneficial holders of the Notes to benefit from a secured claim, the Intercreditor Agreement will provide for the creation of a ‘‘parallel debt’’. Pursuant to the parallel debt, the Security Trustee becomes the holder of a claim (the ‘‘Parallel Debt’’) equal to each amount payable by an Obligor under the Indentures and the Intercreditor Agreement (the ‘‘Principal Obligations’’). The pledges governed by French law will directly secure the parallel debt, and may not directly secure the obligations under the Notes and the other indebtedness secured by the 172 ----- Collateral. The Parallel Debt will at all times be in the same amount and payable at the same time as the Principal Obligations. Any payment in respect of the Principal Obligations shall discharge the corresponding Parallel Debt and any payment in respect of the Parallel Debt shall discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. The pledges governed by French law will directly secure the Parallel Debt, and may not directly secure the obligations under the Notes and the other indebtedness secured by the Collateral. The holders of the Notes will not be entitled to take enforcement actions in respect of such security interests except through the Security Trustee (even if they are in some instances direct beneficiaries of the security interests in the Collateral). In France, the highest French judicial court (Cour de cassation), in a decision dated September 13, 2011 (n�10-25533, ‘‘Belv´ed`ere’’ case), recognized the enforceability in France of certain rights (especially the filing of claims in safeguard proceedings) of a security trustee benefiting from a parallel debt governed by New York law. In particular, the French Cour de cassation upheld the proof of claim of the legal holders of a parallel debt claim, considering that it did not contravene French international public policy (ordre public international) rules. The ruling was made on the basis that the French debtor was not exposed to double payment or artificial liability as a result of the parallel debt mechanism. The court was not asked to generally uphold French security interests securing a parallel debt. There is no assurance that the parallel debt would be recognized in each and every case by French courts or will meet such courts’ interpretation of the _Cour de cassation decision, and therefore the ability of the Security Trustee to enforce the Collateral may be restricted. To the extent that the security interests created under the parallel debt structure are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the Notes will not receive any proceeds from an enforcement of the security interest. The Trustee has certain assigned duties and rights under the Indenture that become particularly important following Defaults or Events of Default, and acts as trustee in a fiduciary capacity in the best interests of the holders of the Notes. The concept of ‘‘trust’’ has been recognized by the French Tax Code and the French supreme court (Cour de cassation), which has held, in the same published decision referred to above (Cass. com. September 13, 2011 n�10-25533 ‘‘Belv´ed`ere’’ case) that a trustee validly appointed under a trust governed by the laws of the State of New York could validly be regarded as a creditor in safeguard proceedings commenced in France. However, while substantial comfort may be derived from the above, France has not ratified the Hague Convention of July 1, 1985 on the law applicable to trusts and on their recognition, so that the concept of ‘‘trust’’ has not been generally recognized under French law. _Fraudulent conveyance_ French law contains specific provisions dealing with fraudulent conveyance both in and outside of bankruptcy, the so-called action paulienne provisions. The action paulienne offers creditors protection against a decrease in their means of recovery. A legal act performed by a person (including, without limitation, an agreement pursuant to which it guarantees the performance of the obligations of a third party or agrees to provide or provides security for any of its or a third-party’s obligations, enters into additional agreements benefiting from existing security and any other legal act having similar effect) can be challenged in or outside bankruptcy of the relevant person by the creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire), the commissioner of the safeguard or recovery plan (commissaire `a l’ex´ecution _du plan), the liquidator (liquidateur judiciaire) or by any of the creditors of the relevant debtor who was_ prejudiced in his/her means of recovery as a consequence of the act. Any such legal act may be declared unenforceable against third parties if: (i) the debtor performed such acts without an obligation to do so; (ii) the creditor concerned or, in the case of the person’s bankruptcy, any creditor, was prejudiced in its means of recovery as a consequence of the act; and (iii) at the time the legal act was performed both the debtor and the counterparty to the transaction knew or should have known that one or more of such debtor’s creditors (existing or future) would be prejudiced in their means of recovery, unless the act was entered into for no consideration (`a titre gratuit) in which case such knowledge of the counterparty is not necessary for a successful challenge on grounds of fraudulent conveyance. If a court found that the issuance of the Notes, the grant of the security interests, or the granting of a Guarantee involved a fraudulent conveyance that did not qualify for any defense under applicable law, then the issuance of the Notes, the granting of the security interests, or the granting of such Guarantee could be declared unenforceable against third parties or declared unenforceable against the creditor that lodged the claim in relation to the relevant act. As a result of such successful challenges, holders of the Notes may not enjoy the benefit of the Notes, the Guarantees or the security interests in the Collateral and the value of any consideration that holders of the Notes received with 173 ----- respect to the Notes, the security interests in the Collateral or the Guarantees could also be subject to recovery from the holders of the Notes and, possibly, from subsequent transferees. In addition, under such circumstances, holders of the Notes might be held liable for any damages incurred by prejudiced creditors of the Issuer or the Guarantors as a result of the fraudulent conveyance.",N/A,as_expected,2016,557

The insolvency laws of Italy may not be as favorable to your interests as creditors in other jurisdictions with which you may be familiar. In general, Italian creditors’ rights and insolvency laws are generally considered to be more favorable to debtors and to the trustee in bankruptcy than the regimes of certain other jurisdictions. In Italy, the courts play a central role in the insolvency process. Moreover, the enforcement of security interests by creditors in Italy can be time consuming. The following is a brief description of certain aspects of insolvency law in Italy. Certain provisions of Italian law have been amended or have entered into force only recently and, therefore, may be subject to further implementation and/or interpretations and have not been tested to date in the Italian courts. In this respect, the most recent reform has been approved by the Italian Government on 23 June 2015 through a law-decree containing urgent reforms applicable, _inter alia, to Italian bankruptcy law (the ‘‘Decree’’). The Decree entered into force on 27 June 2015 (the date of its publication in the _Gazzetta Ufficiale) and has been converted into law by Law No. 132/2015 (‘‘Law 132’’). Law 132 entered into force on 21 August 2015 after its publication in the Gazzetta _Ufficiale._ The two primary aims of Royal Decree No. 267 of March 16, 1942 (the main Italian bankruptcy legislation), as reformed and currently in force (the ‘‘Italian Bankruptcy Law’’), are to liquidate the debtor’s assets and protect the goodwill of the going concern (if any) for the satisfaction of creditors’ claims as well as, in case of the ‘‘Prodi-bis’’ procedure or ‘‘Marzano’’ procedure, to maintain employment. These competing aims have often been balanced by selling businesses as going concerns and ensuring that employees are transferred along with the businesses being sold. However, the Italian Bankruptcy Law has been recently amended with a view to promoting rescue procedures rather than liquidation, and a focus on the continuity and survival of financially distressed businesses and enhancing pre-bankruptcy restructuring options. Under the Italian Bankruptcy Law, bankruptcy must be declared by a court, based on the insolvency (insolvenza) of a company upon a petition filed by the company itself, the public prosecutor and/or one or more creditors. Insolvency occurs when a debtor is no longer able to regularly meet its obligations as they become due. This must be a permanent, and not a temporary, status of insolvency in order for a court to hold that a company is insolvent. In cases where a company is in distress, it may be possible for it to enter into out-of-court arrangements with its creditors, which may safeguard the existence of the company, but which are susceptible to being reviewed by a court in the event of a subsequent insolvency, and possibly challenged as voidable transactions. In addition, the following forms of debt restructuring and bankruptcy are available under Italian law for companies in a state of crisis and for insolvent companies.",N/A,as_expected,2016,557

The Italian Bankruptcy Law provides that, should these plans fail and the debtor be declared bankrupt, the payments and/or acts carried out for the implementation of the reorganization plan, subject to certain conditions (i) are not subject to clawback action and (ii) are exempted from certain potentially applicable criminal sanctions. Neither ratification by the court nor publication in the companies’ register are needed (although publication in the companies’ register is possible upon a debtor’s request and would allow for certain tax benefits) and, therefore, the risk of bad publicity or disvalue judgments are lower than in case of an in-court pre-bankruptcy agreement or a debt restructuring agreement.",N/A,as_expected,2016,557

An expert appointed by the debtor must assess the truthfulness of the business data provided by the company and declare that the agreement is feasible and, particularly, that it ensures that the debts of the non-participating creditors can be fully satisfied within the following time frames: (i) 120 days from the date of ratification of the agreement by the court, in the case of debts which are due and payable to the non-participating creditors as at the date of the sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement by the court; and (ii) 120 days from the date on which the relevant debts fall due, in case of receivables which are not yet due and payable to the non-participating creditors as of the date of the sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement by the court. Only a debtor who is insolvent or in a state of crisis (i.e., facing distress which does not yet amount to insolvency) can initiate this process and request the court’s sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement entered into with its creditors. The agreement is published in the companies’ register and is effective as of the day of its publication. Starting from the date of such publication and for 60 days thereafter, creditors cannot start or continue any interim relief or enforcement actions over the assets of the debtor and cannot obtain any security interest (unless agreed) in relation to pre-existing debts. Such moratorium can be requested, pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 6 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, by the debtor from the court pending negotiations with creditors (prior to the abovementioned publication of the agreement), subject to the fulfilment of certain conditions. Such moratorium request must be published in the companies’ register and becomes effective as of the date of publication. The court, having verified the completeness of the documentation, sets the date for a hearing within 30 days of the publication and orders the company to supply the relevant documentation in relation to the moratorium to the creditors. In such hearing, the court assesses whether the conditions for granting the moratorium are in place and, if they are, orders that no interim relief or enforcement action may be started or continued, nor can security interests (unless agreed) be acquired over the assets of the debtor, and sets a deadline (not exceeding 60 days) within which the restructuring agreement has to be filed. The court’s order may be challenged within 15 days of its publication. Within the same time frame, an application for the _concordato preventivo (as described below) may be filed, without prejudice to the effect of the moratorium. The Italian Bankruptcy Law does not expressly provide for any indications concerning the contents of the debt restructuring agreement. The plan can therefore provide, inter alia, either for the prosecution of the business by the debtor or by a third party, or the sale of the business to a third party and may contain, refinancing agreements, moratoria, write-offs and/or postponements of claims. The debt restructuring agreement may also contain a proposed tax settlement for the partial or deferred payment of certain taxes. Creditors and other interested parties may oppose the agreement within 30 days from the publication of the agreement in the companies’ register. The court will, after having settled the oppositions (if any), validate the agreement by issuing a decree, which may be appealed within 15 days of its publication. Pursuant to the new Article 182-quinquies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, the court, pending the sanctioning (omologazione) of the agreement pursuant to Article 182-bis, paragraph 1, or after the filing of the instance pursuant to Article 182-bis, paragraph 6, or a petition for a concordato preventivo, also pursuant to Article 161, paragraph 6, may authorize the debtor (i) to incur in new indebtedness pre-deductible pursuant to Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, provided that the expert 175 ----- appointed by the debtor, having verified the overall financial needs of the company until the sanctioning (omologazione), declares the aim of the new financial indebtedness results in a better satisfaction of the creditors, and (ii) to pay debts deriving from the supply of services or goods, already payable and due, provided that the expert declares that such payment is essential for the keeping of company’s activities and to ensure the best satisfaction for all creditors. Furthermore, Law 132 introduced a new paragraph to Article 182 quinquies which provides that debtors can apply—without the need of an expert’s certification—to the court to seek urgent court authorization to enter into ‘‘interim financing’’ agreements pre-deductible pursuant to Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law and also to continue to use existing ‘‘linee di credito autoliquidanti’’ (trade receivables credit lines). To that end, the new financings and credit lines must be functional to meet urgent needs of the business’ activities and the debtor’s application must state what use will be made of the new financings. In addition, the debtor must state that it is otherwise unable to obtain alternative financing and that, without these new financings, the business would suffer an imminent and irremediable prejudice.

Essentially, a specific regime has been established that means that even financial creditors who, although entitled to participate in negotiations, have chosen not to take part in the agreement, can be bound by the contents of a restructuring agreement, thus overcoming the need for unanimity requested by credit institutions in negotiations of financial manoeuvres. The purpose is to prevent banks with modest credits from effectively having the power to block restructuring operations involving more exposed bank creditors, resulting in the failure of the overall restructuring and the opening of a procedure.

Such composition proposal can be made by a commercial enterprise which exceeds any of the following thresholds: (i) has had assets (attivo _patrimoniale) in an aggregate amount exceeding A0.3 million for each of the three preceding fiscal_ years, (ii) gross revenues (ricavi lordi) in an aggregate amount exceeding A0.2 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years, and (iii) has total indebtedness in excess of A0.5 million. Only the debtor company can file a petition with the court for a _concordato preventivo (together with, inter alia, the proposed agreement and an independent expert report assessing the feasibility of the composition proposal and the truthfulness of the business data provided by the company). As amended by Law 132, a concordato preventivo proposal must now provide for the repayment of at least 20% of unsecured credits, although such limit does not apply if the concordato proposal relates to a ‘‘concordato with business continuity’’ (concordato con continuit`a aziendale) and, therefore, is applicable only when the _concordato is of liquidatory nature. Law 132 extends the timing requested for the homologation of _concordato preventivo procedures, which shall occur within 9 months from the filing of the request by the company. The petition for concordato preventivo is then published by the debtor in the companies’ register. From the date of such publication to the date on which the court sanctions the concordato preventivo, all enforcement and interim relief actions by the creditors (whose debt became due before the sanctioning of the concordato preventivo by the court) are stayed. During this time, all enforcement, precautionary actions and interim measures sought by the creditors, whose title arose beforehand, are stayed. Pre-existing creditors cannot obtain security interests (unless authorized by the court) and mortgages registered within the 90 days preceding the date on which the petition for the concordato _preventivo is published in the companies’ register are ineffective against such pre-existing creditors._ 176 ----- The composition proposal filed in connection with the petition may provide for: (i) the restructuring of debts and the satisfaction of creditors’ claims (including through extraordinary transactions, such as the granting to creditors and to their subsidiaries or affiliated companies of shares, bonds (including bonds convertible into shares), or other financial instruments and debt securities); (ii) the transfer to a receiver (assuntore) of the operations of the debtor company making the composition proposal (iii) the division of creditors into classes and (iv) different treatment of creditors belonging to different classes. The composition proposal may also contain a proposed tax settlement for the partial or deferred payment of certain taxes. The filing of the petition for the _concordato preventivo may be preceded by the filing of a preliminary petition for a concordato preventivo (so-called concordato in bianco, pursuant to Article 161, paragraph 6, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law). The debtor company may file such petition along with (i) its financial statements from the latest three financial years and, pursuant to the recent Italian Law Decree No. 69/2013 as converted into law No. 98/2013 (‘‘Law Decree 69/2013’’), (ii) the list of creditors with the reference to the amount of their respective receivables, reserving the right to submit the underlying plan, the proposal and all relevant documentation within a period assigned by the court between 60 and 120 days from the date of the filing of the preliminary petition, subject to only one possible further extension of up to 60 days, where there are reasonable grounds for such extension. In advance of such deadline, the debtor may also file a petition for the approval of a debt restructuring agreement (pursuant to Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law). Pursuant to Law Decree 69/2013, the court, if it accepts such preliminary petition, may (i) appoint a judicial commissioner (commissario giudiziale) to overview the company, who, in the event that the debtor has carried out one of the activities under Article 173 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law (e.g. concealment of part of assets, omission to report one or more claims, declaration of non-existent liabilities or commission of other fraudulent acts), shall report it to the court, which, upon further verification, may reject the petition at court for a _concordato preventivo and (ii) set forth reporting and information duties of the company during the above mentioned period. The debtor company may not file such pre-application if it had already done so in the previous two years without having followed by the admission to the concordato preventivo. The decree setting the term for the presentation of the documentation contains also the periodical information requirements (relating also to the financial management of the company and to the activities carried out for the purposes of the filing of the application and the restructuring plan) that the company has to fulfill, at least on a monthly basis, until the lapse of the term established by the court. The debtor company shall file, on a monthly basis, the company’s financial position, which is published, the following day, in the companies’ register. Non-compliance with these requirements results in the application for the composition with creditors being declared inadmissible and, upon request of the creditors or the public prosecutor and provided that the relevant requirements are verified, in the adjudication of the distressed company into bankruptcy. If the activities carried out by the debtor company appear to be clearly inappropriate to the preparation of the application and the restructuring plan, the court may, ex _officio, after hearing the debtor and—if appointed—the judicial commissioner, reduce the time for the_ filing of additional documents. Following the filing of the preliminary petition and until the decree of admission to the composition with creditors, the distressed company may (i) carry out acts pertaining to its ordinary activity and (ii) seek the court’s authorization to carry out acts pertaining to its extraordinary activity, to the extent they are urgent. Claims arising from acts lawfully carried out by the distressed company are treated as super senior (so-called prededucibili) pursuant to Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law and the related acts, payments and security interests granted are exempted from the clawback action provided under Article 67 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law. Law No. 9/2014 specified that the super-seniority of the claims—which arise out of loans granted with a view to allowing the filing of the preliminary petition for the composition with creditors (domanda di pre-concordato)—is granted, pursuant to Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, conditional upon the proposal, the plan and all other required documents being filed within the term set by the court and the company being admitted to the concordato preventivo within the same proceeding opened with the filing of the preliminary petition. The composition proposal may propose that (i) the debtor’s company’s business continues to be run by the debtor’s company as a going concern, or (ii) the business is transferred to one or more companies and any assets which are no longer necessary to run the business are liquidated (concordato _con continuit`a aziendale). In these cases, the petition for the concordato preventivo should fully describe_ 177 ----- the costs and revenues which are expected as a consequence of the continuation of the business as a going concern, as well as the financial resources and support which will be necessary. The report of the independent expert shall also certify that the continuation of the business is conducive to the satisfaction of creditors’ claims to a greater extent than if such composition proposal was not implemented. Furthermore, the going concern-based arrangements with creditors can provide for, inter alia, the winding-up of those assets which are not functional to the business allowed. The composition agreement may also contain a proposed tax settlement for the partial or deferred payment of certain taxes. If the court determines that the composition proposal is admissible, it appoints a judge (giudice _delegato) to supervise the procedure, appoints one or more judicial officers (commissari giudiziali) and_ calls a creditors’ meeting. During the implementation of the proposal, the company generally continues to be managed by its board of directors, but is supervised by the appointed judicial officers and judge (who shall authorize all transactions that exceed the ordinary course of business). The concordato preventivo is voted on at a creditors’ meeting and must be approved by the favorable vote of: (a) the creditors representing the majority of the receivables admitted to vote and, in the event that the plan provides for more classes of creditors also, (b) the majority of the classes. Creditors who have not voted will be deemed to approve the concordato preventivo proposal if they fail to notify their objection via telegraph, fax, mail or e-mail to such proposal within 20 days from the closure of the minutes of that creditors’ meeting. Secured creditors are not entitled to vote on the proposal of _concordato preventivo unless and to the extent they waive their security, or the concordato _preventivo provides that they will not receive full satisfaction of the fair market value of their secured_ assets (such value being assessed by an independent expert), in which case they can vote only in respect of the part of their debt affected by the proposal. The court may also approve the concordato preventivo (notwithstanding the circumstance that one or more classes objected to it) if (i) the majority of classes has approved it, and (ii) the court deems that the interests of the dissenting creditors would be adequately safeguarded through it compared to other solutions. If an opposition is filed by 20% of the creditors or, in case there are different classes of creditors, by a creditor belonging to a dissenting class, entitled to vote, by the court may nonetheless approve the concordato preventivo if it deems that the relevant creditor’s claim is likely to be satisfied no less than would otherwise be the case. In the context of a _concordato preventivo Law 132 introduces new provisions with the aim of having a more effective restructuring even through the direct involvement of creditors. This amendment includes an offer to transfer the business or any going concern or specific assets, and with respect to which the commissioner believes the offer is not in the best interest of the creditors, there is now the possibility to open a competitive auction and to present competing bids (offerte concorrenti). Moreover, creditors representing at least ten percent of the debt may present alternative creditors’ composition proposals to those of the debtor (proposte concorrenti), if the debtor’s proposal does not provide for payment of at least 40% (or 30% in relation to composition with creditors with the continuity of the going concern under Article 186-b is of the Italian Bankruptcy Law) of the unsecured receivables and such payment threshold is certified by the report issued by an independent expert in relation to the debtor’s proposal. After the approval by the creditors’ meeting, the court (having settled possible objections raised by the dissenting creditors, if any) confirms the concordato preventivo proposal by issuing a confirmation order. If the creditors’ meeting does not approve the concordato preventivo, the court may, upon request of the public prosecutor or a creditor, and having decided that the appropriate conditions apply, declare the company bankrupt. _Bankruptcy (fallimento)_ A request to declare a debtor company bankrupt and to commence bankruptcy proceedings (fallimento) and the judicial liquidation of the debtor company’s assets can be filed by the debtor company itself, any of its creditors and, in certain cases, by the public prosecutor. The bankruptcy is declared by the competent bankruptcy court. The Italian Bankruptcy Law is applicable only to commercial enterprises (imprenditori commerciali) if any of the following thresholds are met (i.e., the company has had assets (attivo patrimoniale) in an aggregate amount exceeding A0.3 million for each of 178 ----- the three preceding fiscal years, gross revenues (ricavi lordi) in an aggregate amount exceeding A0.2 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years and has total indebtedness in excess of A0.5 million). On the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings: - subject to certain exceptions, all actions of creditors are stayed and creditors must file claims within a defined period. In particular, under certain circumstances secured creditors may enforce against the secured property as soon as their claims are admitted as preferred claims. Secured claims are paid out of the proceeds of the secured assets, together with interest and expenses. Any outstanding balance will be considered unsecured and rank pari passu with all of the bankrupt’s other unsecured debt. The secured creditor may sell the secured asset only after it has obtained authorization from the designated judge (giudice delegato). After hearing the bankruptcy receiver and the creditors’ committee, the designated judge decides whether to authorize the sale, and sets forth the timing in its decision; - the administration of the debtor company and the management of its assets pass from the debtor company to the bankruptcy receiver (curatore fallimentare); - any act of the debtor company done after a declaration of bankruptcy (including payments made) is ineffective against the creditors; - continuation of business may be authorized by the court if an interruption would cause greater damage to the company, but only if the continuation of the company’s business does not cause damage to creditors; and - the execution of certain contracts and/or transactions pending as of the date of the bankruptcy declaration are suspended until the receiver decides whether to take them over. Although the general rule is that the bankruptcy receiver is allowed to either continue or terminate contracts where some or all of the obligations have not been performed by both parties, certain contracts are subject to specific rules expressly provided for by the Italian Bankruptcy Law. The bankruptcy proceedings are carried out and supervised by a court-appointed bankruptcy receiver, a deputy judge (giudice delegato) and a creditors’ committee. The bankruptcy receiver is not a representative of any one of the creditors, but is responsible for the liquidation of the assets of the debtor for the satisfaction of the creditors as a whole. The proceeds from the liquidation are distributed in accordance with statutory priority. The liquidation of a debtor can take a considerable amount of time, particularly in cases where the debtor’s assets include real property. In this respect, Law 132 amended the relevant provision of the Italian Bankruptcy Law which sets forth the requisite applicable to the liquidation procedure, which means that, the timing for the liquidation of a debtor may be shortened. The Italian Bankruptcy Law provides for a priority of payment to certain preferential creditors, including employees, the Italian treasury, and judicial and social authorities. Such priority of payment is provided under mandatory provisions of Italian law (and, as a consequence, it is untested and it is unlikely that priority of payments such as those commonly provided in intercreditor contractual arrangements would be recognized by an Italian bankruptcy estate to the extent they are inconsistent with the priorities provided by applicable law). _Bankruptcy Composition with Creditors (concordato fallimentare)_ A bankruptcy proceeding can terminate prior to liquidation through a bankruptcy composition proposal with creditors. The proposal can be filed, by one or more creditors or third parties, from the declaration of bankruptcy. By contrast, the debtor or its subsidiaries are only permitted to file such proposal after one year following such declaration, but within two years following the decree giving effectiveness to the liabilities account (stato passivo). Secured creditors are not entitled to vote on the proposal of _concordato fallimentare, unless and to the extent they waive their security or the concordato _fallimentare provides that they will not receive full satisfaction of the fair market value of their secured_ assets (such value being assessed by an independent expert), in which case they can vote only in respect of the part of their debt affected by the proposal. The proposal may provide for the division of creditors into classes (thereby proposing different treatment among the classes), the restructuring of debts and the satisfaction of creditors’ claims in any manner. The concordato fallimentare proposal must be approved by the creditors’ committee and the creditors holding the majority (by value) of claims (and, if classes are formed, also by a majority (by value) of the claims in a majority of the classes). Final court ratification is also required. 179 ----- _Statutory Priorities_ The statutory priority given to creditors under the Italian Bankruptcy Law may be different from that established in the United States, the United Kingdom and certain other EU jurisdictions. Neither the debtor nor the court can deviate from the rules of statutory priority by proposing their own priorities of claims or by subordinating one claim to another based on equitable subordination principles (as a consequence it must be noted that priority of payments such as those commonly provided in intercreditor contractual arrangements may not be enforceable against an Italian bankruptcy estate to the extent they are inconsistent with the priorities provided by law). The rules of statutory priority apply irrespective of whether the proceeds are derived from the sale of the entire bankrupt’s estate or part thereof, or from a single asset. Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law establishes that proceeds of liquidation shall be allocated according to the following order: (i) for payments of ‘‘pre-deductible’’ claims (i.e., claims originated in the insolvency proceeding, such as costs related to the procedure); (ii) for payment of claims which are privileged, such as claims of secured creditors; and (iii) for the payment of unsecured creditors’ claims. Under Italian law, the highest priority claims (after the costs of the proceedings are paid) are the claims of preferential creditors including, inter alia, a claim whose priority is legally acquired (i.e., repayment of rescue or interim financing, mentioned above), the claims of the Italian tax authorities and social security administrators, and claims for employee wages. The remaining priority claims are those of ‘‘privileged’’ creditors (creditori privilegiati; a priority in payment in most circumstances, but not exclusively, provided for by law), mortgagees (creditori ipotecari), pledgees (creditori prignoratizi) and unsecured creditors (crediti chirografari). _Avoidance Powers in Insolvency_ Under Italian law, there are ‘‘clawback’’ or avoidance provisions that may lead to, inter alia, the revocation of payments made or security interests granted by the debtor prior to the declaration of bankruptcy. The key avoidance provisions include, but are not limited to, transactions made below market value, preferential transactions and transactions made with a view to defraud creditors. Clawback rules under Italian law are normally considered to be particularly favorable to the receiver in bankruptcy, compared to the rules applicable in other jurisdictions. In bankruptcy proceedings, depending on the circumstances, the Italian Bankruptcy Law provides for a clawback period of up to either one year or six months in certain circumstances (please note that in the context of extraordinary administration procedures—see below—in relation to certain transactions the clawback period can be extended to five and three years, respectively) and a two-year ineffectiveness period for certain other transactions. The Italian Bankruptcy Law distinguishes between acts or transactions which are ineffective by operation of law and acts or transactions which are voidable at the request of the bankruptcy receiver/ court commissioner, as detailed below. a) _Acts ineffective by operation of law i. Under Article 64 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, all transactions entered into for no consideration are ineffective vis- `a-vis creditors if entered into by the debtor in the two-year period prior to the insolvency declaration; and ii. under Article 65 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, payments of debts falling due on the day of the declaration of insolvency or thereafter are deemed ineffective vis-`a-vis creditors if made by the debtor in the two-year period prior to the insolvency declaration. b) _Acts which could be declared ineffective at the request of the bankruptcy receiver/court _commissioner_ i. The following acts and transactions, if done or made during the period specified below, may be clawed back (revocati) vis-`a-vis the bankruptcy as provided for by article 67 of the above referenced Royal Decree and be declared ineffective unless the other party proves that it had no actual or constructive knowledge of the debtor’s insolvency: I. the onerous transactions entered into in the year preceding the insolvency declaration, where the value of the debt or of the obligations undertaken by the 180 ----- debtor exceeds by 25% the value of the consideration received by and/or promised to the debtor; II. payments of debts, due and payable, made by the debtor, which were not paid in cash or by other customary means of payment in the year preceding the insolvency declaration; III. pledges and mortgages granted by the bankrupt entity in the year preceding the insolvency declaration in order to secure pre-existing debts which have not yet fallen due; and IV. pledges and mortgages, granted by the bankrupt entity in the six months preceding the insolvency declaration, in order to secure debts which had fallen due. ii. The following acts and transactions, if done or made during the period specified below, may be clawed back (revocati) and declared ineffective if the bankruptcy receiver proves that the other party knew that the bankrupt entity was insolvent at the time of the act or transaction: I. the payments of debts that are immediately due and payable and any onerous transactions entered into or made in the six months preceding the insolvency declaration; and II. the granting of security interests securing debts (even those of third parties) and made in the six months preceding the insolvency declaration. iii. The following transactions are exempt from clawback actions: I. a payment for goods or services made in the ordinary course of business and in accordance with market practice; II. a remittance on a bank account, provided that it does not reduce the bankrupt entity’s debt towards the bank in a material and lasting manner; III. a sale, including an agreement for sale registered pursuant to Article 2645-bis of the Italian Civil Code, currently in force, made for a fair value and concerning a residential property that is intended as the main residence of the purchaser or the purchaser’s family (within three degrees of kinship) or a nonresidential property that is intended as the main seat of the enterprise of the purchaser, on the condition that, as at the date of the insolvency declaration, such activity is actually exercised or the investments for the start of such activity have been carried out; IV. transactions entered into, payments made and security interests granted with respect to the bankrupt entity’s goods, provided that they concern the implementation of a _piano di risanamento attestato (see ‘‘—Out-Of-Court Reorganization Plans (Piani di risanamento) Pursuant to Article 67, Paragraph 3(d) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law’’_ above); V. a transaction entered into, payment made or security interest granted to implement a _concordato preventivo (see Court-Supervised Pre-bankruptcy Composition with_ Creditors (concordato preventivo)) or an _accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti under Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law (see Debt Restructuring Agreements with Creditors (accordi di ristrutturazione dei debiti) and transactions entered into, payments made and security interests granted after the filing of the application for a _concordato preventivo (see above);_ VI. remuneration payments to the bankrupt entity’s employees and consultants; and VII. a payment of a debt that is immediately due, payable and made on the due date, with respect to services necessary for access to concordato preventivo procedures. In addition, in certain cases, the bankruptcy receiver can request that certain transactions of the bankrupt entity be declared without effect vis-`a-vis the acting creditors within the Italian Civil Code ordinary clawback period of five years (revocatoria ordinaria). Under Article 2901 of the Italian Civil Code, a creditor may demand that transactions through which the bankrupt entity disposed of its assets to the detriment of such creditor’s rights be declared ineffective with respect to such creditor, provided 181 ----- that the bankrupt entity was aware of such detriment (or, if the transaction was entered into prior to the date on which the creditor’s claim originated, that such transaction was fraudulently entered into by the debtor in order to cause detriment of such creditor’s rights) and that, in the case of a transaction entered into for consideration with a third person, the third person was aware of such detriment (or, if the transaction was entered into prior to the date on which the creditor’s claim originated, such third party participated in the fraudulent scheme). Law 132 also introduced new article 2929 bis to Italian Civil Code, providing for a ‘‘simplified’’ claw back action for the creditor in respect of certain type of transactions put in place by the debtor with the aim to subtract (registered) assets from the attachment by its creditors. In particular, the creditor can now start enforcement proceedings over the relevant assets without previously obtaining a court decision clawing back/nullifying the relevant (fraudulent) transaction, to the extent that such transaction had been carried out for no consideration (e.g. gratuitous transfers, or creation of shield instruments such as trusts or the so-called fondo patrimoniale— ‘‘family trust’’). In case of gratuitous transfers, the enforcement action can be carried out by the creditor also against the third party purchaser. _Extraordinary Administration for Large Insolvent Companies (amministrazione straordinaria delle grandi imprese in stato di insolvenza)_ An extraordinary administration procedure applies under Italian law for large industrial and commercial enterprises (the Prodi-bis procedure). The relevant company must be insolvent, but demonstrating serious recovery prospects. To qualify for this procedure, the company must have employed at least 200 employees in the previous year. In addition, it must have debts equal to at least two-thirds of its assets as shown in its financial statements and two-thirds of its income from sales and services during its last financial year. Either of the creditors, the debtor, a court or the public prosecutor may make a petition to commence an extraordinary administration procedure. The same rules set forth for bankruptcy proceedings with respect to existing contracts and creditors’ claims largely apply to extraordinary administration proceedings. There are two main phases—a ‘‘judicial phase’’ and an ‘‘administrative phase.’’ _Judicial Phase_ In the judicial phase, the court determines whether the company meets the admission criteria and whether it is insolvent. It then issues a decision to that effect and appoints up to three judicial receivers (commissiario giudiziale) to investigate whether the company has serious prospects for recovery via a business sale or reorganization. The judicial receiver files a report with the court within 30 days, and within 10 days from such filing, the Italian Productive Activities Minister (the ‘‘Ministry’’) may make an opinion on the admission of the company to the extraordinary administration procedure. The court then decides (within 30 days from the filing of the report) whether to admit the company to the procedure or to place it into bankruptcy. _Administrative Phase_ Assuming that the company is admitted to the extraordinary administration procedure, the administrative phase begins and an extraordinary commissioner (or commissioners) is appointed by the Ministry. The extraordinary commissioner(s), prepares a plan which can provide for either the sale of the business as a going concern within one year (unless extended by the Ministry) (the ‘‘Disposal Plan’’) or a reorganization leading to the company’s economic and financial recovery within two years (unless extended by the Ministry) (the ‘‘Recovery Plan’’). The plan may also include an arrangement with creditors (e.g., a debt for equity swap, an issue of shares in a new company to whom the assets of the company have been transferred, etc.) (concordato). The plan must be approved by the Ministry within 30 days from submission by the extraordinary commissioner. In addition, the extraordinary commissioner draws up a report every six months on the financial condition and interim management of the company and sends it to the Ministry. The procedure ends upon successful completion of either a Disposal Plan or a Recovery Plan, failing which the company is declared bankrupt. 182 ----- _Industrial Restructuring of Large Insolvent Companies (ristrutturazione industriale di grandi imprese in stato di insolvenza)_ Introduced in 2003, the industrial restructuring of large insolvent companies is also known as the ‘‘Marzano’’ procedure. It is complementary to the Prodi-bis procedure and, except as otherwise provided, the same provisions apply. The Marzano procedure is intended to be faster than the Prodi-bis procedure. For example, although a company must be insolvent, the application to the Ministry is made together with the filing to the court for the declaration of the insolvency of the debtor. The Marzano procedure only applies to large insolvent companies which, on a consolidated basis, have at least 500 employees in the year before the procedure is commenced and at least A300.0 million of debt. The decision whether to open a Marzano procedure is taken by the Ministry following the debtor’s request (who must also file an application for the declaration of insolvency). The Ministry assesses whether the relevant requirements are met and then appoints the extraordinary commissioner(s) who will manage the company. The court also decides on the company’s insolvency. The extraordinary commissioner(s) has/have 180 days (or 270 days if the Ministry so agrees) to submit a Disposal Plan or Recovery Plan. The restructuring through the Disposal Plan or the Recovery Plan must be completed within, respectively, one year (extendable to two years) and two years. If no Disposal or Recovery Plan is approved by the Ministry, the court will declare the company bankrupt and open bankruptcy proceedings. _Compulsory Administrative Winding-Up (liquidazione coatta amministrativa)_ A compulsory administrative winding-up (liquidazione coatta amministrativa) is only available for certain companies, including, inter alia, public interest entities such as state-controlled companies, insurance companies, credit institutions and other financial institutions, none of which can be made subject to bankruptcy proceedings. It is irrelevant whether these companies belong to the public or the private sector. A compulsory administrative winding-up is a special sort of insolvency proceeding in which the entity is liquidated not by the bankruptcy court, but by the relevant administrative authority that oversees the industry in which the entity is active. The procedure may be triggered not only by the insolvency of the relevant entity, but also on other grounds expressly provided for by the relevant legal provisions (e.g., in respect of Italian banks, serious irregularities concerning the management of the bank or serious violations of the applicable legal, administrative or statutory provisions). The effect of this procedure is that the entity loses control over its assets and a liquidator (commissario liquidatore) is appointed to wind up the company. The liquidator’s actions are monitored by a steering committee (comitato di sorveglianza). The powers assigned to the designated judge and the bankruptcy court under the other insolvency proceedings are assumed by the relevant administrative authority under this procedure. The effect on creditors of the forced administrative winding-up is largely the same as under bankruptcy proceedings and includes, for example, a ban on enforcement measures. The same rules set forth for bankruptcy proceedings with respect to existing contracts and creditors’ claims largely apply to extraordinary administration proceedings.",N/A,as_expected,2016,557

If a security interest or a guarantee is being provided in the context of an acquisition, group reorganization, refinancing or restructuring, financial assistance issues may also be triggered. _Corporate Benefit_ An Italian company entering into a transaction (including granting a security interest or a guarantee) must receive a real and adequate benefit in exchange for it. The concept of a real and adequate benefit is not specifically defined in the applicable legislation and is determined by a factual analysis on a case-by-case basis. As a general rule, corporate benefit is to be assessed at the level of the relevant company on a stand-alone basis, although upon certain circumstances and subject to specific rules the interest of the group to which such company belongs may also be taken into consideration. 183 ----- As a general rule, absence of a real and adequate corporate benefit could render the transaction (including granting a security interest or a guarantee) ultra vires and potentially affected by conflict of interest and the related corporate resolutions adopted by the shareholders and directors may be the subject matter of challenges and annulment. Civil liabilities also may be imposed on the directors of the company if it is assessed that they did not act in the interest of it and that the acts they carried out do not fall within the corporate purpose of the company or were against mandatory provisions of Italian law. The lack of corporate benefit could also lead to civil liabilities on those companies or persons ultimately exercising control over the Italian grantor or having knowingly received an advantage or profit from such improper control. Moreover, the transaction (including the security interest or guarantee granted by an Italian company) could be declared null and void if the lack of corporate benefit was known or presumed to be known by the third party and such third party acted intentionally against the interest of the company. The above principles on corporate benefit apply equally to upstream/crossstream/downstream security interest or guarantees granted by Italian companies. In relation to security interests or guarantees, while corporate benefit for a downstream security or guarantee (i.e., a security or a guarantee granted to secure financial obligations of direct or indirect subsidiaries of the relevant grantor) can usually be easily proved, the validity and effectiveness of an upstream or cross-stream security or guarantee (i.e., a security interest or a guarantee granted to secure financial obligations of the direct or indirect parent or sister companies of the relevant grantor) granted by an entity organized under the laws of Italy depend on the existence of a real and adequate benefit in exchange for the granted security interest or guarantee. The general rule is that the risk assumed by an Italian grantor of security or guarantee must not be disproportionate to the direct or indirect economic benefit to it. In particular, in case of upstream and crossstream security interests or guarantees for the financial obligations of group companies, examples may include financial consideration in the form of access to cash flows through intercompany loans from other members of that group or other economic benefit accruing to the Italian grantor in the context of the overall transaction. _Financial Assistance_ Save for specific exceptions, it is unlawful under Italian laws for a company to give financial assistance (whether by means of loans, security, guarantees or otherwise) to support the acquisition or subscription by a third party of its own shares or quotas or those of any entity that (directly or indirectly) controls the Italian company, and any loan, guarantee or security given or granted in breach of these provisions is null and void. Financial assistance to refinance indebtedness incurred by a company to purchase or subscribe for its own shares or quotes or those of its direct or indirect parent company might also be considered as falling within the scope of Italian financial assistance provisions. Subject to the foregoing, the Guarantees by any Italian Guarantor are subject to certain restrictions or limitations, including, inter alia: - the Guarantees will not secure any amounts the purpose of which is, directly or indirectly, the acquisition or the subscription in any shares in such Italian Guarantor and/or any of its direct and indirect holding companies in the context of the acquisition, in accordance with the provisions of article 2358 and/ or article 2474, as the case may be, of the Italian Civil Code; - the Guarantees will be in any case limited to, and will not exceed, the amount of any intercompany loans, or other financial support in any form, advanced to such Italian Guarantor (or any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries pursuant to article 2359, paragraph 1, numbers 1 and/or 2, of the Italian Civil Code) by any member of the Group on or after the Issue Date using the proceeds of, respectively, the Floating Rate Senior Secured Notes and the Secured Notes; and - the Guarantees will be limited to a specific maximum amount, pursuant to article 1938 of the Italian Civil Code. _Certain Limitations on Enforcement_ Under Italian law, in the event that an entity becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, guarantees and security interests given by it or by way of a parallel debt obligation could be subject to potential challenges by the appointed bankruptcy receiver or by other creditors under the rules of 184 ----- ineffectiveness or avoidance or clawback of Italian Bankruptcy Law and the relevant law on the non-insolvency avoidance or clawback of transactions made by the debtor during a certain legally specified period (the ‘‘suspect period’’). For a more detailed explanation of the terms, conditions and consequences of clawback actions in an insolvency scenario, see ‘‘—Certain Italian Insolvency Laws’’ above. If challenged successfully, the guarantee or the security interest may become unenforceable and any amounts received must be refunded to the insolvent estate. To the extent that the grant of any security interest or guarantee is voided, holders of the Notes could lose the benefit of the security interest or guarantee and may not be able to recover any amounts under the related security documents. In addition, under Italian law, in certain circumstances also in the ordinary course of business, an action can be brought by any creditor of a given debtor within five years from the date in which the latter enters into a guarantee, security, agreement and any other act by which it disposes of any of its assets, in order to seek a clawback action (azione revocatoria ordinaria) pursuant to Article 2901 of the Italian Civil Code (which results in a declaration of ineffectiveness as to the acting creditor) of the said guarantee, security, agreement and other act that is purported to be prejudicial to the acting creditor’s right of credit. An Italian court could revoke the said guarantee, security, agreement and other act only if it, in addition to the ascertainment of the prejudice, was to make the two following findings: - that the debtor was aware of the prejudice which the act would cause to the rights of the acting creditor, or, if such act was done prior to the existence of the claim or credit, that the act was fraudulently for the purpose of prejudicing the satisfaction of the claim or credit; - that, in the case of non-gratuitous act, the third party involved was aware of said prejudice and, if that act was done prior to the existence of the claim or credit, that the said third party participated in the fraudulent design. Furthermore, under fraudulent conveyance and other provisions of Italian law, a court could void or invalidate all or a portion of the obligations of a guarantor under the relevant guarantee and, if payment had already been made under that guarantee, require the recipients of that payment to return the payment to the relevant guarantor, if the court found that, inter alia: - the relevant guarantor gave such guarantee with actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud its current or future creditors or with a desire to prefer some creditors over others, or when the beneficiary of the guarantee was aware that the relevant guarantor was insolvent when it gave the relevant guarantee; - the relevant guarantor did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value for its guarantee or the relevant guarantor was insolvent at the time the guarantee was given; - the relevant guarantee was held to exceed the corporate objects of the relevant guarantor or not to be in the best interest or for the corporate benefit of the relevant guarantor; or - the guarantor giving such guarantee was aware, or should have been aware, that the transaction was to the detriment of the creditors. If a court decided either that a guarantee was a fraudulent conveyance and voided such guarantee, or held it unenforceable for any other reason, the beneficiary of the guarantee may cease to have any claim with respect to the relevant guarantor. The same would also apply to any security interest.",N/A,as_expected,2016,557
172_2,Offerings 2016.md,1131,LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE GUARANTEES AND THE SECURITY INTERESTS,1131.3,Italy,1131.3.7,Certain Considerations in Relation to Security Interests,"_Parallel Debt_ It is uncertain and untested in the Italian courts whether, under Italian law, a security interest can be created and perfected: (i) in favor of creditors (such as the holders of the Notes) which are neither directly parties to the relevant security documents or are not specifically identified therein or in the relevant share certificates and corporate documents or public registries; and (ii) in favor of a ‘‘trustee’’, since there is no established concept of ‘‘trust’’ or ‘‘trustee’’ under Italian law and the precise nature, effect and enforceability of the duties, rights and powers of a ‘‘trustee’’ as agent or trustee under security interests granted over Italian assets is uncertain under Italian law. 185 ----- Given the above and considering that the holders of the Notes are not party to the Italian law governed security documents, there is a risk that an Italian court may determine that the holders of the Notes (in relation to which the relevant perfection formalities acknowledging their status as a secured creditor are not perfected at the time of enforcement) are not secured by the security interests created under the Italian law governed security documents and/or cannot enforce that security interest. To address the above potential issue, the Intercreditor Agreement provides for the creation of a ‘‘parallel debt’’. Pursuant to the parallel debt claim and subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and to applicable law, the Security Agent, in its individual capacity acting in its own name and not as agent or representative of the holders of the Notes, shall become the holder of a claim equal to each amount payable by an obligor under the Notes. The security interests in the Notes Collateral governed by Italian law will then secure the parallel debt. However, investors should note that the enforceability of Italian law governed security interests granted in favor of the creditor of a parallel debt has not been tested before the Italian courts and, therefore, it cannot be excluded that the parallel debt will not per se eliminate or mitigate the risk of unenforceability by the holders of the Notes of the Notes Collateral securing the Notes governed by Italian law. General The procedures for the enforcement of Italian law security and the timing for obtaining judicial decisions (including in relation to security enforcement) in the Republic of Italy are materially complex and time-consuming, especially given that the Italian courts maintain a significant role in the enforcement process, in comparison to other jurisdictions with which investors may be familiar.",N/A,as_expected,2016,557
172_2,Offerings 2016.md,1131,LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE GUARANTEES AND THE SECURITY INTERESTS,1131.4,Luxembourg,1131.4.1,Insolvency,"The following is a brief description of certain aspects of insolvency law in Luxembourg. As described above, in the event that Lecta S.A. or Sub Lecta S.A. experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. Pursuant to Luxembourg insolvency laws, your ability to receive payment under the Notes may be more limited than would be the case under U.S. bankruptcy laws. Under Luxembourg law, the following types of proceedings (together referred to as ‘‘insolvency proceedings’’) may be initiated against a company having its ‘‘centre of main interests’’ (within the meaning of EU Council Regulation No. 1346/2000 of May 29, 2000 on insolvency proceedings (the ‘‘EUIR’’)) or an establishment in Luxembourg (in the latter case assuming that the centre of main interests is located in a jurisdiction where the EUIR is applicable): - bankruptcy proceedings (faillite), the opening of which may be requested by the company, by any of its creditors or by the courts ex officio. Following such a request, the Luxembourg courts having jurisdiction may open bankruptcy proceedings if the company: (i) is in a state of cessation of payments (cessation des paiements) and (ii) has lost its commercial creditworthiness (´ebranlement de cr´edit). The main effect of such proceedings is the sale of the assets and allocation of the proceeds of such sale between creditors taking into account their rank of privilege, as well as the suspension of all measures of enforcement against the company, except, subject to certain limited exceptions, for enforcement by secured creditors and the payment of the secured creditors in accordance with their rank upon realization of the assets. In addition, the managers or directors of a Luxembourg company that ceases its payments (i.e., is unable to pay its debts as they fall due with normal means of payment) must within a month of them having become aware of the company’s cessation of payments, file a petition for bankruptcy (faillite) with the court clerk of the district court of the company’s registered office. If the managers or directors fail to comply with such provision they may be held (i) liable towards the company or any third parties on the basis of principles of directors’ liability for any loss suffered and (ii) criminally liable for simple bankruptcy (banqueroute _simple) in accordance with article 573 of the Luxembourg Commercial Code._ - controlled management proceedings (gestion contrˆol´ee), the opening of which may only be requested by the company and not by its creditors and under which a Luxembourg court may 186 ----- order the provisional stay of enforcement of claims except for secured creditors (please see the below applicable provision of the law as of August 5, 2005); or - composition proceedings (concordat pr´eventif de faillite), the opening of which may only be requested by the company (subject to obtaining the consent of the majority of its creditors) and not by its creditors directly. The Luxembourg court’s decision to admit a company to composition proceedings triggers a provisional stay on enforcement of claims by creditors except for secured creditors (see the below applicable provisions of the law as of August 5, 2005). - In addition to these proceedings, your ability to receive payment on the Notes may be affected by a decision of a Luxembourg court to grant a stay on payments (sursis de paiement) or to put a Luxembourg company into judicial liquidation (liquidation judiciaire). Judicial liquidation proceedings may be opened at the request of the public prosecutor against companies pursuing an activity violating criminal laws or that are in serious breach or violation of the Luxembourg Commercial Code or of the Luxembourg laws applicable to commercial companies, as amended. The management of such liquidation proceedings will generally follow similar rules as those applicable to Luxembourg bankruptcy proceedings. Liability of the Luxembourg companies in respect of the Notes will, in the event of a liquidation of the company following bankruptcy or judicial liquidation proceedings, only rank after the cost of liquidation (including any debt incurred for the purpose of such liquidation) and any claims that are preferred under Luxembourg law. Preferential claims under Luxembourg law include, among others: - remuneration owed to employees (last six months’ wages amounting to a maximum of six times the minimum social salary); - employees’ contributions to social security; - amounts owed to the Luxembourg Revenue (including direct and indirect taxes); - the employer’s contribution to social security; - landlord, pledgor not under the Financial Collateral Law (as defined herein); and - unsecured creditors. Assets over which a security interest has been granted will in principle not be available for distribution to unsecured and unpreferred creditors (except after enforcement and to the extent a surplus is realized). More-favorable rules apply in relation to security interests of claims or financial instruments securing monetary claims (or claims for the delivery of financial instruments). In such a case, the act dated August 5, 2005 concerning financial collateral arrangements, as amended (the ‘‘Financial Collateral Law’’) applies. Article 20 of the Financial Collateral Law provides that all Luxembourg law collateral arrangements (pledges, security assignments and repo agreements) over claims and financial instruments, as well as all enforcement measures and valuation and enforcement measures agreed upon by the parties in accordance with this law, are valid and enforceable even if entered into during the preference period (periode suspecte) against third parties, commissioners, receivers, liquidators and other similar persons notwithstanding the insolvency proceedings (save in the case of fraud). Article 24 of the Financial Collateral Law provides that foreign law security interests over claims or financial instruments granted by a Luxembourg pledgor will be valid and enforceable as a matter of Luxembourg law notwithstanding any Luxembourg insolvency proceedings, if such foreign law security interests are similar in nature to a Luxembourg security interest falling within the scope of the Financial Collateral Law. If article 24 applies, Luxembourg preference period rules are disapplied (save the case of fraud). Article 21(2) of the Financial Collateral Law provides that where a financial collateral arrangement has been entered into on the day of, but after the opening of liquidation proceedings or the coming into force of reorganization measures or the entry into force of such measures, such arrangement is enforceable against third parties, administrators, insolvency receivers, liquidators and other similar persons if the collateral taker proves that it was unaware of the fact that such proceedings had been opened or that such measures had been taken or that it could not reasonably be aware of such proceedings, measures or arrangement. 187 ----- _Impact of Insolvency Proceedings on Transactions_ During such insolvency proceedings, all enforcement measures by unsecured creditors are suspended. Other than as described above, the ability of certain secured creditors to enforce their security interests may also be limited, particularly in the event of controlled management proceedings expressly providing that the rights of secured creditors will be frozen until a final decision has been taken by a Luxembourg court as to the petition for controlled management, and may be affected thereafter by a reorganization order given by the court. A reorganization order requires the prior approval by more than 50% of the creditors representing more than 50% of the relevant Luxembourg company’s liabilities in order to take effect. Furthermore, you should note that declarations of default and subsequent acceleration (such as acceleration upon the occurrence of an event of default) may not be enforceable during controlled management proceedings. Luxembourg insolvency laws may also affect transactions entered into or payments made by a Luxembourg company during the preference period (p´eriode suspecte) which is a maximum of six months plus 10 days preceding the judgment declaring bankruptcy, except that in certain specific situations the court may set the start of the suspect period at an earlier date. In particular: - pursuant to article 445 of the Luxembourg Code of Commerce (Code de commerce), specified transactions (including the granting of a security interest for antecedent debts save in respect of financial collateral arrangements within the meaning of the Financial Collateral Law; the payment of debts which have not fallen due, whether payment is made in cash or by way of assignment, sale, set-off or by any other means; the payment of debts which have fallen due by any means other than in cash or by bill of exchange; and the sale of assets without consideration or with substantially inadequate consideration) entered into during the preference period (or the 10 days preceding it) must be set aside or declared null and void, if so requested by the insolvency receiver; - pursuant to article 446 of the Luxembourg Code of Commerce, payments made for matured debts as well as other transactions concluded for consideration during the preference period are subject to cancellation by the court upon proceedings instituted by the insolvency receiver if they were concluded with the knowledge of the bankrupt party’s cessation of payments; and - pursuant to article 448 of the Luxembourg Code of Commerce and article 1167 of the Civil Code (action paulienne), the insolvency receiver (acting on behalf of the creditors) has the right to challenge any fraudulent payments and transactions, including the granting of security with an intent to defraud, made prior to the bankruptcy, without any time limit. In principle, a bankruptcy order rendered by a Luxembourg court does not result in the automatic termination of contracts except for employment agreements and powers of attorney. The contracts, therefore, subsist after the bankruptcy order. However, the bankruptcy receiver may choose to terminate certain contracts so as to avoid worsening the financial situation of the company. As of the date of adjudication of bankruptcy, no interest on any unsecured claim will accrue vis-`a-vis the bankruptcy estate. Insolvency proceedings may hence have a material adverse effect on the relevant Luxembourg company’s business and assets and the Luxembourg company’s respective obligations under the Notes. Finally, international aspects of Luxembourg bankruptcy, controlled management or composition proceedings may be subject to the EUIR. In particular, rights in rem over assets located in another jurisdiction where the EUIR is applicable, will not be affected by the opening of insolvency proceedings, without prejudice, however, to the applicability of rules relating to the voidness, voidability or unenforceability of legal acts detrimental to all the creditors (subject to the application of article 24 of the Financial Collateral Law as described above and article 13 of the EUIR). Under Luxembourg law, the following types of proceedings (together referred to as ‘‘insolvency proceedings’’) may be opened against an entity having its registered office or ‘‘centre of main interests’’ in Luxembourg: - bankruptcy proceedings (faillite), the opening of which may be requested by the company or by any of its creditors. Following such a request, the court having jurisdiction may open bankruptcy proceedings if the company (i) is in a state of cessation of payments (cessation des paiements) and cumulatively (ii) has lost its commercial creditworthiness. If a court finds that 188 ----- these conditions are satisfied, it may also open bankruptcy proceedings ex officio (absent a request made by the company or a creditor). The main effect of such proceedings is the suspension of all measures of enforcement against the company, except, subject to certain limited exceptions, only for secured creditors and the payment of the creditors in accordance with their rank upon realization of the assets; - controlled management proceedings (gestion contrˆol´ee), the opening of which may only be requested by the company and not by its creditors; - composition proceedings (concordat pr´eventif de faillite), which may be requested only by the company and not by its creditors. The court’s decision to admit a company to composition proceedings triggers a provisional stay on enforcement of claims by creditors; - stay on payments (sursis de paiements) or to put the Issuer into judicial liquidation (liquidation _judiciaire). Judicial liquidation proceedings may be opened at the request of the public_ prosecutor against companies pursuing an activity violating criminal laws or that are in serious breach or violation of the Luxembourg Commercial Code or of the Luxembourg laws applicable to commercial companies. The management of such liquidation proceedings will generally follow the rules of bankruptcy proceedings. The Issuer’s liabilities in respect of the Notes will, in the event of a liquidation of the Issuer following bankruptcy or judicial liquidation proceedings, only rank after the cost of liquidation (including any debt incurred for the purpose of such liquidation) and those of the Issuer’s debts that are entitled to priority under Luxembourg law. Preferential debts under Luxembourg law include, among others: - remuneration owed to employees (last six months’ wages amounting to a maximum of six times the minimum social salary); - employees’ contributions to social security; - amounts owed to the Luxembourg Revenue (including direct and indirect taxes); - the employer’s contribution to social security; - landlord, pledgor not under the Financial Collateral Law (as defined herein); and - unsecured creditors. Assets over which a security interest has been granted will in principle not be available for distribution to unsecured creditors (except after enforcement and to the extent a surplus is realized). During such insolvency proceedings, all enforcement measures by unsecured creditors are suspended. The ability of secured creditors to enforce their security interests may also be limited (particularly in the event of controlled management proceedings providing expressly that the rights of secured creditors will be frozen until a final decision has been taken by the court as to the petition for controlled management) and may be affected thereafter by any reorganization order given by the court. Furthermore, declarations of default and subsequent acceleration (such as acceleration upon the occurrence of an event of default) are not enforceable during controlled management proceedings. Luxembourg insolvency laws may affect transactions entered into or payments made by the Issuer during the period before any liquidation or administration. If the liquidator or administrator can demonstrate that a payment was made during the ‘‘preference period’’ (which is a maximum of six months and 10 days preceding the judgment declaring bankruptcy) that is disadvantageous to the estate of creditors and the party receiving such payment is shown to have known that the bankrupt party had generally stopped making payments when such payment occurred, a Luxembourg court has the power, among other things, to void the preferential transaction. If the liquidator or administrator can demonstrate that the Issuer has given ‘‘preference’’ to any person by defrauding the rights of creditors generally, regardless of when this fraud occurred, a Luxembourg court has the power, among other things, to void the preferential transaction. Finally, any international aspects of Luxembourg bankruptcy, controlled management and composition proceedings may be subject to the EU Insolvency Law.

Luxembourg law dated August 10, 1915 on commercial companies, as amended, does not provide for rules governing the ability of a Luxembourg company to guarantee the indebtedness of another entity of the same group. It is generally held that within a group of companies, the corporate interest of each individual corporate entity should, to a certain extent, be tempered by and subordinated to the interest of the group. A reciprocal assistance from one group company to another does not necessarily conflict with the interest of the assisting company. However, this assistance must be justified by a group policy, be in proportion with the real financial means of the assisting company (which in relation to upstream or cross-stream guarantees may be addressed by guarantee limitations) and have a reciprocal character. A guarantee not satisfying these criteria would expose its de facto or de jure directors or managers to personal liability or criminal liability. In addition, the guarantee or security interest could itself be held unenforceable. The Guarantee granted by Sub Lecta S.A. will be limited to a certain percentage of, among other things, the company’s net worth (capitaux propres). The granting of the Guarantee or of the security interests also needs to be part of the corporate object of Sub Lecta S.A. _Security Interests_ Assets over which a valid security right has been granted will in principle not be available for distribution to unsecured creditors (except after enforcement and to the extent a surplus is realized). Under Article 20 of the Luxembourg Act dated August 5, 2005 on financial collateral arrangements, as amended (the ‘‘Collateral Act’’), all collateral arrangements in respect of assets over which Luxembourg security rights have been granted, as well as all enforcement measures and valuation and enforcement measures agreed upon by the parties in accordance with the Collateral Act, are valid and enforceable against third parties, insolvency receivers, liquidators and other similar persons notwithstanding the insolvency proceedings and even if entered into during the pre-bankruptcy period (p´eriode suspecte) (in all cases except in case of fraud). Security rights granted by Sub Lecta S.A. that are governed by a law other than Luxembourg law are subject to Article 24 of the Collateral Act, which provides that a foreign law security right granted by a Luxembourg grantor will be valid and enforceable as a matter of Luxembourg law notwithstanding any Luxembourg insolvency proceedings, if such foreign law security right is similar in nature to a Luxembourg financial collateral arrangement falling within the scope of the Collateral Act (i.e., a pledge or transfer of title by way of security covering financial instruments and/or monetary claims). Notwithstanding the foregoing, a foreign security that is not of a similar legal nature to a Luxembourg security right, where it covers collateral located in a Member State (other than Luxembourg) of the European Union party to the EU Insolvency Regulation will not be affected by Luxembourg insolvency proceedings.",N/A,as_expected,2016,557
172_2,Offerings 2016.md,1131,LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE GUARANTEES AND THE SECURITY INTERESTS,1131.5,Spain,1131.5.1,Insolvency,"Under the current Spanish Insolvency Law, a debtor is considered insolvent when it cannot possibly comply with its due obligations on a regular basis (the so-called ‘‘current insolvency’’ (insolvencia actual) or when it expects that it will shortly be unable to do so (the so-called ‘‘imminent insolvency’’ (insolvencia inminente). The debtor must seek the court’s assistance in order to be declared bankrupt within two months as of the date the debtor knew or should have been aware of its insolvency. A creditor may also apply for a debtor’s insolvency if it can prove to the court: (i) a general failure on the part of the debtor to meet its payment obligations; (ii) the existence of attachments on the debtor’s assets that will generally affect its business; (iii) a general liquidation by the debtor of its assets in certain circumstances; or (iv) a general failure on the part of the debtor to comply with tax, social security, salary and other employment obligations during the three-month period preceding the insolvency filing. If filed by the debtor, the insolvency is deemed ‘‘voluntary’’ (concurso voluntario) and, if filed by a third party, the insolvency is deemed ‘‘mandatory’’ (concurso necesario). In the case of voluntary insolvency, as a general rule, the debtor retains the management and full powers of disposal over its assets, although it is subject to the intervention (intervenci´on) of the insolvency administrators. 190 ----- In the case of mandatory insolvency, as a general rule, the debtor’s management powers are suspended, and management’s former power, including the power to dispose of assets, is conferred solely upon the insolvency administrators. There is no clawback date by operation of law. Therefore, there are no prior transactions that automatically become void as a result of the initiation of insolvency proceedings but instead the insolvency administrators must expressly challenge those transactions. Under the current Spanish Insolvency Law, upon a declaration of insolvency, acts detrimental (perjudiciales) to the debtor’s estate carried out during the two years prior to the date the insolvency is declared may be rescinded, regardless of fraudulent intention. Article 71 contains an irrefutable presumption that those acts where no consideration is received for a disposed asset and acts which result in the early repayment of obligations which would have become due after the declaration of insolvency (unless such obligations were guaranteed by means of an in rem security) are detrimental. In addition, unless the debtor or another affected party (such as a creditor) can prove otherwise to the court’s satisfaction, a disposal made in favor of a related person or entity (as defined in the Spanish Insolvency Law) as well as the creation of a security interest securing a preexisting obligation or a new obligation that replaces an existing one, and those payments or other acts extinguishing obligations which would have become due after the declaration of insolvency and which are guaranteed by means of an in rem security, are presumed to be detrimental. In the case of actions not covered by the presumptions above, the burden of proof is on the person bringing the action of rescission. Acts deriving from the debtor’s ordinary course of business made at arm’s length and some kinds of refinancing arrangements meeting certain legal requirements set forth in Article 71 bis may not be rescinded (as explained below). Accordingly, a Guarantor’s acts of disposal with a ‘‘related person or entity,’’ as defined in the Spanish Insolvency Law (such as the Issuer), are presumed to be detrimental unless proved otherwise. Also, the general principle of ‘‘no termination effect’’ is established such that all agreements remain effective at the time of the insolvency. Creditors may join more than one set of insolvency proceedings together, or apply for a joint insolvency order for various entities if the debtor belongs to a group of companies with joint decisionmaking powers and joint assets. In any event, and particularly in joint insolvency proceedings, set-off is prohibited unless the requirements for the set-off were satisfied prior to the declaration of insolvency or the set-off provisions are pursuant to an agreement subject to a law that permits set-off. The current Spanish Insolvency Law also makes a distinction between general debts (cr´editos _concursales) under insolvency proceedings and debts against the insolvency estate (cr´editos contra la masa). Debts against the insolvency estate, such as certain amounts of the employee payroll and the_ costs and expenses of the insolvency proceedings, and 50% of the funds lent under a refinancing arrangement entered into in compliance with the requirements set forth in Article 71 bis, are not considered part of the debtor’s general debt and are paid before other debts under insolvency proceedings and at their respective maturities (as this will be further explained). The Spanish Insolvency Law provides that insolvency proceedings conclude following either the implementation of an agreement between the creditors and the debtor (the ‘‘Company Voluntary Agreement’’ or the ‘‘CVA’’) or the liquidation of the debtor. Creditors are required to report their claims to the insolvency administrators within one month from the last official publication of the court order declaring the insolvency, providing a copy of the documentation that justifies such claims though the insolvency administrator can ask for the original one. Based on the documentation provided by the creditors and documentation held by the debtor, the insolvency administrator draws up a list of acknowledged creditors/claims and classifies them according to the categories established in the Spanish Insolvency Law: - Creditors benefiting from special privileges, representing security on certain assets (in rem sureties). Nevertheless the amount of the special privileged credit will reach the value of the guarantee calculated according to the formula fixed by law. These privileges may entail separate proceedings, although subject to certain restrictions derived from a waiting period that may last up to one year. Secured creditors are bound by the CVA if they have voted in favor of it, and though they might not have voted in favor, they will also be enforced by the CVA if certain creditor majorities are met (labor, public, financial or the others). In the event of liquidation, they are the first to collect payment against the assets on which they are 191 ----- secured. However, the insolvency administrator has the option to halt any enforcement of the securities and pay these claims as administrative expenses under specific payment rules. - Creditors benefiting from a general privilege, including, among other things, specific labor claims and specific claims brought by public entities or authorities, which are recognized for half their amount, and claims held by the creditor taking the initiative to apply for the insolvency proceedings, for up to 50% of the amount of such debt and the funds lent under a refinancing arrangement entered into in compliance with the requirements set forth in Article 71 bis (in the amount not admitted as a debt against the insolvency estate). Secured creditor are bound by the CVA if they have voted in favor of it, and though they might not have voted in favor, they will also be enforced by the CVA if certain creditors majorities are met (labor, public, financial or the others) and, in the event of liquidation, they are the first collecting payment, in accordance with the ranking established under the Spanish Insolvency Law. - Ordinary creditors (non-subordinated and non-privileged claims), such as ordinary commercial suppliers, will be paid once the privileged credits have been paid and pro rata temporis. This is a residual category. - Subordinated creditors (so classified by virtue of an agreement or pursuant to law), include, among others, credits communicated late (outside the specific one-month period mentioned above); credits which are contractually subordinated vis-`a-vis all other credits of the debtor; credits relating to surcharge and unpaid interest claims (including default interest) except for those credits secured with an in rem right up to the secured amount; fines; and loans or similar transactions granted by those creditors which are ‘‘specially related parties’’ to the insolvent debtor. Other claims are not subject to the insolvency proceedings and are therefore neither acknowledged nor classified. These include any claims accrued after the insolvency proceedings (e.g., those entered into in order to continue the business) as well as other claims prescribed by law, even if accrued earlier (i.e., salaries accrued during the last 30 days before the insolvency proceedings are initiated or new money lent within the context of protected refinancing agreements: 50% if lent after October 2016, 100% if lent before 2016). These claims are immediately payable (cr´editos contra la masa), although the Spanish Insolvency Law imposes some restrictions on their enforceability. In the case of a legal entity, the following shall be deemed to be ‘‘specially related parties’’: (i) shareholders with unlimited liability; (ii) limited liability shareholders holding 10% or more of the insolvent company’s share capital (or 5% if the company is listed); (iii) directors and those holding general powers of attorney from the insolvent company and those who have held the said posts in the two years immediately preceding the declaration of insolvency; and (iv) companies pertaining to the same group as the debtor and their common shareholders, provided such shareholders meet the minimum shareholding requirements set forth in (ii) above. Subordinated creditors do not have the right to vote at the creditors’ meeting (whereby the CVA is approved or rejected) and they are not paid until ordinary credits are not fully satisfied. As a general rule, insolvency proceedings are not compatible with other enforcement proceedings. When compatible, in order to protect the interests of the debtor and creditors, the Spanish Insolvency Law extends the jurisdiction of the court dealing with insolvency proceedings, which is then legally authorized to handle any enforcement proceedings or interim measures affecting the debtor’s assets (whether based upon civil, labor or administrative law).",N/A,as_expected,2016,557
172_2,Offerings 2016.md,1131,LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE GUARANTEES AND THE SECURITY INTERESTS,1131.5,Spain,1131.5.2,Pre-insolvency moratorium (section 5 bis of the Spanish Insolvency Law),"The debtor is allowed to obtain an additional four-month moratorium upon application to the court, in order to allow the discussion of an advanced proposal for arrangement or a refinancing agreement. The debtor would have to file the application for the declaration of insolvency within the four-month period if it has not reached a restructuring agreement that resolves its insolvency issues. Court and out-of-court enforcement actions against assets which are necessary to enable the business to continue cannot be pursued by creditors from the time an application for a moratorium is filed with the court. Insolvency filing by creditors would also not be allowed. Creditors involved in a scheme of arrangement would also not be allowed to enforce (against any assets) if at least 51% of the 192 ----- financial creditors have agreed not to do so while the scheme was being negotiated. Apart from that, business would continue as usual after the filing of the application under section 5 bis the Spanish Insolvency Law. The debtor will not be entitled to apply for any further moratorium within a year of the last moratorium being granted. The amendments to the Spanish Insolvency Law introduced in 2009, 2011 and 2014 by the Spanish legislator aimed to reduce the risk of claw-back under certain circumstances, thus facilitating certain refinancing agreements between financial entities and companies in distress. The refinancing agreement will avoid the risk of being subject to a claw-back action if certain conditions are met (Article 71 bis of the Spanish Insolvency Law): - The refinancing agreement is deemed to be a transaction providing for: - a ‘‘significant’’ increase of the available funds, or - a novation or write-off of the existing obligations (as a result either of the extension of the term, or the establishment of obligations to replace the existing ones). - Requirements to be met by such refinancing agreements in order to be outside of the claw-back regime are the following: - Formalities: the agreement must be executed in a public instrument enclosing all of the documents that justify the fulfilment of the requirements set out below. - Creditors’ approval: the agreement must be signed by creditors representing at least three fifths of the debtor’s liabilities (including non-financial liabilities, e.g., trade creditors) at the date of the adoption of the refinancing agreement. In cases where refinancing agreements affect a group of companies, this majority needs to be achieved at an individual company level and at a consolidated group level, (intercompany debts are excluded for voting purposes). For the purpose of calculating these majorities, in case of syndicated loans, the approval by 75% of the syndicated creditors (or less if agreed in the syndicated facilities) will be binding for 100% of the syndicated debt. - Viability: the agreement must be supported by a viability plan that confirms the debtor’s ability to continue the business in the short and medium term. - Certificate of auditors: the agreement must include a certificate issued by the auditors of the debtor confirming that the required majority has been duly calculated. Agreements that do not meet the requirements mentioned above will also be protected if the following conditions are all met: (i) they entail the reduction of the proportion between liabilities and assets; i.e. write-off; (ii) the resulting current assets exceed the resulting short term liabilities; (iii) the resulting securities do not guarantee more than 90% of the resulting liabilities, nor do they entail an increase of the percentage of liabilities secured prior to the agreement; (iv) the resulting interest rate does not exceed in more than 1/3 the former interest rate; and (v) the agreement is executed in a public instrument and includes a detailed explanation of the transaction. _Extended binding effects of the protected refinancing agreements_ If judicially sanctioned, certain refinancing agreements will be, not only protected from future claw-back actions (51% majority of financial liabilities would be enough for this purpose), but also will cram down financial creditors who have dissented. Dissenting unsecured financial creditors, or secured financial creditors with exposures that exceed the value of their security, will be bound by judicially sanctioned agreements as follows: - If the agreement has been approved by 60% of the financial liabilities of the debtor, the aforementioned creditors will be bound by any debt extensions for up to 5 years and by any agreed conversion of debt into Profit Participating Loans (‘‘PPLs’’) with a term of less than 5 years. - If the agreement has been approved by 75% of the financial liabilities of the debtor, the aforementioned creditors will be bound by any debt extensions agreed for up to 10 years, 193 ----- write-offs and any agreed conversion of debt into PPL up to 10 years, debt to equity swaps and payments in kind of the loans. Dissenting secured financial creditors will be bound by judicially sanctioned refinancing agreements for the amounts covered by the security as follows: - If the agreement has been approved by 65% of the financial liabilities of the debtor, the aforementioned creditors will be bound by an extension of the debt for up to 5 years and by any agreed conversion of debt into PPL also with a term not exceeding 5 years. - If the agreement has been approved by 80% of the financial liabilities of the debtor, the aforementioned creditors will be bound by an extension of the debt up to 10 years, write-offs and any agreed conversion of debt into PPL for up to 10 years, debt to equity swaps and payments in kind of the loans. For this purpose, the security value will be 90% of the reasonable value of the asset (as defined in the Spanish Insolvency Law) after deducting other liabilities that are preferentially secured by the same asset. For the calculation of the aforementioned majorities the following should be taken into account: - Financial liabilities will include any financial claims excluding public, commercial claims and connected party claims. - In case of syndicated loans, the approval by 75% of the syndicated creditors (or less if agreed so in the syndicating facilities) will entail the approving vote of 100% of the debt. The protected refinancing agreements are subject to the approval of an insolvency judge. By means of an expedited proceeding, the judge will verify that the above requirements have been met. Once approved, any affected creditors may file a challenge by way of incidental proceedings, only if they find that the majorities have not been properly calculated or if the refinancing agreement represents a disproportionate sacrifice for the affected creditors. _New money lending_ Amendments of 2014 have introduced two preferences for new money, in order to facilitate the obtaining of financing by companies with financial difficulties: - Financing granted in the context of refinancing in accordance with Article 71 bis of the Spanish Insolvency Law will be split into a claim against the insolvency estate and a claim enjoying a general priority, in the event of subsequent insolvency proceedings. - Financing in the context of an agreement will be made against the insolvency estate if liquidation arises later (unless it was granted by a connected party). The amendment of 2014 has enhanced this regime, by providing that until October 2, 2016 financing granted in the context of refinancing in accordance with 71 bis of the Spanish Insolvency Law will be considered a claim against the insolvency estate, even if it was granted by a connected party. _Applicable Jurisdiction_ The applicable jurisdiction to conduct an insolvency proceeding is the one in which the insolvent party has its ‘‘centre of main interests.’’ This center is deemed to be where the insolvent party conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and which is recognized as such by third parties. Insolvency proceedings conducted by the court with jurisdiction over the ‘‘centre of main interests’’ are considered to be the ‘‘principal insolvency proceedings’’ and have universal reach affecting all the assets of the insolvent party worldwide. If the ‘‘centre of main interests’’ is not in Spain, but the insolvent party has a permanent establishment in Spain, Spanish courts will only have jurisdiction over the assets located in Spain (the ‘‘territorial insolvency proceedings’’). In the event Spanish courts have jurisdiction (upon a judicial consideration that the Issuer’s ‘‘centre of main interests’’ is in Spain), Article 87.6 of the current Spanish Insolvency Law would apply to the Issuer. Article 87.6 provides that creditors holding a third-party guarantee will be recognized in the insolvency proceeding in their full amount without any limitation and without prejudice to the subrogation of the guarantor in the creditor’s place, if the guarantee is enforced. This Article also 194 ----- provides that both bondholders’ and guarantors’ credits will be classified according to what is more beneficial for the insolvent debtor. The Guarantors’ credits against the Issuer would be subordinated because they are related entities, as discussed above. Although there are no clear judicial precedents in respect of this matter, under Article 87.6 a bondholder’s credits might be classified as subordinated, notwithstanding their original qualification as ordinary credits, because the classification as subordinated (instead of ordinary credits) would be more beneficial to the insolvent party. In the event that any of the Guarantors becomes insolvent and is subject to the current Spanish Insolvency Law, its Guarantee will be treated as ordinary debt. Under the current Spanish Insolvency Law, the funding loans between the Spanish Guarantors and the Issuer would be treated as subordinated debt. In addition, creditors may seek repayment directly from the insolvent entity’s directors or attorneys in fact if a court determines that the bankruptcy resulted from their negligence (concurso culpable), if some legal requirements are met. _Moratorium_ The current Spanish Insolvency Law imposes a moratorium on the enforcement of secured creditor’s rights in the event of insolvency. The moratorium would take effect following the declaration of insolvency until the earlier of (i) one year from the declaration of the insolvency if the insolvent company has not been placed in liquidation or (ii) the date the creditors reach an agreement that does not affect the exercise of the rights granted by the security interest. However, such moratorium may only be imposed where the assets subject to the guarantee are necessary for the debtor’s activity.",N/A,as_expected,2016,557

The terms ‘‘enforceable,’’ ‘‘enforceability,’’ ‘‘valid,’’ ‘‘legal,’’ ‘‘binding’’ and ‘‘effective’’ (or any combination thereof) mean that all the obligations assumed by the relevant party under the relevant documents are of a type enforced by Spanish courts; the terms do not mean that these obligations will necessarily be enforced in all circumstances in accordance with their terms. In particular, enforcement before the courts will in any event be subject to: - the nature of the remedies available in the courts; and - the availability of defenses such as (without limitation), set-off (unless validly waived), fraud (fraude de ley), abuse in the exercise of rights (abuso de derecho), misrepresentation, force majeure, unforeseen circumstances, undue influence, duress, abatement and counterclaim. In general terms, under Spanish law, any guarantee, pledge or mortgage must guarantee or secure another obligation to which it is ancillary, which must be clearly identified in the relevant guarantee or security agreement. Therefore, the guarantee or security interest follows the underlying obligation in such a way that nullity of the underlying obligation entails nullity of the guarantee or security and termination of the underlying obligation entails termination of the guarantee or security. In the event that the security providers are able to prove that there are no existing and valid guaranteed obligations, Spanish courts may consider that the security providers’ obligations under the relevant guarantees or securities are not enforceable. The obligations under the Guarantee granted by a Spanish Guarantor: - shall not extend to any use of the proceeds of the Notes for the purpose of acquiring shares representing the share capital of such Spanish Guarantor or shares representing the share capital of its holding company, or refinancing a previous debt incurred for the acquisition of shares representing the share capital of such Spanish Guarantor or shares representing the share capital of its holding company; and - shall be deemed not to be undertaken or incurred by the Spanish Guarantor to the extent that the same would constitute unlawful financial assistance within the meaning of Article 150 of the Spanish Companies Act (Real Decreto Legislativo 1/2010, de 2 de Julio, approving Texto Refundido de la Ley de Sociedades de Capital), and, in that case, all provisions of such Guarantee shall be construed accordingly in the sense that, in no case can any Guarantee or security given by the Spanish Guarantor secure repayment of the above mentioned funds. 195 ----- Under Spanish law, the ability of the Security Trustee to enforce the collateral consisting of pledges governed by Spanish law may be restricted. In this regard, you should be aware of the following: - Spanish law does not expressly forbid the possibility of creating more than a single pledge over the same assets or rights. Nevertheless, some scholars and practitioners believe that Spanish law may indirectly forbid the creation of multiple pledges over the same assets or rights. To the best of our knowledge, there is no Spanish Supreme Court case law that directly resolves this issue. - Catalan law expressly forbids granting more than one pledge over the same assets or rights (unless the pledges are given for the benefit of the same creditors). However, some scholars and practitioners believe that since Catalan law does not expressly provide for the creation of a pledge securing different obligations, it would be possible to create one single pledge securing different obligations without any restriction. To the best of our knowledge, there is no Spanish Supreme Court case law that directly resolves this issue. - Under Spanish law, pledges are governed by the law where the pledged assets are located (lex _rei sitae). Collateral consisting of concurrent pledges over the same assets will be governed by_ Spanish state law (which, as described above, does not expressly forbid granting more than one pledge over the same asset), as these assets will be located in a place where only Spanish state law is applicable. - Spanish law does not recognize the concept of security trustees and, therefore, trust structures may not be recognized by Spanish courts. In this case, there is a risk that a Spanish court would consider a pledge given for the benefit of a security trustee as a number of concurrent, independent pledges, each of them securing the rights of each of the individual beneficiaries of the trust. In this case, if these pledges are governed by Catalan law, there is the possibility that only one of the pledges will be valid, and the remaining pledges will be deemed null and void. However, as mentioned above, some scholars and practitioners believe that since Catalan law does not expressly provide for the creation of a pledge securing different obligations, it would be possible to create one single pledge securing different obligations without any restriction. To the best of our knowledge, there is no Spanish Supreme Court case law that directly resolves this issue. As a result, the Security Trustee may not be able to enforce the pledges on behalf of all of the secured creditors, and secured creditors treated under Spanish law as not having the benefit of the pledges effectively may be treated as unsecured creditors. 196 -----",N/A,as_expected,2016,557

By the Interest Withholding Tax Law, effective as of January 1, 2006, Luxembourg introduced a withholding tax of 10% on savings income in the form of interest paid or secured by a Luxembourg paying agent to or for the benefit of beneficial owners, who are individuals, resident in Luxembourg and residual entities (i.e. entities (i) that are not legal persons (whereby certain Swedish and Finnish entities which have legal personality are nevertheless treated as not being a separate legal person for this provision), (ii) whose profits are not taxed under the general arrangements for business taxation; and (iii) which are not (or have not opted to be considered as) a UCITS recognized in accordance with the Council Directive 85/611/EEC, as replaced by the Directive 2009/65/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council, the ‘‘Residual Entities’’) established in other EU Member States or certain dependent and associated territories thereof (to the extent beneficial owners who are individuals resident in Luxembourg have an interest in such entities and, according to the Interest Withholding Tax Law, if the Residual Entity has not opted for information exchange or to be treated as a UCITS). For an individual holder of Notes who is a resident of Luxembourg and who acts in the course of the management of his private wealth, the 10% withholding tax is a final levy (the ‘‘10% WHT’’). Furthermore, a Luxembourg resident individual who acts in the course of the management of his/her private wealth and who is the beneficial owner of an interest payment made by a paying agent established outside Luxembourg in an EU Member State or in a member of the European Economic Area or in a jurisdiction having concluded an agreement with Luxembourg in connection with the European Council Directive 2003/48/EC of June 3, 2003 on the taxation of savings income in the form of interest payments, as amended and repealed, may also, in accordance with the Withholding Tax Law, opt for a final 10% levy (the ‘‘10% Levy’’). In such case, the 10% Levy is calculated on the same amounts as for the payments made by Luxembourg resident paying agents. The option for the 10% Levy must cover all interest payments made by the paying agent to the Luxembourg resident beneficial owner during the entire civil year. A holder of Notes is subject to Luxembourg income tax in respect of the interest paid or accrued on the Notes only if such holder (i) is or is deemed to be a resident of Luxembourg for tax purposes and the interest falls within the scope of the 10% Levy but the holder has not opted for the application of the 10% Levy or (ii) is or is deemed to be a resident of Luxembourg for tax purposes and the interest has not been received by him in the course of the management of his private wealth or 201 ----- (iii) such income is attributable to an enterprise or part thereof, which is carried on through a fixed place of business, a permanent establishment or a permanent representative in Luxembourg. Responsibility for the withholding of tax in application of the Interest Withholding Tax Law is assumed by the Luxembourg paying agent (within the meaning of the Interest Withholding Tax Law), which is not necessarily the issuer of Notes. _Taxation of Capital Gains_ Gains realized by an individual holder of Notes, who acts in the course of the management of his/her private wealth and who is resident in Luxembourg for tax purposes, are not subject to Luxembourg income tax, unless they (i) correspond to redemption premiums or issue discounts or (ii) are speculative gains within the meaning of Luxembourg income tax law.

The regulations may impose obligations on the Issuer and holders of Notes, if the Issuer is considered as a Reporting Financial Institution (e.g. an Investment Entity) under the CRS, so that the latter could be required to conduct due diligence and obtain (among other things) confirmation of the tax residency, tax identification number and CRS classification of holders of Notes in order to fulfil its own legal obligations from 1 January 2016. Further, the holders of Notes have permitted the Issuer to share such information with the relevant taxing authority.

Under the IGA, Luxembourg-resident financial institutions that comply with the requirements of the Luxembourg IGA Legislation are treated as compliant with FATCA and, as a result, are not subject to withholding tax under FATCA (‘‘FATCA Withholding’’).

A cash method U.S. holder will be required to include in gross income the U.S. dollar value of the interest payment, based on the spot exchange rate on the date of receipt, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars at that time. A cash method U.S. holder will not realize foreign currency exchange gain or loss on the receipt of the interest income but may recognize exchange gain or loss upon the actual disposition of the euro so received. An accrual method U.S. holder may determine the amount of income recognized with respect to such interest in accordance with either of two methods. Under the first method, an accrual method U.S. holder will be required to include in gross income the interest income that has accrued on the Notes during an interest accrual period in euro and translate that amount into U.S. dollars at the average rate of exchange in effect for the interest accrual period (or, with respect to an accrual period that spans two taxable years, at the average rate for the partial period within the U.S. holder’s taxable year). The average rate of exchange for an interest accrual period (or partial period) is the simple average of the spot exchange rates for each business day of the period or other average rate for the period that is reasonably derived and consistently applied by the holder. Under the second method, an accrual method U.S. holder may make an election to translate interest income at the spot rate on (i) the last day of the interest accrual period, (ii) the last day of the taxable year in the case of a partial accrual period, or (iii) the date of receipt or payment if such date is within five business days of the last day of the accrual period. This election must be applied consistently to all debt instruments from year to year and cannot be changed without the consent of the Internal Revenue Service (the ‘‘IRS’’). An accrual method U.S. holder generally will realize exchange gain or loss with respect to accrued interest income on the date the interest payment actually is received. The amount of exchange gain or loss to be recognized by the holder will be an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of the euro interest payment received (determined on the basis of the spot rate on the date the interest income is received) in respect of the accrual period and the U.S. dollar value of the interest income that has accrued during the accrual period (as determined above), regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars at that time.

The amount realized generally will equal the amount of any cash plus the fair market value of any property received in exchange for the Notes, translated into U.S. dollars at the spot rate on the date of disposition. A U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Notes generally will be the cost of such Note to the U.S. holder. The cost of a Note purchased with euro will be the U.S. dollar value of the euro purchase price on the date of purchase, calculated at the spot rate in effect on that date. If the Notes are traded on an established securities market, a cash method taxpayer and an electing accrual method taxpayer will determine the U.S. dollar value of the amount realized by 205 ----- translating that amount at the spot rate on the settlement date of the sale or other taxable disposition, and will determine the U.S. dollar value of the cost of the Notes at the spot rate on the settlement date of the purchase.

Except as discussed in the following paragraph with respect to foreign currency exchange gains or losses, any gain or loss recognized upon the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of the Notes by a U.S. holder generally will be U.S.-source capital gain or loss, and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the Notes have been held for more than one year at the time of the sale or other disposition. Long-term capital gains recognized by a non-corporate U.S. holder (including an individual) generally are subject to U.S. federal income taxation at preferential rates. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to significant limitations. Gain or loss realized upon the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of the Notes that is attributable to fluctuations in currency exchange rates will constitute exchange gain or loss with respect to the principal amount to the extent provided under special rules. This exchange gain or loss generally will be taxable as U.S.-source ordinary income or loss, but generally will not be treated as interest income or expense. For these purposes, the principal amount of a Note is a U.S. holder’s purchase price for the Note calculated in euro on the date of purchase. A U.S. holder will recognize exchange gain or loss on the principal amount of the Notes equal to the difference between (i) the U.S. dollar value of the euro principal amount of the Notes determined at the spot rate on the date of the sale or other taxable disposition and (ii) the U.S. dollar value of the euro principal amount of the Notes determined at the spot rate on the date the U.S. holder acquired the Notes (or, in each case, determined on the settlement date, if the Notes are traded on an established securities market and the holder is either a cash basis U.S. holder or an electing accrual basis U.S. holder). In addition, upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. holder may recognize exchange gain or loss attributable to amounts received with respect to accrued and unpaid stated interest, if any, which will be treated as discussed above under ‘‘—Payments of Stated Interest’’.

Investments by ERISA Plans are subject to ERISA’s general fiduciary requirements, including, but not limited to, the requirement of investment prudence and diversification and the requirement that an ERISA Plan’s investments be made in accordance with the documents governing the plan. Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit certain transactions involving the assets of an ERISA Plan (as well as those plans that are not subject to ERISA but which are subject to Section 4975 of the Code, such as individual retirement accounts (together with ERISA Plans, ‘‘Plans’’)) and certain persons (referred to as ‘‘parties in interest’’ or ‘‘disqualified persons’’) having certain relationships to such Plans, unless a statutory or administrative exemption is applicable to the transaction. A party in interest or disqualified person who engages in a prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. Any Plan fiduciary which proposes to cause a Plan to purchase the Notes should consult with its counsel regarding the applicability of the fiduciary responsibility and prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code to such an investment, and to confirm that such purchase and holding will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction or any other violation of an applicable requirement of ERISA. Non-U.S. plans, governmental plans and certain church plans, while not subject to the fiduciary responsibility provisions of ERISA or the prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code, may nevertheless be subject to non-U.S., state, local or other federal laws or regulations that are substantially similar to the foregoing provisions of ERISA and the Code (‘‘Similar Law’’).

Furthermore, a substantial portion of the assets of the Issuer and Sub Lecta S.A. and a substantial portion of the assets of such persons are located outside the United States. As a result, it may not be possible for investors to effect service of process within the United States upon those persons, the Issuer or Sub Lecta S.A., or to enforce against them judgments of U.S. courts predicated upon the civil liability provisions of U.S. federal or state securities laws. We have been advised by our Luxembourg counsel that the United States and Luxembourg are not currently bound by a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitral awards rendered in civil and commercial matters. According to such counsel, an enforceable judgment for the payment of monies rendered by any U.S. Federal or state court based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon the U.S. securities laws, would not directly be enforceable in Luxembourg. However, a party who received such favorable judgment in a U.S. court may initiate enforcement proceedings in Luxembourg (exequatur) by requesting enforcement of the U.S. judgment by the District Court (Tribunal d’Arrondissement) pursuant to Section 678 of the New Luxembourg Code of Civil Procedure. The District Court will authorize the enforcement in Luxembourg of the U.S. judgment if it is satisfied that all of the following conditions are met: - the U.S. judgment is enforceable (ex´ecutoire) in the United States; - the U.S. court awarding the judgment had jurisdiction to adjudicate the respective matter according to Luxembourg private international law rules and, in particular, that Luxembourg courts had not exclusive jurisdiction over the respective matter; - the U.S. judgment does not contravene international public policy as understood under the laws of Luxembourg; - the U.S. court has acted in accordance with its own procedural laws and has applied to the dispute the substantive law which would have been applied by Luxembourg courts; - the principles of fair trial and due process have been complied with and in particular, the U.S. judgment was granted following proceedings where the counterparty had the opportunity to appear, and if it appeared, to present a defense; - the U.S. judgment has not been obtained fraudulently; and - the U.S. judgment is not irreconciliable with another judgment enforceable in Luxembourg in relation to the same dispute or a similar dispute. Subject to the above conditions, Luxembourg courts tend not to review the merits of a foreign judgment, although there is no statutory prohibition. We have also been advised by our Luxembourg counsel that if an original action is brought in Luxembourg, Luxembourg courts may refuse to apply the designated law (i) if the choice of such law was not made bona fide and (ii) if its application contravenes Luxembourg public policy or is manifestly incompatible with Luxembourg international policy rules. In an action brought in Luxembourg on the basis of U.S. federal or state securities laws, Luxembourg courts may not have the requisite power to grant the remedies sought. Also, an exequatur may be refused in respect of punitive damages. Furthermore, in the event of any proceedings being brought in a Luxembourg court in respect of a monetary obligation expressed to be payable in a currency other than euro, a Luxembourg court would have power to give judgment expressed as an order to pay a currency other than euro. However, enforcement of the judgment against any party in Luxembourg would be available only in euro and for such purposes all claims or debts would be converted into euro.

In addition, according to Article 67 of the PIL Act, if a judgment rendered by a U.S. federal or state court is not complied with, its recognition is challenged or it is necessary to enforce such judgment, a proceeding must be instituted in the competent Court of Appeal in the Republic of Italy to that end.

The United States and France are not party to a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitration awards rendered in civil and commercial matters. Accordingly, a judgment rendered by any U.S. federal or state court based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal or state securities laws, enforceable in the United States, would not be directly recognized or enforceable in France. A party in whose favor such judgment was rendered could initiate enforcement proceedings (exequatur) in France before the relevant civil court (Tribunal de Grande Instance) having jurisdiction. Enforcement in France of such U.S. judgment could be obtained following proper (i.e., non-ex parte) proceedings if the civil court is satisfied that the following conditions have been met (which conditions, under prevailing French case law, do not include a review by the French court of the merits of the foreign judgment): - the judgment concerned is enforceable in the United States; - such U.S. judgment was rendered by a court having jurisdiction over the matter in accordance with French rules of international conflicts of jurisdiction (including, without limitation, whether the dispute is clearly connected to the United States), the French courts did not have exclusive jurisdiction over the matter and the dispute was sufficiently connected to the jurisdiction in which the original action was brought; - such U.S. judgment does not contravene substantive or procedural rules of French international public policy (ordre public international); - neither the choice of jurisdiction nor the judgment rendered by the foreign court were tainted by fraud; and - such U.S. judgment does not conflict with a French judgment or a foreign judgment which has become effective in France, in the same matter, and there are no proceedings pending before French courts at the time enforcement of the judgment is sought and having the same or similar subject matter as such U.S. judgment. In addition, the discovery process under actions filed in the United States could be adversely affected under certain circumstances by French criminal law No. 68-678 of July 26, 1968, as modified by French law No. 80-538 of July 16, 1980 (relating to the communication of documents and information of an economic, commercial, industrial, financial or technical nature to foreign authorities or persons), which could prohibit or restrict obtaining evidence in France or from French persons in connection with a judicial or administrative U.S. action. Similarly, French data protection rules (law No. 78-17 of January 6, 1978 on data processing, data files and individual liberties, as modified by law No. 2004-801 of August 6, 2004) can limit under certain circumstances the possibility of obtaining information in France or from French persons in connection with a judicial or administrative U.S. action in a discovery context. Furthermore, if an original action is brought in France, French courts may refuse to apply the designated law if its application contravenes French rules of conflict (including the law chosen by the parties to govern their contract) if the application of such law (in the case at hand) is deemed to contravene: (i) mandatory rules (substantive or procedural) of international public order (ordre public _international) under French law, (ii) French overriding mandatory provisions (lois de police),_ (iii) overriding mandatory provisions (substantive or procedural) of the laws of a country in which all other elements relevant to the situation of the relevant agreement or transaction are located, or (iv) where all other elements relevant to the situation of the relevant agreement or transaction are located in one or more member States of the European Union, overriding mandatory provisions (substantive or procedural) of European Union law, as implemented in France and interpreted by French courts. Furthermore, if an original action is brought in France, French courts may refuse to apply the designated law if its application contravenes French public policy. Furthermore, in an action brought in France on the basis of U.S. federal or state securities laws, French courts may not have the requisite power to grant all of the remedies sought. 222 ----- Pursuant to articles 14 and 15 of the French Civil Code, a French national (either a company or an individual) can sue a foreign defendant before French courts (Article 14) and can be sued by a foreign claimant before French courts (Article 15).

None of the Issuer, the Guarantors or any of their subsidiaries will for a period of 180 days after the date of this Offering Memorandum, without the prior written consent of Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, offer, sell or contract to sell, or otherwise dispose of (or enter into any transaction which is designed to, or might reasonably be expected to, result in the disposition of (whether by actual disposition or effective economic disposition due to cash settlement or otherwise) by the Issuer) any debt securities similar to the Notes. The purchase prices for the Notes are the initial offering prices set forth on the cover page of this Offering Memorandum less an initial purchaser discount. The Initial Purchasers propose to offer the Notes at the initial offering prices. After the Notes are released for sale, the Initial Purchasers may change the offering price and other selling terms. The Notes have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act. The Initial Purchasers have agreed that they will only offer or sell the Notes (i) outside the United States in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act and (ii) in the United States to QIBs in reliance on Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act. The terms used above have the meanings given to them by Regulation S and Rule 144A. In connection with the sales outside the United States, the Initial Purchasers have agreed that they will not offer, sell or deliver the Notes to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons (i) as part of the Initial Purchasers’ distribution at any time or (ii) otherwise until 40 days after the later of the commencement of the Offerings or the date the Notes were originally issued. The Initial Purchasers will send to each dealer to whom they sell such Notes during such 40-day period a confirmation or other notice setting forth the restrictions on offers and sales of the Notes within the United States by a dealer or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons. In addition, until 40 days after the commencement of the Offerings, an offer or sale of any Notes within the United States by any dealer (whether or not participating in the Offerings) may violate the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act if such offer or sale is made otherwise than in accordance with Rule 144A or pursuant to another exemption from registration under the U.S. Securities Act. The Notes are a new issue of securities for which there currently is no market. We have applied, through our listing agent, to list the Notes on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and trade the Notes on the Euro MTF market, however, we cannot assure you that the Notes will be approved for listing or that such listing will be maintained. The Initial Purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market in the Notes as permitted by applicable law. The Initial Purchasers are not obligated, however, to make a market in the Notes, and any market-making activity may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the Initial Purchaser without notice. In addition, any such market-making activity will be subject to the limits imposed by the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the ‘‘U.S. Exchange Act’’). Accordingly, we cannot assure you that any market for the Notes will develop, that it will be liquid if it does develop, or that you will be able to sell any Notes at a particular time or at a price which will be favorable to you. See ‘‘Risk factors—Risks Related to the Notes and Our Structure—There is no existing public trading market for the Notes and the ability to transfer them is limited, which may adversely affect the value of the Notes.’’ Delivery of the Notes will be made against payment therefor on or about the third London business day following the date of pricing of the Notes (such settlement being referred to as ‘‘T+3’’). In connection with the Offerings, Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch (or persons acting on its behalf) may purchase and sell Notes in the open market. These transactions may include short sales, 213 ----- stabilizing transactions and purchases to cover positions created by short sales. Short sales involve the sale by Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch of a greater number of Notes than it is required to purchase in the Offerings. Stabilizing transactions consist of certain bids or purchases made for the purpose of preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of the Notes while the Offerings are in progress. These activities by Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch (or persons acting on its behalf) may stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the market price of the Notes. As a result, the price of the Notes may be higher than the price that otherwise might exist in the open market. If these activities are commenced, they may be discontinued by Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch at any time and must end no later than the earlier of 30 days after the Issue Date and 60 days after the date of the allotment of the Notes. These transactions may be effected in the over-the-counter market or otherwise.

The following standards and amendments were effective as of 1 January 2016: – In December 2013, the IASB issued Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2012-2014 Cycle, a collection of amendments to IFRSs, in response to eight issues addressed during the 2012-2014 cycle. The proposed amendments reflect issues discussed by the IASB in the project cycle that began in 2012. These amendments meet the criteria for the annual improvements process set out in the IASB Due Process Handbook. The criteria help in deciding whether a matter relating to the clarification or correction of IFRSs should be addressed using the annual improvements process. The proposed effective date for the amendments is for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016, although the IASB proposes that entities would be permitted to apply them earlier.

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on an historical cost basis, except for the measurement at fair value of Available-for-sale financial assets, Biological assets and Derivative financial instruments. The carrying values of recognized assets and liabilities that are hedged are adjusted to record changes in the fair values attributable to the hedged risks. In the process of applying Lecta Group’s accounting policies, the Management has made the following judgments: – Each consolidated company has the ability to continue as a going concern. – Recognition of risks through provisions (see Note 31). – Choice of an accounting treatment when alternative methods are allowed by existing standards. – Choice of an accounting treatment when insufficient guidance is provided by an existing standard (see Notes 1.16 and 1.17). Management of Lecta Group has also made assumptions for the years to come. Where needed Management used assumptions (inflation, interest rates, exchange rates, prices, volumes...) to develop strategies and prepare plans. The assumptions and the resulting plans are used in preparing the financial statements (e.g. computation of impairment tests, recognition of deferred income tax assets...).

Changes in accounting policies — New accounting standards,1153.52.1,,"The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year except for the following new and amended IAS, IFRS and IFRIC interpretations, effective from 1 January 2015: – IFRIC 21 Levies — IFRIC 21 is an interpretation of IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets. IAS 37 sets out criteria for the recognition of a liability, one of which is the requirement for the entity to have a present obligation as a result of a past event (known as an obligating event). The Interpretation clarifies that the obligating event that gives rise to a liability to pay a levy is the activity described in the relevant legislation that triggers the payment of the levy. The group is subject to levies, but the impact of IFRIC 21 is not material. – In December 2013, the IASB issued Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2011-2013 Cycle, a collection of amendments to IFRSs, in response to four issues addressed during the 2011-2013 cycle. The amendments reflect issues discussed by the IASB during the project cycle that began in 2011, and that were subsequently included in the Exposure Draft of proposed amendments to IFRSs, Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2011-2013 Cycle. The UE endorsed them on 17 December 2014. The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2015, although entities are permitted to apply them earlier. These amendments have no material impact on the Group. F-37 ----- The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year except for the following new and amended IAS, IFRS and IFRIC interpretations, effective from 1 January 2014: – Amendments to IAS 32 — Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities These amendments clarify the meaning of ‘‘currently has a legally enforceable right to set-off’’ and the criteria for non-simultaneous settlement mechanisms of clearing houses to qualify for offsetting. These amendments have no material impact to the Group. – Amendments to IAS 36 — Recoverable amount disclosure for non-financial assets These amendments remove the unintended consequence of IFRS 13 ‘‘Fair value measurement’’ on the disclosures required under IAS 36 ‘‘Impairment of assets’’. In addition these amendments require disclosure of the recoverable amounts for the assets or cash generating units (CGUs) for which an impairment loss has been recognized or reversed during the period. The amendment affects presentation only and has no impact on the Group’s financial position or performance. – Amendments to IAS 39 — Novation of Derivatives and Continuation of Hedge accounting These amendments provide relief from discontinuing hedge accounting when novation of a derivative designated as a hedging instrument meets certain criteria. These amendments have no material impact to the Group. F-127 -----",N/A,as_expected,2016,557

Basis of consolidation,1153.53.1,,"The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the parent company Lecta SA and its subsidiaries (including Special Purpose Entities) as at 31 December each year. Subsidiaries are entities in which Lecta Group has the sole power to exercise control over their operations. All the consolidated subsidiaries are listed in Note 2.2. Certain subsidiaries of Lecta Group are however not consolidated on the basis of immateriality (see Note 2.3). Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to Lecta Group and cease to be consolidated from the date on which Lecta loses control. Control is achieved when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. Specifically, the Group controls an investee if, and only if, the Group has: – Power over the investee (i.e. existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee); – Exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; – The ability to use its power over the investee to affect its returns. Generally, there is a presumption that a majority of voting rights result in control. To support this presumption and when the Group has less than a majority of the voting or similar rights of an investee, the Group considers all relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether it has power over an investee, including: – The contractual arrangement with the other vote holders of the investee; – Rights arising from other contractual arrangements; – The Group’s voting rights and potential voting rights. All inter-company transactions, balances and unrealized gains and losses on transactions between Lecta Group companies are eliminated on consolidation. Where local accounting policies followed by subsidiaries differ significantly from those adopted for the purpose of the consolidated financial statements, appropriate adjustments are made in order to achieve a consistent basis of accounting.

The Income statement of Lecta Group includes Lecta Group’s share of the profit or loss after tax of the associate. After application of the equity method, Lecta Group determines whether it is necessary to recognize an additional impairment loss on the Group’s investment in its associates. Lecta Group determines at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that the investment in the associate is impaired. If this is the case, Lecta Group calculates the amount of impairment as the difference between the recoverable amount of the associate and its carrying value, and recognizes the amount in the line ‘‘Share of results in associates’’ of the Income statement.

If this is the case, Lecta Group calculates the amount of impairment as the difference between the recoverable amount of the associate and its carrying value, and recognizes the amount in the line ‘‘Share of results in associates’’ of the Income statement. Lecta Group does not consolidate any associate. F-128 -----",N/A,as_expected,2016,557

The overhauls of gas turbines of cogeneration plants are capitalized as Property, plant and equipment and depreciated over 3 to 6 years. If the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree is remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date through profit or loss. Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer is recognized at fair value at the acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration which is deemed to be an asset or liability, are recognized in accordance with IAS 39 either in profit or loss or as a change to other comprehensive income. If the contingent consideration is classified as equity, it is not remeasured until it is finally settled within equity. Goodwill is initially measured at cost being the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the amount recognized for non-controlling interest over the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If this consideration is lower than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference (formerly known as negative goodwill) is recognized in profit or loss in the line ‘‘Non-recurring items’’ of the Income statement. After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. _Business combinations prior to 1 January 2009_ In comparison to the above-mentioned requirements, the following differences applied: Business combinations were accounted for using the purchase method. Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition formed part of the acquisition costs. The non-controlling interest (or non-controlling interest) was measured at the proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. Business combinations achieved in stages were accounted for as separate steps. Any additional acquired share of interest did not affect previously recognized goodwill. Contingent consideration was recognized if, and only if, the Group had a present obligation, the economic outflow was more likely than not and a reliable estimate was determinable. Subsequent adjustments to the contingent consideration were recognized as part of goodwill. Initially, all financial assets are recognized at their fair value, plus in the case of a Financial asset not at fair value through profit or loss transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of the said financial asset. Then the accounting rules differ from one category to another: _Available-for-sale financial assets are acquired to be held for an indefinite period of time but may_ be sold due to changed strategic decisions. After initial recognition, they are measured at fair value. Gains or losses are directly recognized in the line ‘‘Net incomes (expenses) recognized directly through Equity’’ of the Statement of financial position, until the investment is sold, collected or otherwise disposed of, or until the investment is determined to be impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously reported in Equity is included in the line ‘‘Non-recurring items’’ of the Income statement. Call and put options on shares of non-consolidated companies (derivatives held for trading) are accounted for at fair value in the lines ‘‘Other receivables’’ or ‘‘Other payables’’ of the Statement of financial position. Changes in the fair value are entered in the line ‘‘Non-recurring items’’ of the Income statement. In Lecta Group, Available-for-sale investments are shares in companies that are not consolidated on the basis of immateriality or because of the low ownership. They are reported in the line ‘‘Available-for-sale financial investments’’, in Non-current assets of the Statement of financial position. _Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss include financial assets held for trading and_ financial assets designated upon initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss. Financial assets are classified as held for trading if they are acquired for the purpose of selling or repurchasing in the near term. After initial recognition, they are measured at fair value. Gains or losses are recognized in the lines ‘‘Financial income’’ and ‘‘Financial expense’’ of the Income statement. In Lecta Group, Investments at fair value through the profit or loss are money market funds used to safely invest temporary excess cash. They are included in the line ‘‘Cash and cash equivalents’’, in the Current assets of the Statement of financial position. _Held-to-maturity investments are acquired with the intent to hold them to their fixed maturity_ (e.g. bonds). Held-to-maturity investments are included in the line ‘‘Other non-current receivables’’, in the Non-current assets of the Statement of financial position. After initial recognition, they are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method. Amortized cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition, over the period to maturity. Gains and losses are recognized in the line ‘‘Finance costs’’ of the Income statement when the investments are derecognized or impaired, as well as through the amortization process. Lecta Group does not hold such investments. _Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that_ are not quoted in an active market. After initial recognition, they are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method. Amortized cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition, over the period to maturity. Gains and losses are recognized in the line ‘‘Non-recurring items’’ of the Income statement when the investments are derecognized or impaired, as well as through the amortization process. F-44 ----- This category comprises for Lecta Group: – the Trade receivables (see Note 1.23); – the financial investments originated by the group included in the line ‘‘Other non-current assets’’ in the Non-current assets of the Statement of financial position (see Notes 1.25 and 1.34): – deposits, – guarantees, – loans to non-consolidated companies or third parties. _Date of recognition_ All sales and purchases of financial assets are recognized using the settlement date, i.e. the date the asset is delivered to or received from the counterpart. Included in this category are all sales or purchases of financial assets that require delivery of assets within the timeframe generally established by regulation or convention in the market place. _Derecognition_ See Note 1.37. Cost is computed according to the weighted average cost method. Net realizable value is based on estimated selling price, less further costs expected to be incurred to completion and disposal. Given the lack of meaningful market references, the inventoried spare parts are impaired in accordance with slow moving rules reflecting their obsolescence. After initial recognition, they are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method. Amortized cost is calculated by taking into account any issue costs and any discount or premium on settlement. Gains and losses are recognized in the lines ‘‘Financial income’’ and ‘‘Financial expense’’ of the Income statement, when the liabilities are derecognized or impaired, as well as through the amortization process. Lecta Group applies IAS 23 (revised) — Borrowing Costs as of 1 January 2009. Since the related criteria were not met in 2009 and 2010, Lecta Group did not recognize any borrowing cost in the long-lived assets until 31 December 2010. In 2011, some borrowing cost in the long-lived assets were capitalized (see Note 12). _Financial liabilities at fair value through the profit or loss include financial liabilities held for trading_ and financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition as at fair value through profit or loss. Financial liabilities are classified as held for trading if they are acquired for the purpose of selling in the near term. Derivatives, including separated embedded derivatives are also classified as held for trading unless they are designated as effective hedging instruments. After initial recognition, they are measured at fair value. Gains or losses are recognized in the lines ‘‘Financial income’’ and ‘‘Financial expense’’ of the Income statement. In Lecta Group, no financial liabilities were designated as at fair value through profit or loss. – Defined contribution post-employment plans: The cost to the employer is fixed and predictable. The charge for the period is the contribution due in respect of the service rendered during the period. Payments in advance are reported in the line ‘‘Prepayments’’ of the Statement of financial position. Payments in arrears are reported in the line ‘‘Trade payables’’ of the Statement of financial position. Any accrual that does not fall due within 12 months beyond Statement of financial position date is discounted and recognized at its present value. – Defined benefit post-employment plans: The employer retains a risk of additional contributions to be paid. The plan is valued in the Statement of financial position at the present value of the obligation less the fair value of any plan assets legally separate from the employer. Any unrecognized past service costs, is immediately recognized. All actuarial gains or losses are immediately recognized. For any curtailment or settlement, the resulting change is immediately recognized. – Other long-term benefits: These include long-service or jubilee benefits. All actuarial gains or losses and any past service costs are immediately recognized. – Termination benefits: These include early retirement schemes or redundancy programs. They are recognized as a liability and an expense when and only when a company of Lecta Group is demonstrably committed to terminate the employment of a group of employees before the normal retirement date or provide termination benefits as a result of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy. Lecta Group employees do not benefit from Equity compensation benefits plan or share based payments plan. The employee benefits may be funded, resulting in a debt obligation with financial institutions, or unfunded, resulting in the booking of a provision. Independent qualified actuaries review any material long-term obligation of Lecta Group. The costs are accounted for as follows: – The actuarial gains and losses of Defined benefit post-employment plans are directly recognized in the lines ‘‘Net incomes (expenses) recognized directly through Equity’’ and ‘‘Deferred tax’’ of the Statement of financial position. – All the other costs are recognized in the Income statement, in the following lines: – Costs related to active employees: ‘‘Labor costs’’. – Costs related to retired people: ‘‘Other operating costs except non-recurring items’’. – Costs due to the time value of money: ‘‘Financial expense’’. Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for all taxable temporary differences (e.g. accelerated tax depreciation, deductible legal revaluation), except (i) where the deferred tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss, or (ii) in respect of taxable temporary differences that will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets are recognized for all deductible temporary differences (e.g. employee benefits paid to financial institutions for which the deductibility is deferred), carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available to use these assets. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilized. Unrecognized deferred tax assets are reassessed at each reporting date and are recognized to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profits will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realized or the liability settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the Statement of financial position date. Deferred tax relating to items recognized outside the Income statement is also recognized outside the Income statement, i.e. in the Statement of comprehensive income or directly in Equity in the Statement of financial position. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset, if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current income tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority. The discounted value of the exercise price of a sold option or a firm commitment, at inception and at each year-end, is recorded in the line ‘‘Other payables’’ against the line ‘‘Non-controlling interests’’. Since 1 January 2009 and in accordance with IAS27 (revised), when a sold option or a firm commitment on minorities is exercised, the amount in Other payables is reversed against Cash, and the remaining balances of non-controlling interests and Equity derivatives are reversed against Equity. Where continuing involvement takes the form of a written and / or purchased option (including a cash settled option or similar provision) on the transferred asset, the extent of the Group’s continuing involvement is the amount of the transferred asset that the Group may repurchase, except that in the case of a written put option (including a cash settled option or similar provision) on an asset measured at fair value, the extent of the Group’s continuing involvement is limited to the lower of the fair value of the transferred asset and the option exercise price. _Financial liabilities_ A financial liability is derecognized when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expired. – IFRS 16 ‘‘Leases’’ was issued in January 2016. It replaces IAS 17 ‘‘Leases’’. The major change introduced by the new Standard is that leases will be brought onto companies’ balance sheets, increasing the visibility of their assets and liabilities. IFRS 16 removes the classification of leases as either operating leases or finance leases (for the lessee — the lease customer), treating all leases as finance leases. The new standard is applicable for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019. Lecta Group is in the process of analyzing the impact of this standard on the group. Recurring maintenance or day-to-day servicing costs (outside contractors, felt & wires...) are always expensed. The overhauls of gas turbines of cogeneration plants are capitalized as Property, plant and equipment and depreciated over 3 to 6 years. When the Group acquires a business, it assesses the financial assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate classification and designation in accordance with the contractual terms, economic circumstances and pertinent conditions as at the acquisition date. If the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree is remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date through profit or loss. Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer is recognized at fair value at the acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration which is deemed to be an asset or liability, are recognized in accordance with IAS 39 either in profit or loss or as a change to other comprehensive income. If the contingent consideration is classified as equity, it is not remeasured until it is finally settled within equity. Goodwill is initially measured at cost being the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the amount recognized for non-controlling interest over the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If this consideration is lower than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference (formerly known as negative goodwill) is recognized in profit or loss in the line ‘‘Non-recurring items’’ of the Income statement. After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. _Business combinations prior to 1 January 2009_ In comparison to the above-mentioned requirements, the following differences applied: Business combinations were accounted for using the purchase method.

Lecta Group does not hold such investments. _Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that_ are not quoted in an active market. After initial recognition, they are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method. Amortized cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition, over the period to maturity. Gains and losses are recognized in the line ‘‘Non-recurring items ‘‘of the Income statement when the investments are derecognized or impaired, as well as through the amortization process. This category comprises for Lecta Group: – the Trade receivables (see Note 1.23); – the financial investments originated by the group included in the line ‘‘Other non-current assets’’ in the Non-current assets of the Statement of financial position (see Notes 1.25 and 1.34): – deposits, – guarantees, – loans to non-consolidated companies or third parties. _Date of recognition_ All sales and purchases of financial assets are recognized using the settlement date, i.e. the date the asset is delivered to or received from the counterpart. Included in this category are all sales or purchases of financial assets that require delivery of assets within the timeframe generally established by regulation or convention in the market place. _Derecognition_ See Note 1.37. – A reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made. Where Lecta Group expects the impact of a provision to be neutralized, for example under an insurance contract, a separate asset is recognized when it is virtually certain. If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. Where discounting is used, the change of the provision due to the time value of money is recognized in the lines ‘‘Financial income’’ or ‘‘Financial expense’’ in the Income statement. The costs are accounted for as follows: – The actuarial gains and losses of Defined benefit post-employment plans are directly recognized in the lines ‘‘Net incomes (expenses) recognized directly through Equity’’ and ‘‘Deferred tax’’ of the Statement of financial position. – All the other costs are recognized in the Income statement, in the following lines: – Costs related to active employees: ‘‘Labor costs’’. – Costs related to retired people: ‘‘Other operating costs except non-recurring items’’. – Costs due to the time value of money: ‘‘Financial expense’’. New amended IAS or interpretations effective as of 1 January 2016: – In December 2013, the IASB issued Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2010-2012 Cycle, a collection of amendments to IFRSs, in response to eight issues addressed during the 2010-2012 cycle. The UE endorsed them on 17 December 2014. The amendments reflect issues discussed by the IASB during the project cycle that began in 2010, and that were subsequently included in the exposure draft of proposed amendments to IFRSs, Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2010-2012 Cycle. The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 February 2015, although entities are permitted to apply them earlier.

After initial recognition, they are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method. Amortized cost is calculated by taking into account any issue costs and any discount or premium on settlement. Gains and losses are recognized in the lines ‘‘Financial income’’ and ‘‘Financial expense’’ of the Income statement, when the liabilities are derecognized or impaired, as well as through the amortization process. Lecta Group applies IAS 23 (revised) — Borrowing Costs as of 1 January 2009.

In 2011, some borrowing cost in the long-lived assets were capitalized (see Note 12). _Financial liabilities at fair value through the profit or loss include financial liabilities held for trading_ and financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition as at fair value through profit or loss. Financial liabilities are classified as held for trading if they are acquired for the purpose of selling in the near term. Derivatives, including separated embedded derivatives are also classified as held for trading unless they are designated as effective hedging instruments.

Future changes in accounting policies,1153.98.1,,"New amended IAS or interpretations effective as of 1 January 2016: – In December 2013, the IASB issued Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2012-2014 Cycle, a collection of amendments to IFRSs, in response to eight issues addressed during the 2012-2014 cycle. The proposed amendments reflect issues discussed by the IASB in the project cycle that began in 2012. These amendments meet the criteria for the annual improvements process set out in the IASB Due Process Handbook. The criteria help in deciding whether a matter relating to the clarification or correction of IFRSs should be addressed using the annual improvements process. The proposed effective date for the amendments is for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016, although the IASB proposes that entities would be permitted to apply them earlier. New amended IAS or interpretations effective as of 1 January 2017: – In January 2016, the IASB issued amendments to IAS 12 Income Taxes. The amendments, Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealized Losses (Amendments to IAS 12), clarify how to account for deferred tax assets related to debt instruments measured at fair value. IAS 12 provides requirements on the recognition and measurement of current or deferred tax liabilities or assets. The issued amendments clarify the requirements on recognition of deferred tax assets for unrealized losses to address diversity in practice. Entities are required to apply the amendments for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017. Earlier application is permitted. New amended IAS or interpretations effective as of 1 January 2018: – In July 2014, the IASB completed the final element of its comprehensive response to the financial crisis by issuing IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (replacement of IAS 39). The package of improvements introduced by IFRS 9 includes a logical model for classification and measurement, a single, forward-looking ‘expected loss’ impairment model and a substantiallyreformed approach to hedge accounting. The new Standard will come into effect on 1 January 2018 with early application permitted. Lecta Group is evaluating the effects of the above standards applicable as from 1 January 2016, 1 January 2017 and 1 January 2018 and expects that their adoption will have no material impact on the financial statements. Additionally, Lecta Group started the analysis of IFRS 15 ‘‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’’ and IFRS 16 ‘‘Leases’’ effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 and 1 January 2019, respectively. – IFRS 15 ‘‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’’ was issued in May 2014 and establishes a five-step model to account for revenue arising from contracts with customers. Under IFRS 15, revenue is recognized at an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer. The new revenue standard will supersede all current revenue recognition requirements under IFRS. The new standard is applicable for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. Lecta Group is in the process of analyzing the impact of this standard on the group. F-51 ----- New amended IAS or interpretations effective as of 1 January 2015: – IFRIC 21 Levies — IFRIC 21 is an interpretation of IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets. IAS 37 sets out criteria for the recognition of a liability, one of which is the requirement for the entity to have a present obligation as a result of a past event (known as an obligating event). The Interpretation clarifies that the obligating event that gives rise to a liability to pay a levy is the activity described in the relevant legislation that triggers the payment of the levy. The group is subject to some levies but the impact is zero at year-end. – IAS 19 Defined benefit plans — Employee Contributions (Amendments to IAS 19). The pronouncement amends IAS 19 Employee Benefits (2011) to clarify the requirements that relate to how contributions from employees or third parties that are linked to service should be attributed to periods of service. In addition, it permits a practical expedient if the amount of the contributions is independent of the number of years of service, in that contributions, can, but are not required, to be recognized as a reduction in the service cost in the period in which the related service is rendered. – In December 2013, the IASB issued Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2011-2013 Cycle, a collection of amendments to IFRSs, in response to four issues addressed during the 2011-2013 cycle. The amendments reflect issues discussed by the IASB during the project cycle that began in 2011, and that were subsequently included in the Exposure Draft of proposed amendments to IFRSs, Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2011-2013 Cycle. The UE endorsed them on 17 December 2014.

CO2 emission rights,1153.143.1,,"In order to comply with the Kyoto protocol, the European Union has set up the CO2 (or Greenhouse Gas) emission rights scheme. Lecta Group elected to use the implicit rule of IAS 20 ‘‘Accounting for government grants and disclosure of government assistance’’ to account for the CO2 emission rights. This rule is sometimes referred to as ‘‘net liability method’’: According to the ‘‘net liability method’’, the rights that have been granted free of charge by each National Authority are not recognized. A provision at fair value is recognized for the tons of CO2 emitted in excess of the rights granted by each National Authority. Purchased rights are initially recognized at cost in the line ‘‘Other intangible assets’’ of the Statement of financial position. After initial recognition, the purchased rights that are not in excess of the above-mentioned provisioned tons are measured at fair value. The rights in excess are kept at their historical cost, unless the market price drops below this cost. In such a case, these rights are impaired. All the movements in the Income statement are reported in the line ‘‘Other operating costs except non-recurring items’’. These rules are implemented separately for each Subsidiary, because National Authorities grant the rights to single companies.",N/A,as_expected,2016,557

Impairment of certain long-lived assets,1153.150.1,,"Property, plant and equipment, Investment properties and Other intangible assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. This review is done each year for the Goodwill and other indefinite life intangible assets. Where the carrying values exceed the estimated recoverable amount, the asset or the associated cash-generating unit is written down to its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the greater of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. Impairment losses are recognized in the line ‘‘Non-recurring items’’ in the Income statement.",N/A,as_expected,2016,557

Where the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from an asset and has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset nor transferred control of the asset, the asset is recognized to the extent of the Group’s continuing involvement in the asset. Continuing involvement that takes the form of a guarantee over the transferred asset is measured at the lower of the original carrying amount of the asset and the maximum amount of consideration that the Group could be required to repay. Where continuing involvement takes the form of a written and / or purchased option (including a cash settled option or similar provision) on the transferred asset, the extent of the Group’s continuing involvement is the amount of the transferred asset that the Group may repurchase, except that in the case of a written put option (including a cash settled option or similar provision) on an asset measured at fair value, the extent of the Group’s continuing involvement is limited to the lower of the fair value of the transferred asset and the option exercise price. _Financial liabilities_ A financial liability is derecognized when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expired.",N/A,as_expected,2016,557

(2) Due to the change in TFR regulation, applied as of 2007, the future salaries were subject to monthly social security contributions only. A quantitative sensitivity analysis for the discount rate as at 31 December 2015 is shown below: ‘‘Mobilit`a 2’’:_ This termination plan was opened until 15 September 2014, date on which 50 employees had left the company with Mobilit`a and 3 employees were incentivized to leave from the Company and the termination of the contract of 2 agents was managed. There was no premium paid at inception. The fair value of the purchased call option cannot be reliably measured. The impact of these contracts has been accounted for as fair value hedging, hence recognized in the Income statement (see Note 1.36). At 31 December 2015, there were no options on future sales in foreign currencies and on future purchases in foreign currencies. Therefore, nothing had to be fair valued through Income statement. Furthermore, in June 2007, Alto Garda Power SrL entered into a 13-year agreement with Italia General Electric SpA, in order to execute the planned maintenance of the new cogeneration plant for the period 2008 to 2020. As the payments of this agreement had to be made in USD, on 20 September 2007, Alto Garda Power SrL entered into several currency forward contracts for the purpose of hedging part of its maintenance costs against any unexpected fluctuation of exchange rate of USD until 20 December 2014. The impact of these contracts has been accounted for as cash flow hedge. The intrinsic value, considered as effective, was recognized directly in Equity while the time value was considered as ineffective, and thus recognized in the Income statement (see Note 1.36). The main characteristics of the above instruments are as follows. As at 31 December 2015, Lecta Group held the following financial instruments: The table below illustrates how a change in selected factors (on the assumption that other factors are neutral) related to Lecta Group’s business may affect financial performances.

Consequently, goodwill was tested for impairment at Group level only. This is consistent with the Note 5 prepared in accordance with IFRS 8 ‘‘Operating Segments’’. The recoverable amount of this cash-generating unit has been determined based on value-in-use calculation (see Note 1.21). This was produced based upon 2016 to 2019 cash-flow projections part of Lecta financial plan, as approved by Lecta Group Management. As mentioned in Note 1.01, Lecta Group Management made assumptions for the years to come. Conservative assumptions on the annual growth rate were applied to the cash flow projections beyond 2019. The WACC rate applied to cash flow projections was 9.4% (against 9.7% in 2014). On 31 December 2015, the impairment test was successfully passed and no impairment was recognized.

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing as adopted for Luxembourg by the ‘‘Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier’’. Those standards require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the judgement of the ‘‘r´eviseurd’entreprises agr´e´e’’, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the ‘‘r´eviseurd’entreprises agr´e´e’’ considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internalcontrol. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the Board of Directors, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. _Opinion_ In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of Lecta S.A. as of 31 December 2014, and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union.

NA[(2)] NA[(2)] (1) Didn’t apply because the pension was based on the salary of each beneficiary at the age of 42. (2) Due to the change in TFR regulation, applied as of 2007, the future salaries were subject to monthly social security contributions only. A quantitative sensitivity analysis for the discount rate as at 31 December 2013 is shown below: – Non-recourse invoice discounting and factoring: The residual commitment computed using the continuous involvement methodology is accounted for in the borrowings and disclosed in Note 28.4. The face value of these discounted invoices was EUR 41.7 M as at 31 December 2013. – Non-recourse assignment: In such case, there is no residual commitment. In December 2012, Alto Garda Power SrL voluntarily repaid EUR 12 M of its debt. Following this repayment, the notional amounts of the Collar and the Swap were higher than the debt. Consequently, the Collar and part of the Swap were considered as hedging instruments, while the balance of the Swap was no more considered as hedging instrument. On 18 December 2013, the Swap to exchange 6 month Euribor variable rate was terminated. _IDAE Sant Joan AIE:_ On 23 July 2010, the interest rates of 75% of the forecast debt in IDAE Sant Joan AIE (see Note 28.4) were hedged with a Swap to exchange 1 month Euribor variable rate against fixed rate of 2.14% for the period from June 2011 to March 2016. The main characteristics of the above instruments are as follows. Lecta Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuation technique: – Level 1: quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities – Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs that have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly. – Level 3: techniques that use inputs that have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data. As at 31 December 2013, Lecta Group held the following financial instruments:",N/A,as_expected,2016,557

Consequently, goodwill was tested for impairment at Group level only. This is consistent with the Note 5 prepared in accordance with IFRS 8 ‘‘Operating Segments’’. The recoverable amount of this cash-generating unit has been determined based on value-in-use calculation (see Note 1.21). This was produced based upon 2015 to 2018 cash-flow projections part of Lecta financial plan, as approved by Lecta Group Management. As mentioned in Note 1.01, Lecta Group Management made assumptions for the years to come. Conservative assumptions on the annual growth rate were applied to the cash flow projections beyond 2017. The WACC rate applied to cash flow projections was 9.7%. On 31 December 2014, the impairment test was successfully passed and no impairment was recognized. A sensitivity analysis showed that: – An increase of 100 bps of the WACC rate applied to cash flow projections, from 9.7% to 10.7%, everything else being equal, has an unfavorable impact of EUR 69 M. It would result in impairment of the Goodwill. – A reduction of 10% in EBITDA applied to the period 2015 to 2018 and beyond 2018, everything else being equal, has an unfavorable impact of EUR 63 M. It would not result in impairment of the Goodwill.

According to the partnership agreement signed in December 2007 between Torraspapel SA and IDAE (Spanish Public Entity), IDAE shall remain as a partner in IDAE Sant Joan AIE until it recovers its investment plus a remuneration of 3-month Euribor + 4%. Once the first five years as of start-off of the cogeneration plant (August 2011) have elapsed, Torraspapel SA may also request the assignment of IDAE’s share participation in IDAE Sant Joan AIE. For that purpose, Torraspapel SA would have to pay IDAE an amount equal to its investment plus the referred remuneration once deducted any amounts already reimbursed to IDAE by any means. In both cases, assignment is only possible if: – All loans granted to of IDAE Sant Joan AIE by any third parties have been previously repaid – Or the relevant creditors specifically waive all claims against IDAE.

Basis of preparation,1157.4.1,,"The consolidated financial statements of Lecta Group have been prepared in accordance with the Standards and Interpretations adopted by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and by the E.U. applicable as at 1 January 2013. They comprise: – International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), – International Accounting Standards (IAS), – Interpretations originated by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) or the former Standing Interpretations Committee (SIC). The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on an historical cost basis, except for the measurement at fair value of Available-for-sale financial assets, Biological assets and Derivative financial instruments. The carrying values of recognized assets and liabilities that are hedged are adjusted to record changes in the fair values attributable to the hedged risks. In the process of applying Lecta Group’s accounting policies, the Management has made the following judgments: – Each consolidated company has the ability to continue as a going concern. – Recognition of risks through provisions (see Note 31). – Choice of an accounting treatment when alternative methods are allowed by existing standards. – Choice of an accounting treatment when insufficient guidance is provided by an existing standard (see Notes 1.16 and 1.17). Management of Lecta Group has also made assumptions for the years to come. Where needed Management used assumptions (inflation, interest rates, exchange rates, prices, volumes...) to develop strategies and prepare plans. The assumptions and the resulting plans are used in preparing the financial statements (e.g. computation of impairment tests, recognition of Deferred income tax assets...). Actual results may differ from these estimates.",N/A,as_expected,2016,557

Changes in accounting policies — New accounting standards,1157.5.1,,"The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year except as follows: Lecta Group adopted the following new and amended IAS, IFRS and IFRIC interpretations during the year 2013. When their adoption is deemed to have an impact on the financial statements of Lecta Group, such impact is described below. – IAS 1 Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive Income — Amendments to IAS 1: The amendments to IAS 1 change the grouping of items presented in other comprehensive income (OCI). Items that can be reclassified (or ‘recycled’) to profit or loss at a future point in time are presented separately from items that will never be reclassified. The amendment affects presentation only and has no impact on the Group’s financial position or performance. – IAS 19 Employee Benefits (Revised) The revised standard includes a number of amendments that range from fundamental changes to simple clarifications and re-wording. The more significant changes include the following: - For defined benefit plans, the ability to defer recognition of actuarial gains and losses has been removed. As revised, amounts recorded in profit or loss are limited to current and past service costs, gains or losses on settlements, and net interest income . All other changes in the F-224 -----",N/A,as_expected,2016,557
172_2,Offerings 2016.md,1157,CASH FLOWS FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES,1157.6,NOTES — (Continued),1157.6.1,,"net defined benefit asset (liability), including actuarial gains and losses, are recognized in OCI with no subsequent recycling to profit or loss. - Expected returns on plan assets are no longer recognized in profit or loss. Expected returns are replaced by recording interest income in profit or loss, which is calculated using the discount rate used to measure the pension obligation. - The new disclosures include quantitative information about the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to a reasonably possible change in each significant actuarial assumption. - Termination benefits are recognized at the earlier of when the offer of termination cannot be withdrawn, or when the related restructuring costs are recognized under IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets. - The distinction between short-term and other long-term employee benefits is based on the expected timing of settlement rather than the employee’s entitlement to the benefits. The amendment represents a significant further step in reporting gains and losses outside of profit or loss, with no subsequent recycling. Actuarial gains and losses are excluded permanently from profit or loss. IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures (as revised in 2011) As a consequence of the new IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements, and IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities, IAS 28 Investments in Associates, has been renamed IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures, and describes the application of the equity method to investments in joint ventures in addition to associates. IFRS 7 Disclosures — Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities — Amendments to IFRS 7 These amendments require an entity to disclose information about rights to set-off and related arrangements. The disclosures would provide users with information that is useful in evaluating the effect of netting arrangements on an entity’s financial position. The new disclosures are required for all recognized financial instruments that are set off in accordance with IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation. The disclosures also apply to recognized financial instruments that are subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement, irrespective of whether they are set off in accordance with IAS 32. IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements, IAS 27 Separate Financial Statements IFRS 10 replaces the portion of IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements that addresses the accounting for consolidated financial statements. It also addresses the issues raised in SIC-12 Consolidation -Special Purpose Entities. IFRS 10 establishes a single control model that applies to all entities including special purpose entities. The changes introduced by IFRS 10 requires management to exercise significant judgment to determine which entities are controlled and therefore are required to be consolidated by a parent, compared with the requirements that were in IAS 27. IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements. IFRS 11 replaces IAS 31 Interests in Joint Ventures and SIC-13 Jointly-controlled Entities — Non-monetary Contributions by Venturers. Joint control under IFRS 11 is defined as the contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when the decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. ‘Control’ in ‘joint control’ refers to the definition of ‘control’ in IFRS 10. IFRS 11 also changes the accounting for joint arrangements by moving from three categories under IAS 31 to the following two categories: - Joint operation — an arrangement in which the parties with joint control have rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities relating to that arrangement. In respect of its interest in a joint operation, a joint operator must recognize all of its assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, including its relative share of jointly controlled assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. F-225 ----- - Joint venture — an arrangement in which the parties with joint control have rights to the net assets of the arrangement. Joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method. IFRS 12 Disclosure of Involvement with Other Entities IFRS 12 applies to an entity that has an interest in subsidiaries, joint arrangements, associates and/or structured entities. Many of the disclosure requirements of IFRS 12 were previously included in IAS 27, IAS 31, and IAS 28, while others are new. The new disclosures will assist users to make their own assessment of the financial impact of management’s conclusion regarding consolidation. IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement IFRS 13 establishes a single source of guidance under IFRS for all fair value measurements. IFRS 13 does not change when an entity is required to use fair value, but rather provides guidance on how to measure fair value under IFRS when fair value is required or permitted. IFRS 13 defines fair value as an exit price. It is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value as used in IFRS 2 Share-based Payments and IAS 17 Leases is excluded from the scope of IFRS 13. Additional disclosures where required, are provided in the individual notes relating to the assets and liabilities whose fair values were determined. Lecta Group does not consolidate any associate. Recurring maintenance or day-to-day servicing costs (outside contractors, felt & wires...) are always expensed. The overhauls of gas turbines of cogeneration plants are capitalized as Property, plant and equipment and depreciated over 3 to 6 years. If the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree is remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date through profit or loss. Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer is recognized at fair value at the acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration which is deemed to be an asset or liability, are recognized in accordance with IAS 39 either in profit or loss or as a change to other comprehensive income. If the contingent consideration is classified as equity, it is not remeasured until it is finally settled within equity. Goodwill is initially measured at cost being the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the amount recognized for non-controlling interest over the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If this consideration is lower than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference (formerly known as negative goodwill) is recognized in profit or loss in the line ‘‘Non recurring items’’ of the Income statement. After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. _Business combinations prior to 1 January 2009_ In comparison to the above-mentioned requirements, the following differences applied: Business combinations were accounted for using the purchase method. Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition formed part of the acquisition costs. The non-controlling interest (or non controlling interest ) was measured at the proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. Business combinations achieved in stages were accounted for as separate steps. Any additional acquired share of interest did not affect previously recognized goodwill. Contingent consideration was recognized if, and only if, the Group had a present obligation, the economic outflow was more likely than not and a reliable estimate was determinable. Subsequent adjustments to the contingent consideration were recognized as part of goodwill. Initially, all financial assets are recognized at their fair value, plus in the case of a Financial asset not at fair value through profit or loss transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of the said financial asset. Then the accounting rules differ from one category to another: _Available-for-sale financial assets are acquired to be held for an indefinite period of time but may_ be sold due to changed strategic decisions. After initial recognition, they are measured at fair value. Gains or losses are directly recognized in the line ‘‘Net incomes (expenses) recognized directly through Equity’’ of the Statement of financial position, until the investment is sold, collected or otherwise disposed of, or until the investment is determined to be impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously reported in Equity is included in the line ‘‘Non recurring items ’’ of the Income statement. Call and put options on shares of non-consolidated companies (derivatives held for trading) are accounted for at fair value in the lines ‘‘Other receivables’’ or ‘‘Other payables’’ of the Statement of financial position . Changes in the fair value are entered in the line ‘‘Non recurring items ’’ of the Income statement. In Lecta Group, Available-for-sale investments are shares in companies that are not consolidated on the basis of immateriality or because of the low ownership. They are reported in the line ‘‘Available-for-sale financial investments’’, in Non-current assets of the Statement of financial position . _Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss include financial assets held for trading and_ financial assets designated upon initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss. Financial assets are classified as held for trading if they are acquired for the purpose of selling or repurchasing in the near term. After initial recognition, they are measured at fair value. Gains or losses are recognized in the lines ‘‘Financial income’’ and ‘‘Financial expense’’ of the Income statement. In Lecta Group, Investments at fair value through the profit or loss are money market funds used to safely invest temporary excess cash. They are included in the line ‘‘Cash and cash equivalents’’, in the Current assets of the Statement of financial position . _Held-to-maturity investments are acquired with the intent to hold them to their fixed maturity_ (e.g. bonds). Held-to-maturity investments are included in the line ‘‘Other non-current receivables’’, in the Non-current assets of the Statement of financial position . After initial recognition, they are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method. Amortized cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition, over the period to maturity. Gains and losses are recognized in the line ‘‘Finance costs’’ of the Income statement when the investments are derecognized or impaired, as well as through the amortization process. Lecta Group does not hold such investments. _Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that_ are not quoted in an active market. After initial recognition, they are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method. Amortized cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition, over the period to maturity. Gains and losses are recognized in the line ‘‘Non recurring items ’’ of the Income statement when the investments are derecognized or impaired, as well as through the amortization process. F-232 ----- This category comprises for Lecta Group: – the Trade receivables (see Note 1.23); – the financial investments originated by the group included in the line ‘‘Other non-current assets’’ in the Non-current assets of the Statement of financial position (see Notes 1.25 and 1.34): – deposits, – guarantees, – loans to non-consolidated companies or third parties. _Date of recognition_ All sales and purchases of financial assets are recognized using the settlement date, i.e. the date the asset is delivered to or received from the counterpart. Included in this category are all sales or purchases of financial assets that require delivery of assets within the timeframe generally established by regulation or convention in the market place. _Derecognition_ See Note 1.37. Cost is computed according to the weighted average cost method. Net realizable value is based on estimated selling price, less further costs expected to be incurred to completion and disposal. Given the lack of meaningful market references, the inventoried spare parts are impaired in accordance with slow moving rules reflecting their obsolescence. After initial recognition, they are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method. Amortized cost is calculated by taking into account any issue costs and any discount or premium on settlement. Gains and losses are recognized in the lines ‘‘Financial income’’ and ‘‘Financial expense’’ of the Income statement, when the liabilities are derecognized or impaired, as well as through the amortization process. Lecta Group applies IAS 23 (revised) — Borrowing Costs as of 1 January 2009. Since the related criteria were not met in 2009 and 2010, Lecta Group did not recognize any borrowing cost in the long-lived assets until 31 December 2010. In 2011, some borrowing cost in the long-lived assets were capitalized (see Note 12). _Financial liabilities at fair value through the profit or loss include financial liabilities held for trading_ and financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition as at fair value through profit or loss. Financial liabilities are classified as held for trading if they are acquired for the purpose of selling in the near term. Derivatives, including separated embedded derivatives are also classified as held for trading unless they are designated as effective hedging instruments. After initial recognition, they are measured at fair value. Gains or losses are recognized in the lines ‘‘Financial income’’ and ‘‘Financial expense’’ of the Income statement. In Lecta Group, no financial liabilities were designated as at fair value through profit or loss. – Defined contribution post-employment plans: The cost to the employer is fixed and predictable. The charge for the period is the contribution due in respect of the service rendered during the period. Payments in advance are reported in the line ‘‘Prepayments’’ of the Statement of financial position . Payments in arrears are reported in the line ‘‘Trade payables’’ of the Statement of financial position . Any accrual that does not fall due within 12 months beyond Statement of financial position date is discounted and recognized at its present value. – Defined benefit post-employment plans: The employer retains a risk of additional contributions to be paid. The plan is valued in the Statement of financial position at the present value of the obligation less the fair value of any plan assets legally separate from the employer. Any unrecognized past service costs, is immediately recognized. All actuarial gains or losses are immediately recognized. For any curtailment or settlement, the resulting change is immediately recognized. – Other long-term benefits: These include long-service or jubilee benefits. All actuarial gains or losses and any past service costs are immediately recognized. – Termination benefits: These include early retirement schemes or redundancy programs. They are recognized as a liability and an expense when and only when a company of Lecta Group is demonstrably committed to terminate the employment of a group of employees before the normal retirement date or provide termination benefits as a result of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy. Lecta Group employees do not benefit from Equity compensation benefits plan or share based payments plan. The employee benefits may be funded, resulting in a debt obligation with financial institutions, or unfunded, resulting in the booking of a provision. Independent qualified actuaries review any material long-term obligation of Lecta Group. The costs are accounted for as follows: – The actuarial gains and losses of Defined benefit post-employment plans are directly recognized in the lines ‘‘Net incomes (expenses) recognized directly through Equity’’ and ‘‘Deferred tax’’ of the Statement of financial position . – All the other costs are recognized in the Income statement, in the following lines: – Costs related to active employees: ‘‘Labor costs’’. – Costs related to retired people: ‘‘Other operating costs except non recurring items ’’. – Costs due to the time value of money: ‘‘Financial expense’’. combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss, or (ii) in respect of taxable temporary differences that will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax _assets are recognized for all deductible temporary differences (e.g. employee benefits paid to financial institutions for which the deductibility is deferred), carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available to use these assets. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilized. Unrecognized deferred tax assets are reassessed at each reporting date and are recognized to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profits will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realized or the liability settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the Statement of financial position date. Deferred tax relating to items recognized outside the Income statement is also recognized outside the Income statement, i.e. in the Statement of comprehensive income or directly in Equity in the Statement of financial position . Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset, if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current income tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority. Since 1 January 2009 and in accordance with IAS27 (revised), when a sold option or a firm commitment on minorities is exercised, the amount in Other payables is reversed against Cash, and the remaining balances of non controlling interest s and Equity derivatives are reversed against Equity. _Financial liabilities_ A financial liability is derecognized when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expired.

Derivative hedging instruments,1157.51.1,,"Lecta Group uses derivative instruments to hedge foreign currency, interest rate and energy price fluctuations. Such derivative instruments are stated at their fair values as communicated by the financial institutions and the energy companies that are the counterparties to these transactions. For accounting purposes, derivative instruments are classified in the three following categories: – _Fair value hedges: to cover the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability. In Lecta Group, these are forward agreements on realized day-to-day sales and purchases in non-euro currencies. Any gain or loss from re-measuring the hedging instrument at fair value is recognized in the line ‘‘Other operating costs except non recurring items ’’ of the Income statement against ‘‘Trade receivables’’ or ‘‘Trade payables’’. – _Cash flow hedges: to cover the exposure to variability in cash flows that is attributable to a particular risk associated with a forecast transaction. In Lecta Group, these could be the interest rate, exchange rate and energy price swaps, caps, floors, collars, options. The portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognized directly in the line ‘‘Net incomes (expenses) recognized directly through Equity’’ of the Statement of financial position against ‘‘Other receivables’’ or ‘‘Other payables’’. It is removed from Equity when the hedged item affects the Income statement. The ineffective portion of gain or loss is immediately recognized in the line ‘‘Non recurring items ’’ of the Income statement. – _Hedges of net investments in foreign entities denominated in a non-euro currency: In Lecta Group, there is no such instrument.

Where the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from an asset and has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset nor transferred control of the asset, the asset is recognized to the extent of the Group’s continuing involvement in the asset. Continuing involvement that takes the form of a guarantee over the transferred asset is measured at the lower of the original carrying amount of the asset and the maximum amount of consideration that the Group could be required to repay. Where continuing involvement takes the form of a written and / or purchased option (including a cash settled option or similar provision) on the transferred asset, the extent of the Group’s continuing involvement is the amount of the transferred asset that the Group may repurchase, except that in the case of a written put option (including a cash settled option or similar provision) on an asset measured at fair value, the extent of the Group’s continuing involvement is limited to the lower of the fair value of the transferred asset and the option exercise price.

These are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014. These amendments are not expected to be relevant to the Group. – Amendments to IAS 36 — Recoverable amount disclosure for non financial assets The amendments clarify the disclosure requirements in respect of fair value less costs of disposal. When IAS 36 Impairment of Assets was originally changed as a consequence of IFRS 13, the IASB intended to require disclosure of information about the recoverable amount of impaired assets if that amount was based on fair value less costs to sell. An unintended consequence of the amendments was that an entity would be required to disclose the recoverable amount for each cash-generating unit for which the carrying amount of goodwill or intangible assets with indefinite useful lives allocated to that unit was significant in comparison with the entity’s total carrying amount of goodwill or intangible assets with indefinite useful lives. This requirement has been deleted by the amendment. These are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014. – Amendments to IAS 39 — Novation of Derivatives and Continuation of Hedge accounting These amendments provide relief from discontinuing hedge accounting when novation of a derivative designated as a hedging instrument meets certain criteria. These amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014.
