16,Final Offerings 2020.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.1,"Risks Relating to the Group’s Business, Technology and Competition",1.1.1,The Group faces significant competition in each of the industries in which the Group operates and competitive pressures could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business.,"The French telecommunications market is a mature market, marked by very active competition between the main operators and very strong pressure on prices. Despite growth in market size, the French telecommunications market has recently declined in value primarily due to price pressure in the mobile market following the arrival of a fourth player in 2012 and the decline in regulated call termination rates. The Group faces significant competition from established and more recent competitors and may face competition from new entrants and market concentrations in the future. While the nature and level of competition to which the Group is subject vary according to the products and services that it offers, in each case the Group generally competes on the basis of prices, marketing, products, network coverage, characteristics of services, and customer service. The main competitor of the Group in the residential and business services markets overall is Orange, the incumbent telecommunications operator in France, that has greater financial resources and owns a more extensive network than the Group’s and that is unlikely to be duplicated or matched by the Group in the near future. Bouygues Telecom Enterprises (“Bouygues Telecom”) and Iliad are the Group’s major competitors in the residential market. In the premium pay-TV market, Groupe Canal+ products are available throughout the French territory via satellite, cable, and DTT and DSL technologies. The Group’s main competitor in business services markets overall is Orange, the incumbent telecommunications operator in France. Orange has greater financial resources and owns a more extensive network than the Group which the Group is unlikely to duplicate or match in the near future. In the residential market, in addition to Orange and Bouygues Telecom, the Group also competes with international telecommunications operators such as Colt, Verizon, AT&T, and BT, which offer multinationals access to their international networks while the Group’s network is available only in France. The Group also has operations in the French Overseas Territories that face competition and competitive pressure risks similar to those described herein. The Group’s products and services are also subject to increasing competition from alternative new technologies or improvements in existing technologies. New players from sectors that are either unregulated or subject to different regulations (including internet players such as Yahoo!, Google, Disney+, Microsoft, Amazon, Apple, YouTube, Netflix and other audiovisual players, media players and “over the top” (“OTT”) (of an existing broadband internet network) players) have also emerged as competitors to the Group’s video content offering. These players are taking advantage of improved connectivity and platform agnostic technologies to offer OTT and cloud-based services. Telecommunications operators are expected to maintain traditional access services and billing relationships over which users access services from adjacent players such as well-known companies offering music, video, photos, apps and retail. The rapid success of audiovisual content streamed through the telecommunications network and insufficient innovation could lead to the emergence of other content or service providers as well as the saturation of the market, which would put pressure on the revenues and margins of operators like the Group, while simultaneously requiring them to increase capital expenditures to remain competitive, which could adversely affect the Group’s business, financial condition or results of operations. ----- Moreover, the Group is also facing competition from non-traditional mobile voice and data services based on new mobile internet technologies, in particular OTT applications, such as Skype, Google Talk, Facetime, Viber and WhatsApp. These OTT applications are often free of charge, accessible via smartphones and allow their users to have access to potentially unlimited messaging and voice services over the internet, thus bypassing more expensive traditional voice and messaging services, such as SMS and MMS, provided by mobile network operators, who are only able to charge the internet data usage for such services. All telecommunications operators are currently competing with OTT service providers who leverage existing infrastructures and operate capitallight business models, enhancing their ability to compete with businesses, such as the Group’s, which operate capital-intensive business models. OTT service providers have over the past years become more sophisticated and technological developments have led to a significant improvement in the quality of service, particularly in speech quality. In addition, players with strong brand capability and financial strength, such as Apple, Google and Microsoft, have turned their attention to the provision of OTT audio and data services. In the long term, if nontraditional mobile voice and data services or similar services continue to increase in popularity and if the Group, or more generally all of the telecommunications operators, are not able to address this competition, this could cause declines in subscriber base and profitability across all of the Group’s products and services, among other material adverse effects. In addition, the Group may face increasing competition from the large-scale roll-out of public Wifi networks by local governments and utilities and transportation service providers, new and existing Wifi telecommunications operators and others, which particularly benefits OTT service providers. Due to their ability to leverage existing infrastructure and to roll out public Wifi in a cost-efficient way, the Group’s competitors may be better positioned to offer their customers public Wifi access at attractive terms and conditions or as part of their current mobile and landline offerings, which may affect the Group’s ability to retain or acquire customers. Furthermore, the Group’s competitors may realize cost savings by off-loading mobile data traffic onto their own Wifi networks or those of their partners in order to reduce costs and increase bandwidth more quickly or efficiently than the Group can. An increase in public Wifi networks could also cause declines in profitability as demand for the Group’s network and services decreases. The following is an overview of the competitive landscape in France: _1. Residential—Mobile_ The Group competes with service providers that use alternative technologies for internet access, such as satellite technologies or mobile standards such as universal mobile telecommunications system (“UMTS”) and 3G/4G mobile technologies. These mobile broadband high speed internet access technologies may enable both incumbent and new broadband access providers to provide high bandwidth connection services for voice and data. Furthermore, additional access technologies may be launched in the future that will further increase competition or lead the Group to increase capital expenditure for additional upgrades. Providers of mobile broadband internet access may be able to offer fast internet access speeds at a competitive cost, with the additional possibility of allowing subscribers to access the internet remotely. The French mobile telephony market is characterized by competition among well-established mobile network operators such as Orange, Bouygues Telecom and Free and other operators without their own mobile networks. Competition has intensified, particularly as to price, since Free entered the market in early 2012 with a low-priced unlimited calling package. The mobile telephony market in France is currently undergoing a transformation because of competitive pricing, bundled packages no longer including subsidized handsets and the development of “low cost” brands. After strong price decreases in 2013 and 2014, which resulted in mobile post-paid prices in France being among the lowest in Europe, price pressure eased in 2015 and 2016 but intensified again in 2017, weakened slightly in 2018, increased again in 2019, and remained stable in 2020. If price pressure continues to intensify, the Group’s results of operations and financial condition in future periods may be materially adversely affected. _2. Residential—Fixed_ In the French pay-TV market, the Group competes with providers of premium television packages such as CanalSat, DSL triple-play and/or quadruple-play operators such as Orange, Free and Bouygues Telecom, which provide IPTV, and providers of pay DTT (such as Canal+, which operates across multiple formats: including IPTV, pay DTT, satellite and cable). The growth of IPTV, which is the most popular pay-TV distribution platform followed by satellite and DTT, has changed the market, opening up the provision of pay-TV services beyond the ----- traditional methods of cable and satellite, which is limited by the inability to install a satellite dish on the façade of buildings in certain areas, such as central Paris. The Group also competes with satellite television services that may be able to offer a greater range of channels to a larger audience, reaching wider geographic areas (especially in rural areas) for lower prices than the prices of the Group’s cable pay-TV services. Any increase in market share of satellite distribution may have a negative impact on the success of the Group’s digital cable television services. The Group also faces competition from satellite distribution of free to air television programming. While pay DTT’s share of the pay-TV market is currently low, providers of pay DTT may in the future be able to offer a wider range of channels to a larger audience for lower prices than the Group charges. In the broadband market, the Group provides high speed internet through its cable, FTTH and xDSL networks and it competes primarily with xDSL and FTTH providers, with FTTH currently being the most widespread technology used to access very high speed internet in France. Orange is the leading DSL provider in France, followed by Free, the Group and Bouygues Telecom. While the Group believes that it has the network advantage in terms of its fiber optic/cable network compared to its competitors’ xDSL networks, and better coverage of fiber networks as compared to its competitors, which currently places the Group at a competitive advantage to exploit the increased demand in France for very-high-speed internet in the areas covered by the Group’s fiber optic/cable network, such competitive advantage may be diminished to the extent that competitors increase the roll out their FTTH networks. For further information see “The deployment of fiber optic networks and/or VDSL2 by _competitors of the Group could reduce and ultimately eliminate the gap between the speed and the power of the fiber optic/cable network of the Group compared to the DSL networks of its main competitors.” In addition, the_ Group’s xDSL competitors’ networks cover more French households than the Group’s network and pricing is very competitive. _3. Business Services—B2B_ In the B2B segment the Group’s main competitors are Orange (Orange Business Services) and Colt. Bouygues Telecom is also a competitor in the SME segment. The French B2B market for voice services is extremely price sensitive, with sophisticated customers, relatively short term (typically one year) contracts, and vulnerability to cuts in mobile termination rates. The ability to compete effectively is partially a function of network capillarity, and certain of the Group’s competitors have a more extensive and denser network than us. In the data market, customers also often seek combined infrastructure and software solutions. As a result, the Group also competes with software and other IT providers of data and network solutions, which may decrease the value customers place on its infrastructure solutions, leading to a reduction in its prices and margins. IT providers may also partner with the Group’s infrastructure telecommunications competitors. _4. Business Services—Wholesale_ The French wholesale telecommunications market is dominated by Orange and the Group, although Orange’s and the Group’s market shares vary depending on the segment. The Group also faces competition from consortiums of telecommunications operators and construction companies, such as Covage, Vinci, Eiffage and Axiom (who may lay down fiber in construction sites and then lease them on the wholesale market). The wholesale market for data services in France is less volatile than the voice market. Competition is based primarily, in addition to price, on service quality and technological advancement. The wholesale market for dark fiber infrastructure in France is more open than for wholesale voice and data carriage, as providing it does not require having a dense, national network and does not include any services would require technical expertise. The Group expects competition in the French telecommunications industry to remain intense and there can be no assurance that the Group will not be negatively impacted by any future consolidation of the Group’s competitors or similar developments in one or more of the markets in which the Group competes.

16,Final Offerings 2020.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.1,"Risks Relating to the Group’s Business, Technology and Competition",1.1.2,The deployment of fiber optic networks and/or VDSL2 by competitors of the Group could reduce and ultimately eliminate the gap between the speed and the power of the fiber optic/cable network of the Group compared to the DSL networks of its main competitors.,"The Group believes that one of its major competitive advantages is the power and speed of its fiber optic/cable network. As of June 30, 2020, the Group’s network passed approximately 17,457,000 fiber/cable homes, including fiber/cable homes now passed by SFR FTTH. However, competitors of the Group are also deploying fiber and/or VDSL2 networks enabling download speeds and bandwidths that could rival those reached by the Group’s network, and thus strongly reduce the Group’s competitive advantage. The Group’s main competitors (Orange, ----- Free and Bouygues Telecom) have begun to introduce FTTH networks to increase and harmonize their network speed. On December 4, 2019, Orange unveiled its strategic plan through 2025 indicating its objectives for FTTH lines to include the deployment of approximately 19 million lines in private areas (compared to 10.4 million already rolled-out as of June 2019) and approximately 4 million lines in investment areas (compared to 0.4 million as of June 2019) in addition of approximately 13 million lines deployed by a third party and co-financed by Orange by 2023 (Source: _Orange press release). Furthermore, other operators may obtain access to the infrastructure deployed by an operator, through joint projects for financing. All of the DSL operators have announced various agreements on sharing the deployment of FTTH in given areas. For example, Orange and Free entered into a contract in July 2013 providing for the deployment by Free of a fiber network using Orange’s infrastructure in approximately 20 French cities, which allows for open access to all competing operators. In addition, in 2013 the French government announced a FTTH deployment plan of €20 billion (invested by private operators and local authorities) with the objective of providing very-high-speed internet access to the entire territory in 2022. The government will provide a subsidy package of approximately €3,300 million, partly from funding from the Investments for the Future Program managed by the Office of the General Commissioner of Investment under the 2015 Budget Act. The rollout has been divided in three zones: very dense areas (approximately six million households) and low-density areas (approximately 13 million households), that are already covered or will be covered by FTTH with privately-funded networks; and low-density areas (approximately 15 million households), where private operators will co-invest with public partners. Orange and the Group will lead the deployment of the very-high speed network in privately-funded, low density areas, with the Group being in charge of approximately 20% of the network deployment. Various local and regional authorities have already extended subsidies to network operators, including the Group, to install FTTH connections. This trend should continue, as certain departments, municipalities and regions, such as Hauts-deSeine, Amiens and Louvin, for example, have entered into public-private partnerships to encourage such investments. In such areas, various operators will have access to the network and will be able to compete. In addition, in accordance with the conditions established by ARCEP, third-party operators may have access to the infrastructure used by an operator, including by co-financing projects, for their own very-high-speed internet offers. As a result, FTTH deployment by the Group’s competitors could accelerate and the share of FTTH on the highspeed internet market could grow significantly, thereby eliminating or reducing the Group’s fixed network advantage. VDSL2 technology has also been implemented in some areas by competitors of the Group. Deployment of VDSL2 only requires adding VDSL2 cards in already deployed digital subscriber line access multiplexers (“DSLAMs”) and does not involve physical intervention at the subscriber’s premises. Moreover, the deployment of this technology has accelerated since October 2014 given the favorable opinion of the copper experts committee that has allowed the marketing, starting from that date, of VDSL2 in indirect distribution on all lines from a main distribution frame (“MDF”) on Orange’s local copper loop. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 5,950,000 households were eligible for VDSL2 (source: ARCEP). If the competitors of the Group continue to deploy or significantly increase their fiber optic networks they could be able to compete with the Group in terms of the offering of high-speed internet and television services of a quality and speed greater than or equal to those of the Group, thus potentially eliminating the Group’s current competitive advantage, increasing the pressure upon prices and margins and leading the Group to make significant investments in order to match the services they offer. Deployment of VDSL2 and/or fiber optic networks by competitors also represents a risk for the business services activity of the Group, particularly with regard to medium-sized, small-to-medium-sized and very-small-sized businesses to which the Group’s DSL and fiber/cable networks network presently represent an advantage. Although the Group is preparing for this deployment by improving its product range and building out its fiber/cable network, such deployment could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial position and results of operations.",Parsing Error,Parsing Error,Parsing Error,
16,Final Offerings 2020.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.1,"Risks Relating to the Group’s Business, Technology and Competition",1.1.3,"Changes in competitive offerings for content, including the potential rapid adoption of piracy-based video offerings, could adversely impact the Group’s business.","The market for content is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change. Through new and existing distribution channels, consumers have increasing options to access entertainment video, sports and other content. The various economic models underlying these channels include subscription, transactional, ad-supported and piracy-based models. All of these have the potential to capture meaningful segments of the content market. Piracy, in particular, threatens to damage the Group’s business, as its fundamental proposition of virtually all content being offered for ----- free to consumers is so compelling and difficult to compete against. Furthermore, in light of the compelling consumer proposition, piracy services are subject to rapid global growth. Traditional providers of content, including broadcasters, as well as internet based e-commerce or content providers are increasing their internetbased offerings. Several of these competitors have long operating histories, large customer bases, strong brand recognition and significant financial, marketing and other resources. They may secure better terms from suppliers, adopt more aggressive pricing and devote more resources to product development, technology, infrastructure, content acquisitions and marketing. New entrants may enter the market, or existing providers may adjust their services, with unique offerings or approaches to providing content. Companies also may enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive positions. If the Group is unable to successfully or profitably compete with current and new competitors, the Group’s business will be adversely affected, and it may not be able to increase or maintain market share, revenues or profitability.",Parsing Error,Parsing Error,Parsing Error,
16,Final Offerings 2020.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.1,"Risks Relating to the Group’s Business, Technology and Competition",1.1.4,"Acquisitions and other strategic transactions present many risks, including the risk that the Group may not be able to integrate newly acquired operations into its business, which may prevent the Group from realizing the strategic and financial goals contemplated at the time of any such transaction and thus adversely affect the its business.","Historically, the Group’s business has grown, in part, through a significant number of selective acquisitions, including the SFR Acquisition that has enabled the Group to take advantage of existing networks, service offerings and management expertise. The Group may continue to grow its business through acquisitions of broadband and mobile communications businesses, content companies and ancillary services that we believe will present opportunities to create value by generating strong cash flows and operational synergies. In addition, we have recently entered into certain strategic transactions, such as the Towers Transactions and the sale of the Group’s Voice Carrier Business, to monetize the value of certain of our non-core assets in France, and the sale of a 49.99% interest in SFR FTTH to create an alternative FTTH infrastructure wholesale operator. Moreover, SFR FTTH (an associate of the Group) has entered into agreement to acquire all of the equity interests in Covage, which transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2020. In the future, the Group may enter into similar transactions. Any acquisition, disposal or other strategic transaction the Group may undertake in the future could result in the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities and an increase in interest expenses, amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets or in the use by us of available cash on hand to finance any such acquisitions. The Group may experience difficulties in integrating acquired operations into the Group’s business, incur higher than expected costs or fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits or synergies of these acquisitions, if any. Such transactions may also disrupt the Group’s relationships with current and new employees, customers and suppliers. In addition, the Group’s management may be distracted by such acquisitions and the integration of acquired businesses. Thus, if the Group consummates any further acquisitions or fail to integrate any previous acquisitions, there could be a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in completing business acquisitions or integrating previously acquired companies. In addition, the Group’s debt burden may increase if we borrow funds to finance any future transactions, which could have a negative impact on the Group’s cash flows and the Group’s ability to finance our overall operations. Acquisitions or disposals of additional telecommunications companies may require the approval of governmental authorities (either domestically or, in the case of the EU, at the EU level), which can block, impose conditions on, or delay the process which could result in a failure on our part to proceed with announced transactions on a timely basis or at all, thus hampering our opportunities for growth. In the event conditions are imposed and we fail to meet them in a timely manner, the relevant governmental authority may impose fines and, if in connection with a merger transaction, may require restorative measures, such as mandatory disposition of assets or divestiture of operations. Although we analyze and conduct due diligence on acquisition targets, our assessments are subject to a number of assumptions concerning profitability, growth, interest rates and company valuations and our inquiries may fail to uncover relevant information. There can be no assurance that our assessments or due diligence of and assumptions regarding acquisition targets will prove to be correct, and actual developments may differ significantly from our expectations. Moreover, our plans to acquire additional businesses in the future are subject to the availability of suitable opportunities. The Group’s competitors may also follow similar acquisition strategies and may have greater financial resources available for investments or may be willing to accept less favorable terms than we can accept, which may prevent us from acquiring businesses that we target to the benefit of our competitors. ----- The operating complexity of the Group’s business and the responsibilities of management have increased significantly as a result of the growth of our business through acquisitions, which may place significant strain on our managerial and operational resources. The Group may be unable to allocate sufficient managerial and operational resources to meet our needs as our business grows, and our current operational and financial systems and managerial controls and procedures may become inadequate. Although the Group considers the operational and financial systems and managerial controls and procedures that we currently have in place to be adequate for the Group’s purposes, we recognize that the effectiveness of these systems, controls and procedures needs to be kept under regular review as the Group’s business grows. The Group will have to maintain close coordination among our logistical, technical, accounting, finance, marketing and sales personnel. Management of growth will also require, among other things, continued development of financial and management controls and information technology systems. The constant growth may strain our managerial resources which may require the Group to hire additional managerial resources. The Group may be unable to hire managers with the relevant expertise or the hiring process may require significant time and resources, all of which could result in a disruption in the Group’s management, growth, operational and financial systems, managerial controls and procedures and, accordingly, the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations. The Group periodically evaluates, and has engaged in, the disposition of certain non-core assets and businesses. Divestitures could involve difficulties in the separation of operations, services, products and personnel, the diversion of management’s attention, the disruption of our business and the potential loss of key employees. After reaching an agreement with a buyer for the disposition of a business, the transaction may be subject to the satisfaction of pre-closing conditions as well as to obtaining necessary regulatory and government approvals, which, if not satisfied or obtained, may prevent us from completing the transaction. Divestitures may also involve continued financial involvement in the divested assets and businesses, such as indemnities or other financial obligations, in which the performance of the divested assets or businesses could impact our results of operations. Any divestiture the Group undertakes could adversely affect the Group’s financial condition and results of operations. In certain cases, the Group has entered into or may enter into joint venture arrangements with a majority or minority interest in such joint ventures. Even in cases where the Group has retained a majority interest, the joint venture partner may have significant influence over policies, including consent rights with respect to certain specified matters. The Group has a lesser degree of control over the business operations of the joint ventures and businesses in which it has made minority investments.",Parsing Error,Parsing Error,Parsing Error,
16,Final Offerings 2020.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.1,"Risks Relating to the Group’s Business, Technology and Competition",1.1.5,The Group might not be able to effectively implement or adapt its business strategy.,"The Group has based its strategy on its vision of the market, especially the importance of very-high-speed fiber/cable and mobile networks and of fixed-mobile convergence. At the core of the Group’s strategy has been revenue, profitability and cash flow growth. Key elements of this strategy have included: (i) operational and financial turnaround under the leadership of a new management team; (ii) optimizing commercial performance with a particular focus on customer services; (iii) continuing to invest in best-in-class infrastructure commensurate with its market position; and (iv) monetizing content investments through various pay-TV models and growing advertising revenue. However, the Group is evolving in a market affected by economic, competitive and regulatory uncertainty and the Group must regularly adapt its business model to take into account market changes such as changes in consumer behavior, introduction of new technology, products or services, competition and the development of specific pricing policies, the adaptation of its structural costs, the streamlining of its operational organization, and the adaptation of its sales strategy. If the measures taken by the Group do not meet the demands, expectations, or habits of the consumer, it will have an adverse effect on the return on investments, financial targets, market share, and revenues generated. Consequently, any development of the Group’s business strategy that proves not to be sufficiently adapted to the actual trends and demands, expectations, or habits of the consumer in the telecommunications market may not achieve its desired goals and/or have a material adverse effect on its business, financial position and results of operations. Moreover, the transformation of the Group following the execution of certain strategic transactions, including non-core asset disposals, strategic acquisitions and investments or entry into joint venture arrangements, could create operational difficulties and unforeseen expenses and could give rise to significant administrative, financial, and managerial challenges involving the activity of the Group. Such strategic transactions may also disrupt its ongoing business, cause management’s attention to be diverted and result in legal, regulatory, contractual, labor, or other difficulties that have not been foreseen or disclosed. -----",Parsing Error,Parsing Error,Parsing Error,

While the Group’s total revenues increased for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31 2018, there was a decrease in revenues in the residential-fixed and media segments. Similarly, while the Group’s total revenue increased for the six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2019, there was a decrease in revenues in the equipment sales and media segments. The Group’s Adjusted EBITDA remained flat for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 and for the six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to June 30, 2019, but increased for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. While the Group is focused on achieving an operational financial turnaround, there can be no assurance that this trend of declines in revenue will not continue in future periods. The Group expects its DSL business with Bouygues Telecom to continue to decline. In particular, churn in Bouygues Telecom’s DSL white label customers has already led to a decrease in white label subscribers. If the revenue and profitability loss from such businesses is not offset by revenue and profitability growth in other Group businesses, this could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business activities, the results of its operation and financial condition. In addition, the Group could experience further decreases in customers on its DSL network in the future due to their migration to fiber/cable networks providing them with access to greater internet speeds compared with those available on DSL networks.

Customer churn is a measure of the number of customers who stop subscribing for one or more of our products or services. Churn arises mainly as a result of the contractual subscription period (generally 12 months in the residential segments and between one and three years in the business services market), competitive influences, the relocation of clients outside of the Group’s network area (which is less extensive than our competitors), introduction of new products and technologies, deterioration of personal financial circumstances, price increases and regulatory developments. Customer churn may also increase if the Group is unable to deliver satisfactory services over its network, or if it modifies the types of services it makes available in a certain region. In addition, customer churn also arises upon the cancellation of services to customers who are delinquent in their payments to the Group. In addition, the Group outsources many of its customer service functions to third party contractors over which the Group has less control than if it were performing those tasks itself. The Group has experienced significant churn in mobile and fixed customers in recent years due to intense competition. Moreover, the churn rate in the Group’s white label business may increase for reasons outside the Group’s control (as it is not involved in client services and retention). In particular, churn in Bouygues Telecom’s DSL white label customers has already led to a decrease in white label subscribers, which is expected to continue in the long term. See “Business of the Group—Material Contracts—White Label Agreements”. If the Group fails to effectively communicate the benefits of the Group’s networks through its marketing advertising efforts, it may not be able to attract new customers and our efforts to attract and retain customers may prove unsuccessful. In addition, any interruption of the Group’s services or the removal or unavailability of programming, which may not be under our control, could contribute to increased customer churn. Further the Group’s competitors may improve their ability to attract new customers, for example by offering new product bundles or product offerings at lower prices than the Group, which would make it difficult for the Group to retain its current subscribers, and the cost of retaining and acquiring new subscribers could increase. In addition, the Group’s business services operations are also subject to tariff churn (i.e. an existing customer negotiating tariff decreases). Large corporate customers in particular are highly sophisticated and often aggressive in seeking to renegotiate the pricing of their contracts, which tends to result in margin pressure. Increased customer or tariff churn may have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations. -----",Parsing Error,Parsing Error,Parsing Error,

The Group’s long term results of operations therefore depend substantially upon its ability to continue to conceive, design, source and market new products and services as well as continuing market acceptance of the Group’s existing and future products and services. Should the Group fail to or be significantly delayed in introducing new products and services in the future, if the Group’s new products and services are not accepted by customers, or if the Group’s competitors introduce more sophisticated or more popular products and services, the Group’s business and results of operations may be adversely affected.",Parsing Error,Parsing Error,Parsing Error,

For example, the ability to provide movies, sports and other popular programming, including videoon-demand (“VOD”) content, is a major factor that attracts subscribers to pay-TV services, especially premium services. The Group relies on digital programming suppliers for a significant portion of the Group’s programming content and VOD services. The Group may not be able to obtain sufficient high quality programming, sports and other content from third party producers for the Group’s digital cable television and other services on satisfactory terms or at all in order to offer compelling digital cable television services. The Group also relies on certain of its competitors for the provision of certain content offerings. In addition, to the extent that the Group is unable to reach agreements with certain content providers on terms that the Group believes is reasonable, the Group may be forced, or may determine for strategic or business reasons, to remove such content from its line-up and may decide to replace it with other programming, which may not be available on acceptable terms or be as attractive to customers. There can be no assurance that the Group’s expiring programming and other content contracts will be renewed on favorable or comparable terms or at all, or that the rights the Group negotiates will be adequate for it to execute the Group’s business strategy. The inability to obtain high quality content, may also limit the Group’s ability to migrate customers from lower tier programming to higher tier products, thereby inhibiting the Group’s ability to execute its business strategy. Any or all of these factors could result in reduced demand for, and lower revenue and profitability from, the Group’s digital cable television and other content services. Programming and content-related costs are one of the Group’s largest categories of expenses. In recent years, the cost of programming in the cable and satellite video industries has increased significantly and is expected to continue to increase, particularly with respect to costs for sports programming and broadcast networks. The Group may not be able to pass these increased programming costs on to the Group’s subscribers due to the increasingly competitive environment that the Group operates in. If the Group is unable to pass these increased programming costs on to its subscribers, its business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. Moreover, programming costs typically include a minimum guaranteed amount and a variable amount related directly to the number of subscribers to whom the programming is provided, which may affect the Group’s ability to negotiate lower per-subscriber programming costs and which could impact the Group’s operating margins. The expiration dates of the Group’s various programming contracts are staggered, which results in the expiration of a portion of its programming contracts throughout each year. The Group may not be able to renegotiate these agreements on terms as favorable as those of the current agreements, or at all, which could result in a decline in the revenue generated or an increase in the Group’s costs deriving from broadcaster licences. The Group attempts to control its programming costs and, therefore, the cost of the video services it charges to its customers, by negotiating favorable terms for the renewal of its affiliation agreements with programmers. To the ----- extent the Group is unable to reach agreements with certain programmers on terms it believes are reasonable, the Group may be forced to, or determine for strategic reasons to, remove certain programming from its line-up and may decide to replace such programming with alternatives which may not be as attractive to consumers or available on acceptable terms. Such negotiations have in the past and may in the future affect the Group’s carriage of particular programming services. Some of the Group’s programming contracts require it to pay prices for the programming based on a guaranteed minimum number of subscribers, even if that number is larger than the number of actual subscribers, whereas some of the Group’s programming contracts are based on a flat fee irrespective of the popularity of the content purchased under such contract. As a result, if the Group misjudges anticipated demand for the programming or if the programming it acquires does not attract the number of viewers anticipated, the profitability of the Group’s television services may be impaired. Furthermore, as the Group purchases a significant portion of its content from various content providers under relatively short term contracts, the prices the Group pays to purchase such content is subject to change and may increase significantly in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s results of operations. Furthermore, program providers and broadcasters may elect to distribute their programming through other distribution platforms, such as satellite platforms, digital terrestrial broadcasting or IPTV, or may enter into exclusive arrangements with other distributors. Such actions may inconvenience some of the Group’s subscribers and can lead to customer dissatisfaction and, in certain cases, the loss of customers, which may have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, as long as the Group continues to develop its VOD and other interactive services, its ability to acquire programs for its free VOD offerings (replay), VOD by subscription, and one-time VOD will become more and more crucial and will depend on the ability of the Group to maintain a relationship and cooperation with content providers and broadcasters, for both standard-definition as well as HD content. If the Group cannot obtain and keep competitive programs at attractive prices on its networks, demand for its services could decline, thus limiting its ability to maintain or increase the revenue. A loss of programs or an inability to ensure the availability of premium content under favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on the business activities of the Group, its financial position and its results of operations.",Parsing Error,Parsing Error,Parsing Error,

In particular, the Group incurs significant capital expenses for the deployment of new technologies such as 4G and 5G (for the purchase of frequencies and the deployment of network infrastructures) for its mobile operations and fiber optics (for the deployment of the fiber infrastructure) and for its fixed operations. Moreover, as spectrum auctions are infrequent and the Group may need additional spectrum in the future, the Group will likely participate in future spectrum auctions even though it might not, at the time of auction, require additional spectrum capacity. Such participation would require significant capital expenditures in the near term as acquiring spectrum is expensive, due in part to the fact that spectrum availability is limited. Furthermore, new technologies and the use of multiple applications increasing customers’ bandwidth requirements could lead to saturation of the networks and require telecommunications operators to make additional investments to increase the capacity of their infrastructures. Moreover, the Group regularly invests in the content that we offer in order to provide our subscribers with a flexible and diverse range of programming and other content options, including high-quality local content and exclusive premium content, in order to reduce churn. For example, the structure of the French telecommunications market does not allow telecommunications operators to pass along their investment costs to the end consumer in proportion to the volume of data consumed. Accordingly, telecommunications operators may not benefit from increased revenues from the growing demand for data and content even though they incur the costs of such demand through their investments in infrastructure. The Group is also bound by certain obligations of access and/or coverage for its fiber/cable and/or mobile network, particularly under its mobile licences, such as obligations to allow roaming or sharing of networks in certain deployment zones. This requires the Group to make significant and frequent investments and the conditions for ----- the implementation of these obligations, including some prices (such as roaming rates), may be regulated within the EU. Given such constraints, the Group may not be able to operate its network under economically favorable conditions, which could affect the profitability of its investments. The Group may be subject to similar obligations in the future, which could have a material effect on the manner in which the Group operates its business and, accordingly, on its outlook, financial position or results of operations. It cannot be guaranteed that the Group will continue to have sufficient resources to maintain the quality of its network and of its other products and services, and to expand the Group’s network coverage, which are key elements for its growth of over the long term.

More specifically, the unavailability or failure of information systems used by the Group, the Group’s network, the production of “electronic” communications services and television, the Group’s website, and the customer service function of the Group, could significantly disrupt the Group’s business. A flood, fire, other natural disaster, war, act of terrorism, power failure, cyber-attack, computer virus or other catastrophe affecting a portion of the Group’s network could have a material adverse impact on its business and its relations with customers. For example, the Group’s business in the French Overseas Territories has experienced network disruptions and other adverse effects in the past, and may experience network disruption and other adverse effects in the future, as a result of extreme weather and other environmental conditions. Measures with the aim of remedying such disasters, safety and security measures, or measures for protecting service continuity that have been undertaken or may be undertaken in the future by the Group, as well as the effects thereof on the performance of its network, could be insufficient to avoid losses. The Group is insured against operating losses only up to a capped amount, any disaster or other damage affecting the network of the Group could result in significant uninsured losses. The Group’s network may be subjected to disruptions and to significant technological problems, and such difficulties could escalate over time. For example, although the Group’s cable networks are generally built in resilient rings to ensure the continuity of network availability in the event of any damage to its underground fibers, if any ring is cut twice in different locations, transmission signals will not be able to pass through, which could cause significant damage to the Group’s business. In the event of a power outage or other shortage, we do not have a back up or alternative supply source for all of the Group’s network components. The occurrence of any such event could cause interruptions in service or reduce capacity for customers, either of which could reduce the Group’s revenue or cause the Group to incur additional expenses. In addition, the occurrence of any such event may subject us to penalties and other sanctions imposed by regulators. Further, the Group may incur costs and revenue losses associated with the unauthorized use of the Group’s networks, including administrative and capital costs associated with the unpaid use of the Group’s networks as well as with detecting, monitoring and reducing the incidences of fraud. Fraud also impacts interconnection costs, capacity costs, administrative costs and payments to other carriers for unbillable fraudulent roaming charges. In addition, the Group’s business depends on certain crucial systems, particularly its network operations center and its billing and customer service systems. In particular, the support for a large number of systems critical to the network of the Group is located at a relatively limited number of sites. While the Group has extensive backup systems, the risk that these systems may not be sufficient to handle a spike in activity cannot be ruled out, which could lead to a slowdown or unavailability of IT systems for a period of time and, when involving the business ----- services customers of the Group, to financial penalties. Moreover, the Group may incur legal penalties and reputational damages to the extent that any accident or security breach results in a loss of or damage to customers’ data or applications or the inappropriate disclosure of confidential information. Moreover, the technical projects of the Group that are in progress, involving both information systems and networks, and the plans for migrations planned in the short and medium terms for certain pieces of mobile network equipment, may generate an increased risk of failures of networks and information systems. In particular, the quality of the networks could be impacted by the deployment of the 4G network as well as by the concurrent work of renovating 2G and 3G networks, requiring, among other things, frequent technical interventions. Such work could also result in breakdowns or interruptions in services for the customers of the Group. Furthermore, the development of the resources used by consumers (for example, videoconferencing, telepresence, and cloud computing for business services customers), of the “Internet of Things”, and of new terminals (smartphones, tablets, etc.) may generate risks of saturating the networks due to the large volumes of data that such resources generate or promote the use of. The end-of-year period is an extremely sensitive sales period. A major failure of the information systems or of any component of the chain of production and logistics during that period would have negative consequences on revenues. To reduce the likelihood of this type of risk occurring, the Group avoids changes to the network and information systems during this period of the year (starting in mid-November until the end of the year), however, there can be no assurance that there will be no failure of the Group’s network and information systems during the end-of-year period.

In certain cases, we have made substantial investments in the equipment or software of a particular supplier, making it difficult for the Group to quickly change supply and maintenance relationships in the event that our initial supplier refuses to offer favorable prices or ceases to produce equipment or provide the support that the Group requires. For example, while we continue to promote a rapid take up of our premium multi-play services using a single set-top box, the Group faces potential risks in securing the required customer set-top box equipment to maintain this roll out as the Group currently relies on a single provider. Currently, the Group has a sufficient supply of these boxes available, but any future shortages may involve significant delays in seeking alternative supplies, may constrain its ability to meet customer demand and may result in increased customer churn. Further, in the event that hardware or software products or related services are defective, it may be difficult or impossible to enforce recourse claims against suppliers, especially if warranties included in contracts with suppliers have expired or are exceeded by those in our contracts with the Group’s subscribers, in individual cases, or if the suppliers are insolvent, in whole or in part. In addition, there can be no assurances that the Group will be able to obtain the hardware, software and services it needs for the operation of the Group’s business in a timely manner, at competitive terms and in adequate amounts. In particular, in the case of an industry wide cyclical upturn or high demand for a particular product, the Group’s suppliers of software, hardware and other services may receive customer orders beyond the capacity of their operations, which could result in delivery delays, particularly where suppliers elect to prioritize other customer accounts. The Group has, from time to time, experienced extensions of lead times or limited supplies due to capacity constraints and other supply-related factors as well as quality control problems with service providers. The Group may also not be able to recover monies paid to such suppliers or obtain contractual damages to which the Group may be entitled (if any) in the event our suppliers fail to comply with their obligations in a timely manner. The Group also outsources some of its support services, including parts of its subscriber services, information technology support, technical services, and maintenance operations. Should any of these arrangements be terminated by either contract party, this could result in delays or disruptions to the Group’s operations and could result in it incurring additional costs, including if the outsourcing counterparty increases pricing or if the Group is required to locate alternative service providers or in-source previously outsourced services. ----- The Group is dependent on various third parties in order to provide commercially viable services. For example, the Group depends on Orange to access a portion of its network infrastructure and on Bouygues Telecom for access to certain mobile networks. The Group is generally dependent on access to sites and network infrastructure owned by third parties, including duct space and antennas used for our networks and facility space (colocation). In addition, the Group’s telephony services are reliant on its ability to interconnect with the telecommunications networks of other fixed-line, mobile and international operators globally. The Group has limited or no control over the quality and consistency of the services that are supplied to us by third parties. Any deterioration in the provision of such services may affect the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations. The Group’s ability to renew its existing contracts with suppliers of products or services or enter into new contractual relationships with these or other suppliers upon the expiration of existing agreements, either on commercially attractive terms, or at all, depends on a range of commercial and operational factors and events which may be beyond its control.

The introduction of new product offerings can initially place significant pressure on the Group’s customer service personnel. Increased pressure on such functions is generally associated with decreased satisfaction of customers. In the business services market, customers require service to be extremely reliable and to be re-established within short timeframes if there is any disruption. Penalties are often payable in the case of failure to meet expected service quality. In addition, product installation can be complex, requiring specialized knowledge and expensive equipment. Delays and service problems may result in both penalties and the potential loss of customers. In these segments, the Group relies on its experienced customer relations personnel to handle any customer issues or requests, and the loss of such personnel can result in the loss of customers. The Group has, in the past, experienced significant levels of customer dissatisfaction as a result of operational difficulties. Improvements to customer service functions may be necessary to achieve desired growth levels, and, if the Group fails to manage such improvements effectively and achieve such growth, the Group may in the future experience customer service problems and damage its reputation, contribute to increased churn and/or limit or slow the Group’s future growth.",Parsing Error,Parsing Error,Parsing Error,

Even though the Group requires its conditional access system providers to provide state of the art security for the conditional access systems, the security of the Group’s conditional access systems may be compromised by illegal piracy and other means. In addition, the Group’s set-top boxes require smart cards before subscribers can receive programming and its smart cards have been and may continue to be illegally duplicated, providing unlawful access to our television signals. While the Group works diligently to reduce the effect of piracy, there can be no assurance that the Group will be able to successfully eliminate the piracy it currently faces. In addition, there can be no assurance that any new conditional access system security that the Group may put in place will not be circumvented.

If any new or enhanced technologies, products or services that the Group introduces fail to achieve broad market acceptance or experience technical difficulties, the Group’s revenue growth, margins and cash flows may be ----- adversely affected. As a result, the Group may not recover investments that it makes in order to deploy these technologies and services. Enhanced fixed service infrastructure access and mobile services provided by competing operators may be more appealing to customers, and new technologies may enable the Group’s competitors to offer not only new services, but to also offer existing standard services at lower prices. The Group may not be able to fund the capital expenditures necessary to keep pace with technological developments. It is possible that alternative technologies that are more advanced than those the Group currently provides may be developed. The Group may not obtain the expected benefits of its investments if more advanced technology is adopted by the market. While the Group attempts to stay ahead of the market, closely following technological developments and making investments implementing such developments, it is difficult to forecast the effect that technical innovations will have on the Group’s business. The Group may also be unable to adapt to new or existing technologies to meet customer needs within an appropriate time frame, or a competitor may do so before us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Even if the Group adopts new technologies in a timely manner as they are developed, the cost of such technology may exceed their benefits. The Group’s inability to obtain the funding or other resources necessary to expand or further upgrade its systems and provide advanced services in a timely manner, or successfully anticipate the demands of the marketplace, could adversely affect the Group’s ability to attract and retain customers and generate revenue. Furthermore, given the pace of at which the Group launches new offers into the market and the multitude of its bundled service offerings, it may experience vulnerability to revenue leakage as a result of the dynamic changes in networks and IT systems. The Group’s revenue chain consists of a complex set of inter-related technologies and processes providing a seamless set of services to the end customer. Although the Group closely monitors the risks related to revenue loss and continuously improves controls in its revenue assurance processes in order to prevent and/or detect cases of revenue leakage, as the set of technologies and business processes grows bigger and more complex, the chance of failure increases in each connection of the revenue chain. Revenue leakage may have an impact on the Group’s ability to bill customers correctly for a given service or to receive the correct payment, which may adversely affect the Group’s margins and profitability. The Group anticipates that, over time, new products and services it may introduce will require upgraded or new customer premises equipment, which may constrain the Group’s ability to market and distribute such new products and services. For example, the Group does not expect that previously installed internet modems or set-top boxes will be able to support all the enhancements the Group may introduce to our broadband internet or pay-TV services over time. A portion of the Group’s subscribers will therefore require some form of upgrade or potentially a replacement of their customer premises equipment. Implementing such upgrades may entail additional costs to us and could delay the introduction of enhanced services and therefore reduce our cash flow and profitability, particularly where customers rent such customer premise equipment from us. In addition, we will need to expend significant capital expenditure to fulfil universal service obligations and to upgrade the parts of our networks that are xDSL. In particular, the Group must also continue to increase and improve the functionality, availability, and characteristics of its network, particularly by improving its bandwidth capacity and its 4G coverage, as well as the introduction of 5G technology, to meet the growing demand for the services that require very-high-speed telephony and internet services as the telecommunications industry in each of the markets in which the Group operates is facing challenges relating to: (i) rapid, significant technological evolution; (ii) frequent improvement of existing products or services resulting from the emergence of new technologies; and (iii) the establishment of new industry practices and standards that make current systems and technologies obsolete. There can be no assurance that we will have sufficient capital to finance such upgrades or that such upgrades will generate a positive return. The Group may also be required to incur additional marketing and customer service costs in order to retain and attract existing customers to any upgraded products and services we offer, as well as to respond to competitors’ advertising pressure, and potentially more extensive marketing campaigns, which may adversely affect our margins.

See “Business of the Group—Material Contracts—Wireless Network _Agreements—Bouygues Telecom Agreement”. This agreement aims to allow the two operators to offer their_ respective customers better geographic coverage and better quality of service, while optimizing costs and investments. The first deliveries of cellular plans occurred on April 30, 2014. It was at that time that each operator first became aware of the deployment plans and technical characteristics of its partner’s sites. The French Competition Authority had prohibited the exchange of technical information prior to the signing of the agreement, and the engineering guidelines had been established on the basis of assumptions that proved to be incorrect in some cases. The discussions that followed upon the initial deliveries of cellular plans led, on October 24, 2014, to adaptation of the agreement and, more specifically, of some engineering choices that had been made at the time when the initial agreement was signed. Prior to its completion, the target date for completing the network was delayed by one year, to account for the time needed to make these adjustments in the target network engineering. The target network is now expected to be completed in 2021. The Group could be exposed to various risks related to the implementation of the Bouygues Network Sharing Agreement as it will be dependent upon Bouygues Telecom for the part of its network that it is to be responsible for operating. In particular, it will not have any direct operational control over the portion of the network managed by Bouygues Telecom that is to be shared. Therefore, we will not be able to control the quality of the network provided to the customers involved or to implement corrective measures necessary in the event of defect and will be exposed to the risk of failure on the part of Bouygues Telecom. In addition, the Bouygues Network Sharing Agreement implemented could also fail to generate the expected synergies, especially in terms of geographic coverage or quality of service. Any delay in its implementation may affect the ability of the Group to achieve the aforementioned objectives of geographic coverage and quality of service. The implementation of the Bouygues Network Sharing Agreement will also require significant capital expenditures and there can be no assurance that the Group will be able to make a return on such investment or recoup such investment. Further, in the event of partial or total cessation and/or failure of the joint arrangement, the Group would have to redeploy a network in the zones covered up to that time by the Bouygues Network Sharing Agreement so as to maintain its geographic coverage and the quality of its services. Such redeployment could represent a major expense for the Group. Moreover, the Group cannot guarantee that it will be able, in such a scenario, to implement coverage equivalent to that enjoyed by customers under the Bouygues Network Sharing Agreement. The competent authorities may, in the future, make decisions jeopardizing the overall economics and/or validity of the Bouygues Network Sharing Agreement. Third parties may also seek to have access to the shared network and take action against the Group and its partner. On April 29, 2014, Orange filed a complaint with the French Competition Authority with regard to the Bouygues Network Sharing Agreement, alleging that it constituted an anti-competitive practice. Investigations on the merits are currently underway.

Within the framework of our B2C activity, such distribution occurs mainly through our spaces. For indirect distribution of our services, we rely on independent partners, in which we directly or indirectly hold minority stakes. In particular, the French telecommunications market is characterized by rapid change in the habits and needs of customers. Therefore, the Group is committed to adapting its distribution network accordingly in order to respond to new market characteristics. This evolution of the distribution network involves regular adaptation of indirect distribution and thus on the part of all of its independent partners. However, some of them might not have the ability or might not wish to implement the necessary adaptations. In addition, the Group is engaged in significant disputes with former or current partners, particularly demands to re-characterize agreements for joint arrangements as commercial agent agreements, to obtain compensation due to breakdowns in commercial relations, and to invoke the status of management employee, as well as demands from its own employees for recognition of the Group’s status as employer and for application of the employment status applicable inside of the “SFR Social and Economic Unit” (“UES”) convention. The Group has already implemented policies for adapting its contractual tools in order to prevent such risks and manage tailored protective policies, however it cannot guarantee that such claims will not increase or that the factual or legal arguments put forward by the Group to rebut these claims will be received favorably by the courts. In particular, the Group may be obligated to apply its employment status outside its current UES convention.

The Group remains attentive to_ environmental risks that might arise or be discovered in the future and it has adopted programs aimed at ensuring compliance with applicable environmental regulations. Environmental and health concerns are expressed in numerous countries and particularly arise in the context of the deployment of mobile technology regarding exposure to electromagnetic fields through telecommunications equipment, relay antennas and Wifi. A number of studies have been conducted to examine the health effects of mobile phone use and network sites, and some of these studies have been construed as indicating that radiation from mobile phone use causes adverse health effects. The World Health Organization has classified the radiofrequency of electromagnetic fields, linked particularly with the use of cordless phones, as “possibly carcinogenic to humans”, but, to date, no adverse health effects have been established as being caused by mobile phone use. Several lawsuits have been filed against mobile operators and other participants in the mobile industry alleging adverse health effects and other claims relating to radio frequency transmissions to and from sites, handsets and other mobile telecommunications devices. The perception of increased health risks related to mobile network sites may also cause the Group increased difficulty in obtaining leases for new mobile network site locations or renewing leases for existing locations or otherwise in installing mobile telecommunication devices. The fears generated by the potential health risks connected with electromagnetic waves could also lead third parties to act against the Group by, for example, bringing actions demanding the withdrawal of antennas or towers, which could ----- affect the Group’s conduct of operations and the deployment of our network, and could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial position and results of operations.

The Group has developed the brands it uses through extensive marketing campaigns, website promotions, customer referrals, and the use of a dedicated sales force and dealer networks. For a description of the Group’s brands and offers, see “Business of _the Group—Suppliers”._ These brands have been developed through extensive marketing campaigns, website promotions and customer referrals, and the use of a dedicated sales force and dealer networks. The Group’s success depends on its ability to maintain and enhance the image and reputation of its existing products and services and to develop a favorable image and reputation for new products and services. The image and reputation of the Group’s products and services may be adversely affected by several factors, including if concerns arise about (i) the quality, reliability and benefit/cost balance of its products and services, (ii) the quality of its support centers or (iii) its ability to deliver the level of service advertised. An event or series of events that threatens the reputation of one or more of the Group’s brands, or one or more of the Group’s products could have an adverse effect on the value of that brand or product and subsequent revenues therefrom. Restoring the image and reputation of the Group’s products and services may be costly and not always possible. The Group relies upon copyright, trademark and patent laws to establish and protect its intellectual property rights, but no assurance can be given that the actions they have taken or will take in the future will be adequate to prevent violation of our intellectual property rights.

High levels of sovereign debt in the U.S. and certain European countries combined with weak growth and high unemployment could lead to fiscal reforms (including austerity measures), sovereign debt restructurings, currency instability, increased counterparty credit risk, high levels of volatility and, potentially, disruptions in the credit and equity markets as well as other outcomes that might adversely impact our business and financial operations. In Europe, future developments are dependent upon a number of political and economic factors, including the effectiveness of measures by the EU Commission to address debt burdens of certain countries in Europe and the overall stability of the Eurozone. The current macroeconomic environment is highly volatile, and continuing instability in global markets, including instability related to international trade, tariffs, sovereign debt issues, the risk of deflation and the stability of the euro, has contributed to a challenging global economic environment. As France seeks to recover from any natural disasters and pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) or the French government seeks new sources of revenue due to high fiscal deficit, the government may impose new or increased taxes and levies. Accordingly, ----- our results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected if the macroeconomic environment remains uncertain or declines further or the government increases taxes or levies as a result of fiscal deficits, pandemics or natural disasters. We are currently unable to predict the extent of any of these potential adverse effects. Furthermore, we rely on third-party vendors for the equipment (including customer premises equipment, telecommunications equipment, network infrastructure and mobile handsets), software and services that we require in order to provide services to our customers. Our suppliers often conduct business worldwide and their ability to meet our needs is subject to various risks, including political and economic instability, international regulations or sanctions, natural calamities, interruptions in transportation systems or power supplies, terrorism, pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) and labor issues. With regard to currency instability issues, concerns exist in the Eurozone with respect to individual macro fundamentals on a country-by-country basis, as well as with respect to the overall stability of the European monetary union and the suitability of a single currency to appropriately deal with specific fiscal management and sovereign debt issues in individual Eurozone countries. Following Brexit on January 31, 2020, the U.K. entered into a transition period set to terminate on December 31, 2020 during which it will continue to apply European Union law. Thereafter, the effects of Brexit will depend, in part, on agreements the U.K negotiates during the transitional period to retain access to markets in the European Union, including current trade and finance agreements. Brexit has created substantial political uncertainty within the European Union, uncertainty in international financial markets and reduced economic growth in certain jurisdictions. It is possible that other members of the European monetary union could hold similar referendums regarding their membership within the Eurozone in the future. The realization of these concerns could lead to the exit of one or more countries from the European monetary union and the re-introduction of individual currencies in these countries or, in more extreme circumstances, the possible dissolution of the euro entirely, which could result in the redenomination of a portion or, in the extreme case, all of the Group’s euro-denominated assets, liabilities and cash flows to the new currency of the country in which they originated. This could result in a mismatch in the currencies of the Group’s assets, liabilities and cash flows. Any such mismatch, together with the capital market disruption that would likely accompany any such redenomination event, could have a material adverse impact on the Group’s liquidity and financial condition. Furthermore, any redenomination event would likely be accompanied by significant economic dislocation, particularly within the Eurozone countries, which in turn could have an adverse impact on demand for our products and, accordingly, on our revenue and cash flows. Moreover, any changes from euro to non-euro currencies in countries would require the Group to modify its billing and other financial systems. No assurance can be given that any required modifications could be made within a timeframe that would allow the Group to timely bill its customers or prepare and file required financial reports. In light of the significant exposure that the Group has to the euro through its euro-denominated borrowings, derivative instruments, cash balances and cash flows, a redenomination event could have a material adverse impact on the Group’s business. On November 8, 2013, Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services downgraded France’s sovereign debt rating by one notch to AA, where it currently stands. On December 13, 2014, France was downgraded by Fitch by one notch to AA, where it currently stands. On September 18, 2015, France was downgraded by Moody’s by one notch to Aa2, where it currently stands. There can be no guarantee that there will not be a downgrade of France’s sovereign debt rating in the future. Poor performance of the French economy, particularly due to a possible resurgence of the Eurozone debt crisis, could have a direct negative impact on consumer spending habits and on businesses in relation to products and their usage levels. Such poor performance could (i) make it more difficult for the Group to capture new subscribers and customers, (ii) increase the likelihood that some subscribers or customers of the Group might reduce the level of subscribed services or terminate their subscriptions and (iii) make it more difficult for the Group to keep its prices at current levels. Negative macroeconomic developments in France, in particular increasing levels of unemployment, may have a direct negative impact on the spending patterns of retail consumers, both in terms of the products they subscribe for and usage levels. Because a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from residential subscribers who may be impacted by these conditions, it may be more difficult to attract new subscribers and more likely that certain of the Group’s subscribers will downgrade or disconnect their services. In addition, we can provide no assurances that a deterioration of any of these economies will not lead to a higher number of non-paying customers or generally result in service disconnections. Similarly, a deterioration in economic conditions would be likely to adversely affect the demand for, and pricing of, our business services as a result of businesses and governments reducing spending. Therefore, a weak economy and negative economic development in the French markets may jeopardize our growth targets and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and ----- results of operations. In addition, adverse economic conditions (including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic) may lead to a rise in the number of our customers who are not able to pay for our services.

The severity and timing of the impact will depend on a number of factors, including the level and rapidity of infection, duration of the pandemic and related containment measures, changes in consumer spending patterns, measures imposed or taken by governmental authorities in response to the pandemic, macroeconomic conditions in our markets, and negative effects on the financial condition of our customers, suppliers and vendors. Under difficult economic conditions, including prolonged unemployment and employment furloughs, demand for our products and services could decline and some customers may be unable or unwilling to pay for our products and services. Additionally, in order to prioritize the demands of the business and/or depending on any restrictions that may be imposed by the French government on deployment of new infrastructure, we may, or may be required to, delay certain capital investments, such as FTTH or in other new initiatives, products or services, which may adversely affect our business in the future. If these events occur and were to continue, our revenue may be reduced materially which could result in reduced operating margins and a reduction in cash flows. Governmental and non-governmental initiatives to reduce the transmission of COVID-19, such as the imposition of restrictions on work and public gatherings and the promotion of social distancing, along with certain temporary regulations concerning collections, or changes in consumer behaviour, have impacted and could continue to impact our operations and financial results. Even though the strict lockdown in France was lifted on May 11, 2020, significant restrictions and social distancing measures remain in place, which continue to adversely affect the overall French economy and, in turn, our operations. If a significant portion of our workforce is unable to work effectively due to prolonged illness, quarantines, shelter-in-place arrangements, government actions, facility closures or other reasons in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, our operations could be further materially impacted. Our suppliers and vendors also may be affected by such measures in their ability to provide products and services to us and these measures could also make it more difficult for us to serve our customers. It is unclear whether measures taken by the French government to contain the COVID-19 pandemic in France are adequate and will be effective in achieving their goals. It is unclear when, if at all, the COVID-19 pandemic will be contained. We have implemented enhanced health and safety measures in our operations in line with public health rules and guidelines and industry practices to combat the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to the increase in costs associated with the implementation of such measures, we are also exposed to the risk of an increase in the number of workplace and third-party claims arising from actual or alleged failures to implement such measures adequately, or at all, and a potential increase in legal, advisory and other costs as a result of any COVID-19 pandemic related claims from workers or third party customers and suppliers that may come into contact with our operations. Financial markets have been experiencing extreme fluctuations that may cause a contraction in available liquidity globally as important segments of the markets react to the development. The pandemic may lead to a decline in business and consumer confidence and presents the risk of an economic recession in France and around the globe, which could adversely impact our results. Further, political repercussions of responses to the COVID-19 pandemic by European Union institutions as well as by other countries in the European Union could have complex and hard-to-predict consequences for the future, including a destabilization of the European Union or its institutions or a slow-down or reversal of European integration.

These estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are considered by our management to be reasonable under the circumstances and at the time. These estimates and assumptions form the basis of judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources. Areas requiring more complex judgments may shift over time based on changes business mix and industry practice which could affect our reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. In addition, management’s judgments, estimates and assumptions and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses may be affected by changes in accounting policy. In January 2016, the IASB issued a new standard coming into effect on January 1, 2019, IFRS 16 (Leases), which has superseded the current standard (IAS 17) and its current interpretations. IFRS 16 specifies how to recognize, measure, present and disclose leases. The standard provides a single lessee accounting model, requiring lessees to recognize assets and liabilities for all leases unless the lease term is 12 months or less or the underlying asset has a sufficiently low value. IFRS 16 applies to annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019. The Group has applied IFRS 16 using the modified retrospective method, with the date of initial application of January 1, 2019. Under this method, the standard is applied retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard recognized at the date of the initial application. IFRS 16 had a significant impact on our consolidated statement of financial position from periods beginning on January 1, 2019, due to the recognition of rights-of-use related to leased assets and corresponding lease liabilities. Moreover, our consolidated statement of profit or loss was impacted as operating lease expenses no longer comprise a part of operating expenses, but instead fall under depreciation and interest expenses. The Group’s consolidated statement of cash flows was also impacted given that payment for lease liabilities is now presented within financing activities. The principal effects of the application of IFRS 16 on our consolidated statement of financial position and results of operations as of January 1, 2019, were a recognition of right-of-use (“ROU”) assets of €3,233 million which include the lease assets in the amount of €121 million previously recognized under finance leases and reclassified from the property, plant and equipment and intangible assets line items, and an increase in lease liabilities by €3,214 million, of which the current and non-current liabilities increased by €663 million and €2,551 million, respectively. The Group has completed its assessment of IFRS 16 with respect to subsurfacing rights and has concluded that in its relevant contracts, the suppliers have a substantive right to substitute the asset throughout the period of use and therefore, such contracts do not constitute a lease. For further details on new accounting standards that may have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements, see note 1.2 to the 2019 Financial Statements and note 1.2 to the Unaudited Financial Statements, in each case, included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

The Group cannot provide any assurance that its businesses will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future debt or equity financing will be available to the Group in an amount sufficient to enable the Group to pay its debt obligations when due. The ability of the Group to generate cash flows and finance its capital expenditures, current operations, and debt service obligations depends on numerous factors, including: - its future operating performance; - the demand and price levels for its current and projected products and services; - its ability to maintain the level of technical capacity required on its networks and the subscriber equipment and other pertinent equipment connected to the Group’s networks; - its ability to successfully introduce new products and services; - its ability to reduce the churn rate; - the general economic conditions and other circumstances affecting consumer spending; - competition; - sufficient distributable reserves, in accordance with applicable law; - the outcome of certain disputes in which it is involved; and - legal, tax and regulatory developments affecting the Group’s business. Some of these factors are beyond the control of the Group. If the Group is not able to generate sufficient cash flows it might not be able to repay its debt, expand its business, respond to competitive challenges, or finance its other cash and capital requirements, including capital expenditures. If the Group is not able to meet its debt service obligations, it might have to sell off assets, attempt to restructure or refinance its existing debt or seek additional financing in the form of debt or equity.

These covenants restrict the Group’s ability, and the ability of its subsidiaries, to, among other things: - pay dividends or make other distributions; - make certain investments or acquisitions, including participating in joint ventures; - make capital expenditures; - engage in transactions with affiliates and other related parties; - dispose of assets other than in the ordinary course of business; - merge with other companies; - incur additional debt and grant guarantees; - repurchase or redeem equity interests and subordinated debt or issue shares of subsidiaries; and ----- - grant liens and pledge assets. All of these limitations are subject to certain exceptions and qualifications, including the ability to pay dividends, make investments or to make significant prepayments of shareholder debt. However, these covenants could limit the Group’s ability to finance our future operations and capital needs and the Group’s ability to pursue business opportunities and activities that may be in our interest. In addition, the Group’s ability to comply with these restrictions may be affected by events beyond our control. In addition, the Group is also subject to the affirmative covenants contained in certain of the debt agreements it is a party to, which requires us to maintain specified leverage ratios, see “Description of Other Indebtedness”. The Group’s ability to meet these leverage ratios may be affected by events beyond its control and, as a result, the Group cannot assure you that it will be able to meet these ratios. In addition to limiting our flexibility in operating our business, the breach of any covenants or obligations under the agreements and instruments governing the Group’s debt may result in a default under the applicable debt agreement or instrument and could trigger the acceleration of related debt, which in turn could trigger defaults under agreements governing our other debt.

16,Final Offerings 2020.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.2,Risks Relating to the Group’s Financial Profile,1.2.5,The Group is exposed to interest rate risks. Shifts in such rates may adversely affect its debt service obligations.,"The Group is exposed to the risk of fluctuations in interest rates, primarily under the Existing Term Loans. In addition, any amounts the Group borrows under the Existing Revolving Credit Facilities will bear interest at a floating rate. See “Description of Other Indebtedness”. An increase in the interest rates on the Group’s debt will reduce the funds available to repay its debt and to finance its operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities. The Group enters into various derivative transactions to manage exposure to movements in interest rates; however, there can be no assurance that it will be able to continue to do so at a reasonable cost. There can be no guarantee that the Group’s hedging strategies will adequately protect the Group from the effects of interest rate fluctuation, or that these hedges will not limit any benefit that we might otherwise receive from favorable movements in interest rates. Following allegations of manipulation of LIBOR, regulators and law enforcement agencies from a number of governments and the European Union are conducting investigations into whether the banks that contribute data in connection with the calculation of daily EURIBOR or the calculation of LIBOR may have been manipulating or attempting to manipulate EURIBOR and LIBOR. In addition, LIBOR, EURIBOR and other interest rates or other types of rates and indices which are deemed to be “benchmarks” are the subject of ongoing national and international regulatory reform, including the implementation of the IOSCO Principles for Financial Market Benchmarks (July 2013) and the new European regulation on indices used as benchmarks in financial instruments and financial contracts or to measure the performance of investment funds, which entered into force on June 30, 2016. Following the implementation of any such reforms, the manner of administration of benchmarks may change, with the result that they may perform differently than in the past, or benchmarks could be eliminated entirely, or there could be other consequences which cannot be predicted. For example, on July 27, 2017, the UK Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”) announced that it will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of the LIBOR benchmark after 2021 (the “FCA Announcement”). The FCA Announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed after 2021. The ----- potential elimination of the LIBOR benchmark or any other benchmark, changes in the manner of administration of any benchmark, or actions by regulators or law enforcement agencies could result in changes to the manner in which EURIBOR or LIBOR is determined, which could require an adjustment to the terms and conditions, or result in other consequences, in respect of any debt linked to such benchmark (including, but not limited to, the Existing Revolving Credit Facilities and/or the Existing Term Loans having interest rates that are linked to LIBOR or EURIBOR, as applicable). Any such change, as well as manipulative practices or the cessation thereof, may result in a sudden or prolonged increase in reported EURIBOR or LIBOR, which could have an adverse impact on the Group’s ability to service debt that bears interest at floating rates of interest.",,,,
16,Final Offerings 2020.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.2,Risks Relating to the Group’s Financial Profile,1.2.6,Changes or uncertainty in respect of LIBOR may affect the Group’s sources of funding.,"Some of the Group’s sources of funding are linked to LIBOR. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Term _Loans” and “Description of Other Indebtedness—Revolving Credit Facilities”. Various interest rate benchmarks_ (including LIBOR) are the subject of recent regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. Some reforms are already effective while others are still to be implemented, including the EU Benchmark Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/1011). In addition, the sustainability of LIBOR has been questioned by the FCA as a result of the absence of relevant active underlying markets and possible disincentives (including possibly as a result of regulatory reforms) for market participants to continue contributing to such benchmarks. On November 29, 2017, the Bank of England and the FCA announced that the market Working Group on Sterling Risk-Free Rates would have an extended mandate to catalyze a broad transition to the Sterling Over Night Index Average rate (“SONIA”) across sterling bond, loan and derivatives markets so that SONIA is established as the primary sterling interest rate benchmark by the end of 2021. The Bank of England and FCA have stated that a key near-term priority for the Working Group will be to make recommendations relating to the potential development of term SONIA reference rates. These reforms and other pressures may cause such benchmarks to disappear entirely, to perform differently than in the past (as a result of a change in methodology or otherwise), create disincentives for market participants to continue to administer or participate in certain benchmarks or have other consequences which cannot be predicted. Based on the foregoing, investors should in particular be aware that: - any of the reforms or pressures described above or any other changes to a relevant interest rate benchmark (including LIBOR) could affect the level of the published rate, including to cause it to be lower and/or more volatile than it would otherwise be; and - if LIBOR is discontinued, then the rate of interest applicable to the Group’s sources of funding may be determined for a period by applicable fall-back provisions, although such provisions, often being dependent in part upon the provision by reference banks of offered quotations for the LIBOR rate, may not operate as intended (depending on market circumstances and the availability of rates information at the relevant time) and may in certain circumstances result in the effective application of a fixed rate based on the rate which applied in the previous period when LIBOR was available. More generally, any of the above matters or any other significant change to the setting or existence of LIBOR could affect the Group’s ability to meet our obligations under the Group’s sources of funding and/or could have a material adverse effect on the liquidity of, and the amount payable under, the Group’s sources of funding. See also “—The Group is exposed to interest rate risks. Shifts in such rates may adversely affect the Group’s debt _service obligations.” Changes in the manner of administration of LIBOR could result in adjustments to the_ conditions applicable to the Group’s sources of funding or other consequences relevant to the Group’s sources of funding.

The primary transactional currency of the Group is euro and most of the Group’s revenues and operating cash flows are in euro. The Group conducts, and will continue to conduct, transactions in currencies other than such primary transactional currencies, particularly the U.S. dollar. A significant portion of the Group’s existing debt is denominated in U.S. dollars. The exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the euro has fluctuated significantly in recent years and may continue to fluctuate significantly in the future. The Group has historically covered a portion of our U.S. dollar cash outflows arising on anticipated and committed obligations through the use of foreign exchange derivative instruments. Further, while we manage the risk of certain currency fluctuations in respect of a portion of our existing debt and to hedge our exposure to interest rate changes in respect of indebtedness linked to interest rates, these arrangements may be costly and may not insulate us completely from such exposure.

The ratings may not reflect the potential impact of all risks related to the structure, market, additional risk factors discussed herein and other factors that may affect the value of the Notes. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal by the rating agency at any time. No assurance can be given that a credit rating will remain constant for any given period of time or that a credit rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by the credit rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances in the future so warrant. A suspension, reduction or withdrawal at any time of the credit rating assigned to the Notes by one or more of the credit rating agencies may adversely affect the cost and terms and conditions of our financings and could adversely affect the value and trading of such Notes. A downgrade in our credit rating may negatively affect the Group’s ability to obtain future financing to fund our operations and capital needs, which may affect our liquidity. It may also increase our financing costs by increasing the interest rates of our outstanding debt or the interest rates at which it is able to refinance existing debt or incur additional debt. There can be no assurance that the Group’s corporate rating, or the instrument rating with respect to the Notes, will be maintained at existing levels. See “—Risks Relating to the Notes—Credit ratings may not _reflect all risks”._ Because the financial condition, revenues and profitability of our operating subsidiaries are closely linked to the economies of their countries of operations, we expect that the Group as a whole will also be impacted by any downgrading in the sovereign debt rating of such countries.

Such regulation and supervision, as well as future changes in laws or regulations or in their interpretation or enforcement that affect us, our competitors or our industry, strongly influence how we operate our business. Complying with existing and future law and regulations may increase our operational and administrative expenses, restrict the Group’s ability or make it more difficult to implement price increases, affect the Group’s ability to introduce new services, force us to change our marketing and other business practices, and/or otherwise limit our revenues. In particular, our business could be materially and adversely affected by any changes in relevant laws or regulations (or in their interpretation) regarding, for example, licensing requirements, access and price regulation, interconnection arrangements or the imposition of universal service obligations, or any change in policy allowing more favorable conditions for other operators or increasing competition. There can be no assurance to you that the provision of our services will not be subject to greater regulation in the future. Furthermore, a failure to comply with the applicable rules and regulations could result in penalties, restrictions on our business or loss of required licenses or other adverse consequences. Although the regulations applicable to our business vary, such regulations may include, amongst other things: - price regulation for certain of the services we offer, exit fees and cancellation charges; - rules governing the interconnection between different telephone networks and the interconnection rates that we can charge and that we pay; - requirements that, under specified circumstances, a cable system carry certain broadcast stations or obtain consent to carry a broadcast station; - rules for authorizations, licensing, acquisitions, renewals and transfers of licenses and franchises; - requirements that we provide or contribute to the provision of certain universal services; - rules and regulations relating to subscriber privacy and data protection; ----- - rules and regulations relating to our networks, including universal access obligations imposed on us, coinstallation and co-location obligations (including our submarine cable landing stations), right of way and ownership considerations; - rules governing the copyright royalties; requirements on portability; and - other requirements covering a variety of operational areas such as equal employment opportunity, emergency alert systems, disability access, technical standards, environmental standards, city planning rules and customer service and consumer protection requirements. The regulations applicable to our operations within the EU often derive from EU Directives. The various Directives require EU Member States to harmonize their laws on communications and cover such issues as access, user rights, privacy and competition. These Directives are reviewed by the EU from time to time and any changes to them could lead to substantial changes in the way in which our business is regulated and to which we would have to adapt. In addition, the Group is subject to antitrust rules and regulations and are, from time to time, subject to review by authorities concerning whether we exhibit monopoly power in any of the market in which we operate. To the extent that the Group is deemed by relevant authorities to exhibit significant market power, we can be subject to various regulatory obligations adversely affecting our results of operations and profitability. Regulatory authorities may also require the Group to grant third parties access to our bandwidth, frequency capacity, facilities or services to distribute their own services or resell our services to end customers. Currently, the Group is considered to have significant market power in France. No assurance can be given that we will not be identified as having significant market power in the future and we will not be subject to additional regulatory requirements.",,,,
16,Final Offerings 2020.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.3,Risks Relating to Legislative and Regulatory Matters,1.3.2,Future regulatory changes could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business.,"The Group is subject to the provisions of the French Postal and Electronic Communications Code (“CPCE”), which imposes certain general obligations on all operators and certain specific obligations on mobile operators. The French regulatory framework applicable to operators is also subject to the analysis of the relevant markets carried out by the French telecom regulator (“ARCEP”) which is charged with (i) defining the relevant markets in France, (ii) analyzing the markets or identifying the companies reputed for exercising significant influence on these markets and (iii) deciding whether or not to impose on these companies regulatory obligations to remedy the effects of such influence. The Group is not considered by ARCEP to be an operator deemed to have significant influence over a relevant market, except over the markets for voice-call termination on its fixed and mobile networks. Nevertheless, it cannot be guaranteed that the Group, in the future, will not be identified by ARCEP as an operator deemed to exercise significant power in one or more relevant markets, and that ARCEP will not therefore impose additional regulatory obligations in this regard. For example, the possibility cannot be excluded that, in the future, particularly in the context of a growth in FTTH networks, the Group may be required to grant competitors some access to its fiber optic network, under conditions to be determined. At the request of the French Competition Authority, ARCEP has recently issued an opinion addressing the issues raised by the digital revolution currently affecting the audiovisual sector (ARCEP opinion dated October 11, 2018). In this document, ARCEP provided an overview of audiovisual content broadcasting techniques (DTT, copper and fiber networks, satellite, OTT and cable networks) before detailing the sector’s recent evolutions at both the operator and consumer ends, emphasizing the necessity to determine a common technical framework for these new services. ARCEP has not provided a timeline for the determination of such framework and has recommended the implementation of a horizontal regulation for all devices allowing access to audiovisual content. As the technical framework develops, the Group may be subject to ongoing obligations. The Group is also subject to other individual obligations resulting from the approvals to use frequencies. See “— _The Group can only operate its business for as long as it has licenses from the relevant authorities and it may not be able to obtain, retain or review the licenses and authorizations necessary for conducting its activities.”_ In September 2017, the French government asked ARCEP to begin work on the binding commitments that mobile operators were likely to make, above and beyond their existing rollout plans. Based on ARCEP’s proposals, and as part of a dialogue with mobile network operators, the French Government reached an agreement that aims to ----- ensure the availability of a high standard of mobile coverage for every person in France. With respect to these elements, mobile operators have committed to: - improving reception quality across the entire country, and particularly in rural areas. The new baseline quality standard applied to operators’ obligations will be that of “good coverage”; - increasing the pace of targeted programmes for improving coverage, with each operator deploying at least 5,000 new cell sites across the country to this end, some of which will be shared, which will henceforth go beyond so-called “white areas” and for which operators will now be fully responsible. Over the next three years, we will bring coverage to as many areas as the total number covered by government programmes over the past fifteen years. Government authorities will work closely with local authorities to identify the areas that need to be covered; - achieving ubiquitous 4G coverage, which will mean bringing it to more than a million additional people in 10,000 municipalities in France, by making every cell site 4G-capable; - accelerating the coverage of transportation routes, so that all of the major roads and railways have 4G coverage. The agreement also provides for coverage on regional railway lines; and - achieving ubiquitous indoor telephone coverage, notably by using voice over Wi-Fi. Facilitated by an increase of network sharing which ensures more efficient rollouts, along with a planned simplification of the measures contained in the new housing bill, stepping up the pace of deployment for new mobile phone equipment will significantly improve the user experience of mobile coverage in every part of the country. On July 3, 2018, ARCEP handed down a decision (decision no. 2018-0684) setting out the conditions under which licenses for 900 MHz, 1800 MHz and 2100 GHz-band frequencies may be granted in 2021, 2022 and 2024. One of these conditions is that operators are required to take actions to achieve the goals set out in Articles L. 32 et seq. of the CPCE (digital development of the French territory, fair and effective competition between operators on the mobile market and effective management and use of the frequency spectrum). Mobile operator frequency licences granted in July 2018 are now binding and a failure to meet these new obligations will result in sanctions from ARCEP. On June 4, 2019, ARCEP updated its mobile new deal roadmap underlining the priority of deploying and/or enhancing the quality of mobile coverage on highways and other strategic transport networks. On July 12, 2019, a new decree regarding network coverage obligations was passed. This decree identifies specific interests locations (strategic sites) that must be covered by mobile networks or in which the quality of the services provided must be improved by the operators. The decree no. 2019-1592 of December 31, 2019, initiated the 5G public tender and the ministerial decree of December 30, 2019 determined modalities and conditions for the tender. 31 frequencies in the 10 MHz band will be allocated as follows: - Four blocks of 50 MHz are expected to be allocated at a set price provided the operators agree on several commitments detailed in the tender specifications; and - The remaining frequencies will be allocated through an auction process, per blocks of 10 MHz. SFR, Orange, Free Mobile and Bouygues Telecom have agreed to obtain one of the four blocks of 50 MHz (comprising five blocks of 10 MHz each). On April 2, 2020, ARCEP announced that: - the four candidates were qualified; ----- - the four candidates had made the commitments set out in the specifications, and each will be able to obtain a block of 50 MHz at the end of this procedure, for the sum of €350 million. The four candidates are now authorised to participate in the auction stage, during which the 11 blocks of 10 MHz that remain available in the 3.4 – 3.8 GHz band will be awarded. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the main auction to award the remaining 11 blocks of 10 MHz have been postponed. Their allocation is scheduled to be launched on September 29, 2020. The Group monitors the regulations to which it is subject; however, the weight of the regulatory burden on “electronic” telecommunications operators, including the Group, may change and may lead to the application of different obligations in their regard depending on the level of ownership of direct access networks and the level of market power that may be more or less significant to or constrictive upon certain operators by virtue of changes in the technology used for providing services. If the Group becomes subject to regulations relatively more constrictive than its competitors, this could have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations or financial position. Furthermore, as an “electronic” telecommunications operator and a distributor of television services, the Group is subject to special taxes. The burden of such taxes could increase in the future due to changes in legislation. In addition, the Group cannot guarantee that additional taxes will not be instituted in the telecommunications industry. Any future restrictions on the Group’s ability to market its products or services in the way it wishes could have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations or financial position.",,,,
16,Final Offerings 2020.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.3,Risks Relating to Legislative and Regulatory Matters,1.3.3,The European Commission’s “Digital Single Market” legislation could adversely affect the Group’s businesses.,"The EU Regulation 531/2012, which initially set a rate for roaming, was further amended through the regulation 2015/2120 of 25/11/2015 to establish the conditions and the viability of a removal of retail roaming charges from June 15, 2017 (“roam like at home” subject to fair-usage). Moreover, the regulation introduces measures relating to “net neutrality”. Furthermore, the roaming regulation was completed by other pieces of legislation: - Implementing regulation EU 2016/2286 of 15/12/2016 laying down detailed rules on the application of fair use policy and on the methodology for assessing the sustainability of the abolition of retail roaming surcharges and on the application to be submitted by a roaming provider for the purposes of that assessment; and - Regulation UE 2017/920 of 17/05/2017 amending Regulation (EU) No 531/2012 with respect to rules for wholesale roaming markets. The Commission’s proposals on telecommunications markets presented in September 2016 intends to fix rules to support the creation of Gigabit Society. The electronic communications code proposal aims to make investment in very high capacity networks a binding objective and it also aims to promote sustainable long term competition. It was adopted through Directive 2018/1972 of December 11, 2018 establishing the European Electronic Communications Code (the “EECC”), which entered into force on December 20, 2018. This legislation is expected to have both a positive and adverse effect on revenue generated from the Group’s operations due to anticipated price decreases, higher operational costs and increased competition. All of these factors may adversely affect the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations. The EECC brings together the rules on electronic communications networks and services and aligns them with the latest technological developments. The EECC regulates (i) electronic communications networks and services (“ECN” and “ECS”), (ii) associated facilities and services, (iii) the authorisation of networks and services, (iv) radio spectrum use and numbering resources, (v) access to and interconnection of electronic communications networks and associated facilities and (vi) the protection of end-users. It aims to: - Promote connectivity, access to and take-up of very high capacity networks by all citizens and businesses of the EU; - Promote competition in the provision of electronic communication networks and services; ----- - Contribute to the development of the internal market in the field of electronic communications networks and services, radio spectrum, and connectivity; and - Promote the interests of European citizens. The EECC has singled out citizen connectivity as a key objective for the EU, since it is instrumental in guaranteeing freedom of expression, pluralism, democracy, culture, social cohesion, and even safety. The EECC also adopts a broader definition of ECS to regulate services delivered via internet (known as “over-the-top” or “OTT” services). ECS now includes internet access services, interpersonal communications services (“ICS”), and services consisting wholly or mainly in the conveyance of signals. The EECC also provides for strategic planning and coordination of a radio spectrum policy, as well as for effective management of radio spectrum by Member States. Finally, national regulation authorities are responsible for ensuring access, interconnection, and the interoperability of services. Consequently, and under certain circumstances, they can impose on undertakings obligations such as interconnecting networks, ensuring the interoperability of their services and granting physical access to their infrastructure. A public concertation was initiated on December 2019 with regard to the transposition into French national law of the EECC. The concertation covers the following topics: - the maximum duration of the contracts between customers and service providers, - framing the conditions under which bundled offers (mobile phone and plan) can be offered to the customers, - the regulation of added value services, - the termination conditions (to ensure that termination provisions do not carry any deterrent effect), and - the conditions under which service providers who refuse to respect the provisions of the EECC (number portability, change of operator, etc.) can be sanctioned.

For a description of the legal status of the Group’s cable network see “Regulation—Legal Status of Networks”. The Group’s telecommunications network is essentially composed of the physical infrastructure (conduits, network head-ends, switches and radio frequency stations) in which telecommunications (mainly cable) equipment is installed. These components of the Group’s network are subject to different legal regimes. As the Group does not own certain land where such physical infrastructures are located and infrastructure is established on public or private property, it has entered into concessions, rights-of-way, leases or even IRUs with the owners of the land. In order to establish a substantial part of its telecommunications network and of its wireless network, the Group has thus entered into public and private property occupancy agreements with public and private entities or holds public property occupancy permits. Under these agreements or permits, the Group may install its network equipment along roads, highways, railways or canals, for example. No transfer of ownership takes place within this framework. Such agreements are entered into for terms that vary greatly, from 3 to 25 years. The Group does not have any right to renewal of such agreements, although the agreements with the shortest terms generally provide for tacit renewal. The Group’s occupancy of public property, as is the case for all occupants of public property, is always precarious and subject to considerations beyond the Group’s control. The public entities with which the Group has entered into these agreements or that have issued permits to it can thus at any time terminate these public property occupancy agreements for misconduct or for reasons of public interest and some of the agreements even exclude any compensation in such case. ----- If the Group fails to obtain such renewal, the company involved would be obliged, upon expiration of these agreements, (i) to return the site to its original condition upon the demand of the manager or owner of the public property involved and/or (ii) to transfer to the latter, in certain cases for the payment of compensation and in certain cases free of charge, ownership of the facilities established on the property involved. If the Group loses all or part of the rights relating to its network, it could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial position, results of operations or outlook of the Group.",,,,
16,Final Offerings 2020.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.3,Risks Relating to Legislative and Regulatory Matters,1.3.5,"The Group can only operate its business for as long as it has licenses from the relevant authorities and it may not be able to obtain, retain or review the licenses and authorizations necessary for conducting its activities.","The Group is required to hold licenses, franchises, permits and similar authorizations to own and operate the Group’s networks and to broadcast its signal to its customers. These authorizations generally require that we comply with applicable laws and regulations, meet certain solvency requirements and maintain minimum levels of service. Should the Group fail to comply with these, it may be subject to financial penalties from the relevant authorities and there may also be a risk that licenses could be partially or totally withdrawn. The imposition of fines and/or the withdrawal of licenses could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition and prevent us from conducting the Group’s business. In addition, such authorizations are generally granted for fixed terms and must be periodically renewed. The procedure for obtaining or renewing these licenses can be long and costly and authorities often demand concessions or other commitments as a condition for renewal. In addition, these licenses may not be obtainable or renewable in a timely manner or at all. In some instances, such authorizations have not been renewed at expiration, and we have operated and are operating under either temporary operating agreements or without an authorization while negotiating renewal terms with the local franchising authorities. Should we not be able to obtain or renew the licenses needed to operate or develop our business in a timely fashion, the Group’s ability to realize our strategic objectives may be compromised. In certain cases the Group’s mobile licenses require it to comply with certain obligations (population coverage, sharing in certain areas, national roaming) and the Group may suffer adverse consequences if is not able to comply with these obligations. In certain countries, we have provided significant bank guarantees to guarantee our performance under our licenses. If the Group is found to be in material breach of our licenses, the guarantees may be forfeited and our licenses may be revoked. Some of the Group’s activities depend on obtaining or renewing licences issued by regulatory authorities, particularly ARCEP in the telecommunications field and CSA in the audiovisual field. Under the licences allocated to the Group’s subsidiaries, the latter have committed themselves to complying with certain obligations (population coverage, sharing in some areas, roaming allowance). The Group is required to deploy a 3G and 4G generation radio network adhering to certain rates of coverage for the metropolitan population according to a given timetable. Within the framework of its 4G licences, if certain conditions are met, the Group will eventually have to allow Free Mobile roaming on a portion of its 4G network. The Group will also have to provide coverage, in conjunction with other 800 MHz band holders and under its 2G licence, for the city centers identified under the “white zones” plan, and accede to reasonable requests for network sharing in a priority deployment zone. The Group will also have to accede to reasonable requests to allow MVNOs throughout its very-high-speed mobile network open to the public in Metropolitan France. A failure to adhere to any one of these commitments could put the Group at risk under its regulatory obligations and possibly expose it to penalties (fines, total or partial suspension or withdrawal of licence). This could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial position, results of operations or outlook of the Group. To provide the Group’s various stakeholders with certainty over the future of some spectrum resources and with a view to issuing a call for applications that will enable a reallocation of longstanding 2G and 3G frequency bands for a period of 10 years (the licences relating to which will begin to expire in 2021), ARCEP has laid the ground rules for public consultation on the terms and conditions for such reallocation in its decision no. 2018-0684. The frequencies concerned are the frequencies in the 900 and 1800 MHz bands that were allocated to Orange, the Group and Bouygues Telecom in 2006 and 2009 for 15 years, and the 2.1 GHz band frequencies allocated to these same three operators in 2001 and 2002 for 20 years. Some of the existing 900, 1800 and 2100 MHz frequency licences for Metropolitan France are set to expire in 2021, 2022 and 2024. The terms for allocating frequencies seek to satisfy two main goals: digital regional development and achieving fair and effective competition between operators. The call for applications procedures for the allocation of 900, 1800 and 2100 MHz band frequencies took into account the goal of ensuring fair and effective competition in the mobile market by implementing the conditions needed to ensure that all mobile operators have fair and equal access to spectrum. It has been approved by the Minister responsible for electronic communications who launched the allocation procedure in early August 2018. The licences were awarded by ARCEP on November 15, 2018, and the frequencies will be made available starting in 2021. ----- The acquisition of licences also represents a high cost, the timing of which varies depending on when the frequencies involved are auctioned. Furthermore, this cost could rise due to strong competitive pressure in the telecommunications field. If we fail to obtain or retain, in a timely manner, the licences necessary for performing, continuing or developing our activities, the Group’s ability to achieve our strategic objectives could be subjected to alteration. In addition, the Group may fail to be awarded the desired licences, which could have an adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial position, results of operations or outlook. For further information on the licences and authorizations necessary for performance of the Group’s activities, see “Regulation”.",,,,
16,Final Offerings 2020.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.3,Risks Relating to Legislative and Regulatory Matters,1.3.6,There are uncertainties about the legal framework under which we own and operate certain of our networks.,"The Group’s systems depend on extensive physical facilities (lines, network, headends, switches and radio stations) in which telecommunication equipment (mainly cables) is installed. Significant portions of those physical facilities occupy public rights of way and are subject to governmental regulations. Other portions occupy private property under express or implied easements or pursuant to leases, and many miles of the cable are attached to utility poles governed by pole attachment agreements or other commercial arrangements. No assurances can be given that we will be able to maintain and use our facilities in their current locations and at their current costs. Changes in governmental regulations or changes in these relationships could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business and results of operations. In particular, the legal status of the Group’s network is complex, mainly governed by public and in certain cases subject to challenges or renewals. The Group’s telecommunications network is essentially composed of the physical infrastructure (conduits, network head-ends, switches and radio frequency stations) in which telecommunications (mainly cable) equipment is installed.

16,Final Offerings 2020.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.3,Risks Relating to Legislative and Regulatory Matters,1.3.7,The Group is subject to requirements in terms of protection of personal data and data security.,"Within the context of our business activities, we must collect and process personal data. In the EU, the European Parliament and the European Council adopted the regulation on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation, the “GDPR”) on April 27, 2016. The GDPR has been directly applicable in all EU member states since May 25, 2018, replacing Directive 95/46/EC and current national data protection legislation in member states, and was implemented in the EEA countries with effect from the same date. The GDPR significantly changes the EU/EEA data protection landscape, including strengthening of individuals’ rights, stricter requirements on companies processing personal data and stricter sanctions with substantial administrative fines. The GDPR also offers data subjects the option to let a privacy organization litigate on their behalf, including collecting the potential damages. After an initial transition period, data protection authorities across the EU have now begun using their new sanctioning powers (in 2019, Google was fined ----- €50 million by the French authority (CNIL), British Airways and Marriott were provisionally fined £183 million and £99 million, respectively by the UK authority (ICO), and many cases are currently under investigation). The Group does business in the hosting of data relating to the health of individuals, which subjects us to the specific obligations provided for by the Public Health Code such as obtaining and maintaining authorization or certification for the hosting of such data. If we breach our obligations or fail to adhere to the requirements applicable to sensitive data processing, the Group may be subjected to criminal and financial penalties likely to have a material adverse impact on our business, financial position and results of operations. In its judgment on October 6, 2015 (known as the “Schrems Judgment”), the European Court of Justice overturned the decision by the European Commission that the transfer of European personal data to the United States under the “Safe Harbor” framework provides an adequate level of protection. The successor “Privacy Shield” agreement negotiated by representatives of the EU and the United States have been overturned by a judgment of the European Court of Justice of July 16, 2020 (case C-311/18, known as “Schrems II”) which could impact our business and results. In 2016, the CJEU further clarified what safeguards are required for data retention to be lawful. In the case of Tele2 Sverige and Home Secretary v. Watson, the court concluded that Member States cannot impose a general obligation on providers of electronic telecommunications services to retain data, but did not ban data retention altogether. Such retention is compatible with EU law if deployed against specific targets to fight serious crime. Retention measures must be necessary and proportionate regarding the categories of data to be retained, the means of communication affected, the persons concerned and the chosen duration of retention. Furthermore, national authorities’ access to the retained data must be conditional and meet certain data protection safeguards. New data retention rules are currently being discussed at an EU level in response to this decision. In the case of Breyer, the CJEU concluded that Internet Protocol addresses may constitute personal data where the individual concerned can be identified, even where a third party must obtain additional data for the identification to take place. The CJEU also held that website operators may rely on a legitimate interest as a legal basis when retaining and using their visitors’ personal data. This is of major importance for data retention rules; it follows that online media service providers can lawfully store their visitors’ personal data to pursue a legitimate interest, rather than just for the purposes previously outlined in the invalidated Data Retention Directive. Thus, the grounds justifying data retention have become broader. The French legal framework for data protection has been gradually brought in line with the GDPR and the Police and Justice Directive. The French Data Protection Law of January 6, 1978 (Law no. 78-17), was amended by Law no. 2018-493 of June 20, 2018 and its implementing decree, and by decree no. 2018-687 of August 1, 2018. Such Law was rewritten and made consistent with GDPR by Order no. 2018-1225 of December 12, 2018. Finally, a new decree implementing the Law, no. 2019-536 of May 29, 2019 came into force on June 1, 2019. The French legal framework for data protection has now been stabilised. It imposes obligations on companies processing personal data in the context of the activities of an establishment in France concerning the conditions in which such a company may process personal data of individuals, the obtaining of their consent with respect to such processing (especially for the use of cookies) and carrying out the necessary measures for disclosure and transfer of data outside of the EU. Any breach of these obligations may lead to criminal and administrative financial penalties against us and damage to our reputation. On June 28, 2019, the French data protection authority (CNIL) announced new guidelines on the use of cookies for direct marketing purposes (online targeted advertisement), ruling out the use of implied or “soft” consent to place cookies on users’ devices. To assist companies in complying with these new rules, the CNIL published a draft recommendation on cookies on January 14, 2020 and the new legal regime applicable in France regarding cookies should be stabilised by the end of 2020. Regardless of the measures we adopt to protect the confidentiality, security of data and respect the rights of the people whose data we process, there remains the risk of possible attacks or breaches of data processing systems, which could give rise to penalties and damage our reputation. The Group could be compelled to incur additional costs in order to protect against these risks or to mitigate the consequences thereof, which could in turn have a material adverse impact on our business, financial position, results of operations or outlook. Furthermore, any loss of confidence on the part of our customers as a result of such events could lead to a significant decline in sales and have a material adverse impact on our business, financial position and results of operations. -----",,,,
16,Final Offerings 2020.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.3,Risks Relating to Legislative and Regulatory Matters,1.3.8,The Group’s business may suffer if it cannot continue to license or enforce the intellectual property rights on which our business depends or if it is subject to claims of intellectual property infringement.,"The Group relies primarily on copyright, trademark and trade secret laws and licenses and other agreements with our employees, customers, suppliers and other parties to establish and maintain our intellectual property rights in content, technology and products and services used to conduct our businesses. However, our intellectual property rights or those of our licensors could be challenged or invalidated, we could have difficulty protecting or obtaining such rights or the rights may not be sufficient to permit us to take advantage of business opportunities, which could result in costly redesign efforts, discontinuance of certain product and service offerings or other competitive harm. The Group has received, and may receive in the future, claims of infringement or misappropriation of other parties’ proprietary rights, particularly creative rights with respect to broadcasted programs. In addition to claims relating to broadcasts on channels which the Group owns, it may be subject to intellectual property infringement claims with respect to programs broadcast on the other channels, including foreign channels that it carries. Moreover, the telecommunications industry is characterized by a high concentration of intellectual property rights, which increases the risk of litigation resulting from our activities upon the grounds of prior rights of third parties. Therefore, the Group is particularly exposed to the risk of proceedings initiated by patent trolls. See “—The Group _may be subject to intellectual property infringement claims by “patent trolls”.”_ Any such claims may require the Group to initiate or defend protracted and costly litigation, regardless of the merits of these claims. Successful challenges to our rights to intellectual property or claims of infringement of a third party’s intellectual property could require the Group to enter into royalty or licensing agreements on unfavorable terms, incur substantial monetary liability or be temporarily or permanently prohibited from further use of the intellectual property in question. This could require the Group to change our business practices and limit the Group’s ability to provide our customers with the content that they expect. Even if we believe that the claims of intellectual property infringement are without merit, defending against the claims can be time consuming and costly and may divert management’s attention and resources away from our business. An inability on our part to effectively protect certain important elements of our intellectual property rights and of our technology could have a material adverse effect on our activities, financial position, results of operations or outlook.",,,,

16,Final Offerings 2020.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.3,Risks Relating to Legislative and Regulatory Matters,1.3.10,"The Group face risks arising from the outcome of various legal, administrative and regulatory proceedings.","In the ordinary course of business, we become party to litigation and other legal proceedings, including administrative and regulatory proceedings, and may be subjected to investigations and audits. Some of the proceedings against us may involve claims for considerable amounts and may require that our general management devote time to addressing such issues, to the detriment of managing the business. In addition, such proceedings may result in substantial damages and/or may impair our reputation, which may result in a decline in the demand for our services which could have a material adverse effect on our business. The outcome of these proceedings and claims could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, our results of operations or our cash flows during the years when such disputes are decided or the sums potentially involved in them are paid. The Group may also be exposed to proceedings that could involve our independent distributor partners, as well as other telecommunications operators which are so exposed. The Group is currently involved in number of disputes and proceedings referred to in “Business of the Group— _Legal Proceedings”. The costs that may result from these lawsuits are only accrued when it is more likely than_ not that a liability, resulting from past events, will be incurred and the amount of that liability can be quantified or estimated within a reasonable range. The amount of the provisions recorded in the Unaudited Financial Statements of the Group as of June 30, 2020 in respect of lawsuits amounted to €85 million in the aggregate, based on a case by case assessment of the risk level of each individual lawsuit, and events arising during the course of legal proceedings may require a reassessment of this risk. The Group’s assessment of risk is based both on the advice of legal counsel and on our estimate of the probable settlement amounts that are expected to be incurred, ----- if such a settlement would be agreed by both parties.

Such broad rights (such as in the GNU General Public Licence) are usually subject to the requirement that users not place any additional restrictions on access to the source code in any onward distribution of the software, and that such onward licensing be on the original licence terms. OSS is commonly viewed as having two major risks. First, the OSS licence usually also covers onward distributions of derivative works (based on the original OSS), with the result that proprietary software integrated with the OSS becomes “infected” and the entire integrated software program (OSS and proprietary software components) is covered by the OSS licence. One notable result of this is that the publisher or distributor of the derivative work would have to make available the source code of the entire work, including the proprietary software portions. The second commonly viewed risk is that OSS software is usually licenced “as is” without any contractual warranties. As a result, the Group would bear the risks in the event of defects with any OSS that the Group utilizes in its products and services without necessarily having any contractual recourse. Further, if the Group integrates OSS into any of the software that it publishes or distributes, then the use by the Group of OSS could have an impact on the ownership of the intellectual property in such software, particularly in terms of exclusivity, as the refusal to disclose any modifications made could be characterized as an infringement of the OSS licence. Moreover, the Group cannot rule out any risk of a request for disclosure or the request by a third party to access the modifications of the source code performed on such software. This situation could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial position, results of operations or outlook.",,,,

As a result, the Group may face increases in taxes payable if tax rates increase, or if tax laws and regulations are modified by the competent authorities in an adverse manner. In addition, the tax authorities in France periodically examine our activities. Any change in local or international tax rules, for example prompted by the implementation of the OECD’s recommendations on Base Erosion and Profits Shifting (a global initiative to improve the fairness and integrity of tax systems), or new challenges by tax authorities, may have an adverse effect on the Group’s tax positions and its financial results. Any changes may also affect the return on an investors’ investment in the Group and result in changes in personal tax rates and tax relief. The Group has structured its commercial and financial activities in compliance with various regulatory obligations to which it is subject, as well as in line with our commercial and financial objectives. Significant judgment is required in determining our tax positions, including, amongst others, corporate income tax and value added tax (“VAT”). In the ordinary course of business, there are transactions where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. To the extent that the laws and regulations of the various countries in which our companies are located or operate do not establish clear or definitive provisions, the tax treatment applied to our activities or our intra ----- group reorganizations is sometimes based on interpretations of the applicable tax regulations. The Group cannot guarantee that such interpretations will not be called into question by the competent tax administrations, which could have a material adverse effect on the financial position or results of our operations More generally, any breach of the tax regulations and laws of the countries in which our companies are located or operate could result in adjustments or the payment of late fees, fines or penalties. The French tax authorities have reassessed the application of VAT rates on certain multi-play offerings for fiscal years 2011 to 2016. The Group is disputing all of the proposed reassessments and has initiated appeals and dispute proceedings, which are at different stages for each of the years subject to reassessments. For more details, see “Business of the Group—Legal Proceedings— _Tax Audits”._ In addition, tax laws and regulations could change and could be subject to changes in their interpretation and in the application thereof. In particular, in the current macroeconomic environment, governmental authorities could decide to increase tax rates, to eliminate existing tax exemptions, to expand tax bases, or to introduce new taxes. As a result, we could undergo an increase in our tax burden if tax rates rise or if legislation or the interpretation thereof by the administration changes. In particular, the Group is exposed to the risk of a further increase in the VAT (and / or sectorial taxes such as turnover taxes on electronic communications operators) and might not be able to pass along such increase, in full or in part, through subscription prices, and this would then have a negative impact on overall revenue. Furthermore, any such increase in subscription prices would expose the Group to a risk of an increased churn rate from of its existing subscribers and could limit the recruitment of new subscribers.

16,Final Offerings 2020.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.3,Risks Relating to Legislative and Regulatory Matters,1.3.15,"French tax rules could limit the ability of the Group to deduct interest for tax purposes, thus reducing the net cash position of the Group.","As a general rule, pursuant to Article 39,1-1° of the French Tax Code (Code général des impôts) (“FTC”), expenses incurred by a French company are deductible provided, among other conditions, that (i) they are incurred in its direct corporate interest and (ii) they correspond to actual and justified expenses. In this respect, French case law has developed the concept of “abnormal act of management”, according to which the expenses incurred by a French company in relation with transactions that are not aligned with its direct corporate interest are not tax deductible. Given the complex intragroup transactions within the Group, the risk that the French Tax Authorities might try to challenge the deductibility of interest expenses resulting from intragroup financings (e.g., interest expenses on an intragroup loan), considering that such transactions (i) are not performed in the direct corporate interest of the French company of the Group at the level of which these interest expenses are incurred or (ii) have not been set at arm’s length conditions, cannot be excluded. Under Article 39.1.3° of the FTC, the deduction of interest paid by a French company to lenders who are direct shareholders of such company but are not related parties to such company within the meaning of Article 39.12 of the FTC, is subject to the conditions that (i) the share capital of the borrowing company is fully paid-in and (ii) the interest rate on the corresponding loans does not exceed a rate equal to the annual average rate of floating rate loans granted by financial establishments for a minimum term of two years (1.32% with respect to fiscal years closed on December 31, 2019). By exception, pursuant to Article 212, I-(a) of the FTC, the deductibility of interest ----- paid on loans granted by a related party within the meaning of Article 39.12 of the FTC is deductible within the limit of the interest that would have resulted from the application of the maximum tax rate computed as per Article 39, 1-3° of the FTC, or, if higher, from the rate that the borrower could have obtained from independent financial establishments in similar conditions. Pursuant to Article 39.12 of the FTC, two entities will be regarded as related if (i) one of the entities holds directly or indirectly the majority of the other entity’s share capital or actually exercises the power of decision in that entity or (ii) both entities are placed under the conditions defined in (i) to the control of a same third entity. In both of the above mentioned cases of interest and deductibility limitation, non-deductible expenses might be recharacterized as constructive dividends pursuant to Article 109 et seq. of the FTC, which may be subject to the withholding tax set out under Article 119 bis, 2 of the FTC, at a rate of (i) 28% (such rate will be lowered to 26,5% for fiscal years beginning as from January 1, 2021 and to 25% for fiscal years beginning as from January 1, 2022 in order to be aligned on the French standard corporate income tax rate) for payments benefiting legal persons who are not French tax residents or (ii) 75% for payments made in non-cooperative jurisdictions within the meaning of Article 238-0 A of the FTC other than those mentioned in 2° of 2 bis of the same Article 238-0 A, subject in any case to the more favorable provisions of an applicable double tax treaty. The French Finance Law for 2020 introduced new Articles 205 B, 205 C and 205 D in the FTC in order to implement under French tax law the provisions of the Council Directive (EU) 2017/952 of May 29, 2017 (the “ATAD 2”) on hybrid mismatches. These new rules aim at challenging hybrid and residency mismatches (the “Hybrid Mismatch Rules”) and replace the former anti-hybrid limitation that was set out by Article 212 I, b) of the FTC (pursuant to which the deductibility of interest paid on loans granted by a related party – within the meaning of Article 39.12 of the FTC – was subject to the requirement that the lender was, for the current year and with respect to concerned interest, subject to an income tax in an amount which was at least equal to 25% of the corporate income tax determined under standard French tax rules). Most of the Hybrid Mismatch Rules apply as from fiscal years starting on or after January 1, 2020 (consequently, Article 212 I-b of the FTC has been repealed from January 1, 2020). In substance, hybrid mismatches may result from the difference in the CIT tax treatment of (i) financial instruments, (ii) entities or (iii) payment attribution rules between two countries. Such differences may result in either: i A deduction for tax purposes in one country (the payer’s jurisdiction) without corresponding inclusion in the other (the payee’s jurisdiction); or ii A deduction in both countries (i.e., in the jurisdiction in which the payment has its source and in the investor’s jurisdiction). The new Hybrid Mismatch Rules provide for neutralization mechanisms of these mismatches which broadly lead to either (i) a non-deduction of payments or (ii) an inclusion in the taxable income of these payments. In practice, the Hybrid Mismatch Rules may concern any type of expenditure (including financial expenses) but shall only apply if a mismatch outcome arises either (i) between associated enterprises or (ii) under a structured arrangement (i.e., an arrangement involving a hybrid mismatch where the mismatch outcome is priced into the terms of the arrangement or an arrangement that has been designed to produce a hybrid mismatch outcome). For the purposes of these rules, an associated enterprise is different from a related party within the meaning of Article 39.12 of the FTC and means: - an entity in which the taxpayer (i) holds directly or indirectly a participation in terms of voting rights or capital ownership of 50% or more or (ii) is entitled to receive 50% or more of the profits of that entity; - a person which (i) holds directly or indirectly a participation in terms of voting rights or capital ownership in a taxpayer of 50% or more or (ii) is entitled to receive 50% or more of the profits of the taxpayer; - a taxpayer in which a person, who holds directly or indirectly a participation of 50% or more of the taxpayer’s voting rights or capital, also holds an interest of 50% or more of the voting rights or capital; ----- - an entity that is part of the same consolidated group for financial accounting purposes as the taxpayer; An enterprise in which the taxpayer has a significant influence in the management or an enterprise that has a significant influence in the management of the taxpayer. Pursuant to Article 212 bis of the FTC, subject to certain exceptions and safeharbour clauses, net financial charges, which are defined as the portion of financial charges exceeding financial income, accrued by companies that are subject to French corporate income tax, without distinction between third-party debts and related-party debts are deductible from their taxable result only up to a maximum amount equal to the higher of: (i) €3 million (to be adjusted on a _prorata temporis basis for fiscal years which do no last twelve months) and (ii) 30% of the company’s result before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization adjusted for tax purposes (“Tax EBITDA”) generated in the same fiscal year (the “30% EBITDA Limitation”). By exception, subject to certain exceptions and safeharbour clauses, where the average amount of the relatedparty debts of a company within the meaning of Article 39.12 of the FTC during a fiscal year exceeds in respect of that fiscal year one and a half times the amount of its equity (fonds propres), net financial expenses borne by such company are deductible for a portion of their amount up to the higher of (i) 30% of its Tax EBITDA and (ii) €3 million multiplied by a ratio equal to (A) the average amount of non-related party debts increased by 1.5x the company’s equity (assessed either at the beginning or at the closing date of the fiscal year) divided by (B) the average amount of all sums borrowed by or made available to the company during said year. The balance of net financial expenses is deductible for a portion of their amount up to the highest of (i) 10% of its Tax EBITDA and (ii) €1 million multiplied by a ratio equal to (A) the average amount of related-party debt exceeding 1.5x the company’s equity (assessed either at the beginning or at the closing date of the fiscal year) divided by (B) the average amount of all sums borrowed by or made available to the company during said fiscal year Under Article 223 B bis of the FTC, the above mentioned limitations apply, mutatis mutandis, to companies that belong to French tax-consolidated groups with respect to amounts made available by lenders outside such group. Finally, pursuant to Article 223 B of the FTC (generally referred to as the “Amendement Charasse”), when the shares of a target company are purchased from a seller by a company controlled directly or indirectly by such seller (or placed under common control with the seller), and the target company and the acquiring company become members of the same French tax-consolidated group, a portion of the interest incurred by the French taxconsolidated group in respect of a fiscal year is considered as non-deductible and is therefore added back to the tax-consolidated income. This add-back of financial costs is applicable over a maximum period of nine fiscal years (including the acquisition’s fiscal year) unless the target company leaves the French tax consolidated group (other than as a result of a merger with a company of the tax group to which the acquiring company belongs). If the limitation applies, the amount to be added back for each fiscal year is computed as follows: Purchase price of the shares Non-deductible interest Interest expenses deducted from the tax = x expenses group’s taxable income Average amount of the tax group’s debts The above mentioned tax rules may limit the Group’s ability to deduct interest accrued on the Group’s indebtedness incurred in France and, as a consequence, may increase the Group’s tax burden, which could adversely affect the Group’s business, results of operations and financial condition and reduce the cash flow available to service the Group’s indebtedness.",,,,

This leads to regular changes in the Group’s organizational structure and operations, which requires the Group’s employees to be flexible in responding to such changes. This process requires mobilization and motivation of teams with the Group’s objectives. As a result, the Group’s business could be affected by deterioration in labor relations with its employees, staff representative bodies or unions. The Group’s ability to maintain good relations with our employees, staff representative bodies and unions is crucial to the success of our various projects. Therefore, we must continuously consult with staff representatives in order to ensure the success of our current and future projects, which may delay the completion of certain projects. Furthermore, projects may be poorly received by employees and lead to a deterioration in labor relations, which could, in turn, lead to declines in productivity and possible labor disputes (e.g., strikes, disruptions), which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, planned decisions may not be well received by employees and may lead to a deterioration of the social climate, causing decreases in productivity and potential social conflicts (work interruptions, disruptions, etc.).

As a result, the loss of the support of our founder and controlling shareholder (including the allocation of his time to any other business interests) or any of these key executives and employees could cause disruptions in our business operations, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any failure to apply the necessary managerial and operational resources to our growing business and any weaknesses in our operational and financial systems or managerial controls and procedures may impact the Group’s ability to produce reliable financial statements and may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In our business, we rely on sales forces and call center employees to interface with the major part of our customers. Their reliability is key, as is our relationship with employee representatives. Some of our employees currently belong to organized unions and works councils, and there can be no assurance that more employees will not form or join unions in the future. An increase in the number of our unionized employees could lead to an increased likelihood of strikes, work stoppages and other industrial actions. In addition, we also face the risk of strikes called by employees of our key suppliers of materials or services as well as our installation providers, which could result in interruptions in the performance of our services.

As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, Next Alt is the controlling ----- shareholder of Altice Europe, and Altice Europe (through its indirect subsidiaries) owns 100% share capital and voting rights in the Issuer. In the event of consummation of the Take-Private Transaction, Next Alt will be the sole shareholder of Altice Europe and consequently Altice Europe would no longer have public investors as minority shareholders. When business opportunities, or risks and risk allocation arise, the interests of Altice Europe (or its affiliates) or Next Alt may be different from, or in conflict with, the Group’s interests on a standalone basis. Altice Europe and Next Alt may allocate certain of their risks to the Issuer or the Group and the Issuer cannot assure you that Altice Europe or Next Alt will permit the Group to pursue certain business opportunities. As a result of its controlling position, Altice Europe or Next Alt has, directly or indirectly, the power, among other things, to affect the Group’s legal and capital structure and day-to-day operations, as well as the ability to elect and change the Group’s management and to approve any other changes to the Group’s strategy, structure and operations. A change of strategy or management adversely affecting the Group’s operations could indirectly have an adverse effect on the Issuer’s abilities to meet its obligations under the Notes. In addition, Altice Europe or Next Alt has, directly or indirectly, the power to control the Group’s ability to enter into any corporate transaction and prevent any transaction that requires the approval of shareholders, regardless of whether holders of the Notes believe that any such transactions are in their own best interests. For example, Altice Europe or Next Alt could exercise such power to cause us to incur additional indebtedness or sell certain material assets, in each case, so long as the Group’s debt instruments and the Intercreditor Agreement permit. The incurrence of additional indebtedness would increase the Group’s debt service obligations and the sale of certain assets could reduce the Group’s ability to generate revenues, each of which could adversely affect the holders of the Notes.

The Group may have to negotiate at length with unions and works councils, and may suffer strikes, labor conflicts, work stoppages and other labor action, and it may also encounter difficulties in attracting and keeping staff due to local or general strikes. Strikes and other labor action, as well as the negotiating of new collective bargaining agreements or wage negotiations, could disrupt our activities and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations. The Group is active in very competitive markets that are constantly evolving, thus requiring its constant adaptation to, anticipation and adoption of new operational practices and technologies to preserve its competitiveness and our efficiency. This entails regular changes in organizations, which requires adaptation on the part of the human resources involved. In particular, this process demands an ability to mobilize skills and motivate and orient teams toward our objectives. As a result, the Group’s activities may sometimes be affected by a deterioration of the labor relations with our employees, staff representative bodies or labor unions. In such instances, certain of the Group’s entities would have to consult their staff representative bodies, or will have to do so, in order to successfully execute the Group’s current and future projects, which is likely to slow down the performance of certain operations. The Group also faces the risk of strikes called by employees of our main suppliers of equipment or services, as well as our facility providers, the latter generally organized in regional unions, which could lead to interruptions in our services. The Group cannot guarantee that labor conflicts or difficulties in retaining our staff will not have a material adverse effect our business and, potentially, our results of operations and our financial position. The Group has undertaken a simplification of its organization and implemented certain operating synergies measures. This transformation plan involves numerous situations of internal mobility, which may result in employee dissatisfaction or loss of personnel.

The only significant assets of the Issuer on the Issue Date will consist of cash in its bank accounts and its shares in its direct subsidiaries and various intercompany loans to its subsidiaries. As such, the Issuer will be wholly dependent upon payments under such loans and other payments from members of the Group in order to service its debt obligations under the Notes to the extent it does not have cash to meet those obligations. The ability of members of the Group to make such payments will depend upon their cash flows and earnings which, in turn, will be affected by all of the factors discussed in these “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. Furthermore, the payment of dividends and the making, or repayment, of loans and advances to the Issuer by the Issuer’s subsidiaries are subject to various restrictions. The ability of any of the Issuer’s direct or indirect subsidiaries to make certain distributions may be limited by the laws of the relevant jurisdiction in which the subsidiaries are organized or located, including financial assistance rules, corporate benefit laws, requirements that dividends must be paid out of reserves available for distribution and other legal restrictions which, if violated, might require the recipient to refund unlawful payments. In some cases, receipt of such payments or advances may be subject to onerous tax consequences. Although the Indenture, the Existing Senior Secured Indentures, the Existing Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement and the Existing Term Loans Agreement limit the ability of the Issuer’s subsidiaries to enter into future consensual restrictions on their ability to pay dividends and make other payments to the Issuer or the Guarantors, there are significant qualifications and exceptions to these limitations. We cannot assure you that arrangements with the Issuer’s subsidiaries and the funding permitted by the agreements governing existing and future indebtedness of the Issuer’s subsidiaries will provide the Guarantors or the Issuer with sufficient dividends, distributions or loans to fund payments under their Notes Guarantees or the Notes when due.

The value of the Notes Collateral and the amount that may be received upon a sale of Notes Collateral will depend upon many factors including, among others, the condition of the Notes Collateral, the ability to sell the Notes ----- Collateral in an orderly sale, industry, market and economic conditions, whether the business is sold as a going concern, the availability of buyers and other factors. With respect to any shares of the Group’s subsidiaries pledged to secure the Notes and the Notes Guarantees, such shares may also have limited value in the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation, winding up or other similar proceedings in relation to the entity’s shares that have been pledged because all of the obligations of the entity whose shares have been pledged must first be satisfied, leaving little or no remaining assets in the pledged entity. As a result, the creditors secured by a pledge of the shares of these entities may not recover anything of value in the case of an enforcement sale. In addition, courts could limit recoverability with respect to the Notes Collateral if they deem a portion of the interest claim usurious in violation of applicable public policy. As a result, liquidating the Notes Collateral may not produce proceeds in an amount sufficient to pay any amounts due on the Notes. If the proceeds of Notes Collateral were not sufficient to repay amounts outstanding under the Notes, then holders of the Notes (to the extent not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the Notes Collateral) would only have an unsecured claim against the Issuer’s and Guarantors’ remaining assets. See “—It may be difficult to realize the value of the Notes Collateral securing the Notes.” No appraisal of the fair market value of the Notes Collateral has been made in connection with this offering of Notes. The book value of the Notes Collateral should not be relied on as a measure of realizable value for such assets. The value of the Notes Collateral could be impaired in the future as a result of changing economic and market conditions, the Group’s failure to successfully implement the Group’s business strategy, competition and other factors. The Notes Collateral may include intangible or other illiquid assets that by their nature may not have a readily ascertainable market value, whose value to other parties may be less than its value to the Group, or may not be readily saleable or, if saleable, there may be substantial delays in their liquidation. In addition, the value of the Notes Collateral may decrease because of obsolescence, impairment or certain casualty events. The Indenture, the Existing Senior Secured Indentures, the Existing Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement and the Existing Term Loans Agreement permit the granting of certain liens other than those in favor of the holders of the Notes on the Notes Collateral securing the Notes. To the extent that holders of other secured indebtedness or third parties enjoy such liens, including statutory liens, whether or not permitted by the Indenture, the Existing Senior Secured Indentures, the Existing Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement and the Existing Term Loans Agreement or the Notes Collateral Documents, such holders or third parties may have rights and remedies with respect to the Notes Collateral that, if exercised, could reduce the proceeds available to satisfy the Issuer’s obligations under the Notes and the obligations of the Guarantors under the Notes Guarantees, to the extent such Notes and Notes Guarantees are secured by such Notes Collateral. Moreover, if the Issuer issues additional Notes under the Indenture, holders of such additional Notes would benefit from the same Notes Collateral as the holders of the Notes being offered hereby, thereby diluting holders of Notes’ ability to benefit from the liens on the Notes Collateral securing their Notes. The Intercreditor Agreement provides for detailed enforcement mechanisms with respect to the Notes Collateral and any enforcement of the Notes Collateral will be subject in many cases to significant limitations under local law.

The Initial Purchasers have neither analyzed the effect of, nor participated in any negotiations relating to, such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections. The existence of any such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens, loss of legal perfection and other imperfections could adversely affect the value of the Notes Collateral, as well as the ability of the Security Agent to realize or foreclose on such Notes Collateral. Furthermore, the ranking of security interests can be affected by a variety of factors, including, among others, the timely satisfaction of perfection requirements, statutory liens or recharacterization under the laws of certain jurisdictions. The security interests of the Security Agent will be subject to practical problems generally associated with the realization of security interests over real or personal property such as the Notes Collateral. For example, the Security Agent may need to obtain the consent of a third party, including that of competent regulatory authorities or courts, to enforce a security interest. The Group cannot assure you that the Security Agent will be able to obtain any such consents. The Group also cannot assure you that the consents of any third parties will be given when required to facilitate a foreclosure on such assets. Accordingly, the Security Agent may not have the ability to foreclose upon those assets, and the value of the Notes Collateral may significantly decrease. ----- Furthermore, enforcement procedures and timing for obtaining judicial decisions in Luxembourg may be materially more complex and time consuming than in equivalent situations in jurisdictions with which investors may be more familiar. In addition, the Group’s business requires a variety of national and local permits and licenses. The continued operation of properties that comprise part of the Notes Collateral and that depend on the maintenance of such permits and licenses may be prohibited or restricted. The Group’s business is subject to regulations and permitting requirements and may be adversely affected if we are unable to comply with existing regulations or requirements or if changes in applicable regulations or requirements occur. In the event of foreclosure, the grant of permits and licenses may be revoked and the transfer of such permits and licenses may be prohibited or may require us to incur significant cost and expense. Furthermore, we cannot assure you that the applicable governmental authorities will consent to the transfer of all such permits. If the regulatory approvals required for such transfers are not obtained, are delayed or are economically prevented, the foreclosure may be delayed, a temporary or lasting shutdown of operations may result, and the value of the Notes Collateral may be significantly decreased.",,,,

The liens on the Notes Collateral may not be perfected with respect to the Notes and the Notes Guarantees, as the case may be, if the Security Agent is not able to or does not take the actions necessary to perfect or maintain the perfection of any such liens. Such failure may result in the invalidity of the relevant security interest in the Notes Collateral securing the Notes or the Notes Guarantees, as applicable, or adversely affect the priority of such security interest in favor of such debt against third parties, including a trustee in bankruptcy and other creditors who claim a security interest in the same Notes Collateral. In addition, applicable law may require that certain property and rights acquired after the grant of a general security interest can only be perfected at the time such property and rights are acquired and identified. There can be no assurance that the Security Agent will monitor, or that we will inform the Security Agent of, the future acquisition of property and rights that constitute Notes Collateral, and that all necessary action will be taken to properly perfect the security interest in such after acquired collateral. Neither the Security Agent nor the Trustee has any obligation to monitor the acquisition of additional property or rights that should constitute Notes Collateral or the perfection of, or to take steps to perfect, any security interest therein. Such failure may result in the loss of the security interest in the Notes Collateral or adversely affect the priority of the security interest in favor of the Notes and the Notes Guarantees against third parties including a trustee in bankruptcy and other creditors who may claim a secured interest in any part of the Notes Collateral. Additionally, the Indenture and the Notes Collateral Documents may require the Group to take a number of actions that might improve the perfection or priority of the liens of the Security Agent in the Notes Collateral. To the extent that the security interests created by the Notes Collateral Documents with respect to any Notes Collateral are not perfected, the Security Agent’s rights will be equal to the rights of general unsecured creditors in the event of a liquidation, foreclosure, bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceeding.",,,,

The ability of the Security Agent to enforce certain of the Notes Collateral may be restricted by local law.,"The security interests in the Notes Collateral will not be granted directly to the holders of Notes, but will be granted only in favor of the Security Agent. The Indenture will provide (along with the Intercreditor Agreement) that only the Security Agent has the right to enforce the respective security documents. As a consequence, holders of the Notes will not have direct security interests and will not be entitled to take enforcement action in respect of the Notes, except through the Trustee, who will (subject to the provisions of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement) provide instructions to the Security Agent in respect of the Notes Collateral. The ability of the Trustee to control enforcement of any such collateral is subject to significant limitations. See “Description of Other _Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement”._ ----- The appointment of a foreign security agent will be recognized under Luxembourg law, (i) to the extent that the designation is valid under the law governing such appointment and (ii) subject to possible restrictions, depending on the type of the security interests. Generally, according to article 2(4) of the Luxembourg Act dated August 5, 2005 concerning financial collateral arrangements, as amended, a security (financial collateral) may be provided in favor of a person acting on behalf of the collateral taker, a fiduciary or a trustee in order to secure the claims of third party beneficiaries, whether present or future, provided that these third party beneficiaries are determined or may be determined. Without prejudice to their obligations vis à vis third party beneficiaries of the security, persons acting on behalf of beneficiaries of the security, the fiduciary or the trustee benefit from the same rights as those of the direct beneficiaries of the security aimed at by such law. The respective security documents governing the Notes Collateral will be governed by the laws of a number of jurisdictions. Bankruptcy laws could prevent the Security Agent on behalf of the holders of the Notes from repossessing and disposing of the Notes Collateral upon the occurrence of an event of default if a bankruptcy proceeding is commenced by or against the relevant grantor, before the Security Agent repossesses and disposes of such Notes Collateral to the extent applicable.

The granting of shared security interests to secure future permitted debt may restart or reopen such hardening or voidance periods in particular, because the Indenture will permit the release and retaking of security granted in favor of the Notes in certain circumstances, including in connection with the incurrence of future debt. The applicable hardening or voidance period for these new security interests can run from the moment each new security interest has been granted or perfected. At each such time, if the security interest granted or recreated were to be enforced before the end of the respective hardening or voidance period applicable in such jurisdiction, it may be declared void or ineffective and/or it may not be possible to enforce it.

The Notes will be guaranteed as from the Issue Date by the Guarantors, which are incorporated under the laws of France, Luxembourg and the United States. In the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency or similar event, proceedings could be initiated in any, all or any combination of the above jurisdictions. Such jurisdictions may not be as favorable to investors as the laws of the United States or other jurisdictions with which investors are familiar, and proceedings in these jurisdictions are likely to be complex and costly for creditors and otherwise may result in greater uncertainty and delay regarding the enforcement of your rights. Your rights under the Notes, the Notes Guarantees and the Notes Collateral will be subject to such bankruptcy, insolvency and administrative laws and there can be no assurance that you will be able to effectively enforce your rights in such complex, multiple bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceedings. See “—Each Notes Guarantee will be subject to certain limitations _on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability”._ In particular, French bankruptcy laws and regulations are unfavorable to creditors in many respects. Applicable fraudulent transfer and conveyance principles, insolvency laws and limitations on the enforceability of judgments obtained in France could limit the enforceability of the Notes, of the Notes Guarantees or of the security interests over the Notes Collateral. The insolvency court may also in certain circumstances void the security interests if insolvency proceedings have been commenced against a company incorporated in France. For a brief description of certain aspects of insolvency laws in France, see “Limitation on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes _Guarantees and the Security Interests and Insolvency Laws of Certain Jurisdictions—France—French insolvency laws”._ In addition, in the event that the Issuer, the Guarantors and any future guarantor, if any, or any of the Group’s other subsidiaries experiences financial difficulty, the bankruptcy, insolvency, administrative and other laws of ----- the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ jurisdictions of organization and location of assets may be materially different from, or in conflict with, each other and those of the United States, including in the areas of rights of creditors, priority of governmental and other creditors, ability to obtain post-petition interest and duration of the proceedings. The application of these laws, or any conflict among them, could call into question whether the law of any particular jurisdiction should apply, and may adversely affect the ability to enforce your rights under the Notes, the Notes Guarantees and the Notes Collateral in those jurisdictions or limit any amounts that you may receive.

However, the Indenture will provide that such Notes Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that may be guaranteed by the relevant Guarantor without, among other things, rendering the relevant Notes Guarantee, as it relates to that Guarantor, voidable or otherwise ineffective or limited under applicable law or causing the officers of the Guarantors to incur personal civil or criminal liability, and enforcement of each such Notes Guarantee would be subject to certain generally available defenses. See “Limitation on Validity and Enforceability of the _Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests and Insolvency Laws of Certain Jurisdictions”._ Enforcement of any of the Notes Guarantees against any Guarantor, or of the security interests in respect thereof will be subject to certain defenses available to Guarantors (including the Issuer) in the relevant jurisdiction. Although laws differ among various jurisdictions, in general, under bankruptcy or insolvency law and other laws, a court could (i) void or invalidate all or a portion of a Guarantor’s obligations under its Notes Guarantee or the security interests in respect thereof, (ii) direct that the holders of the Notes return any amounts paid under a Notes Guarantee to the relevant Guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of the Guarantor’s creditors or (iii) take other action that is detrimental to you, typically if the court found that: - the relevant Notes Guarantee was incurred with actual intent to give preference to one creditor over another, hinder, delay or defraud creditors or shareholders of the relevant Guarantor or, in certain jurisdictions, when the granting of the Notes Guarantee has the effect of giving a creditor a preference or when the recipient was aware that the relevant Guarantor was insolvent when it granted the relevant Notes Guarantee; - the relevant Guarantor did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value or corporate benefit for the relevant Notes Guarantee and such Guarantor was: (i) insolvent or rendered insolvent because of the relevant Notes Guarantee; (ii) undercapitalized or became undercapitalized because of the relevant Notes Guarantee; or (iii) intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, indebtedness beyond its ability to pay at maturity; - the relevant Notes Guarantee was held to exceed or breach financial assistance rules or the corporate objects of the Guarantors or not to be in the best interests or for the corporate benefit of the Guarantors; or - the amount paid or payable under the relevant Notes Guarantee was in excess of the maximum amount permitted under applicable law. These or similar laws may also apply to any future guarantee granted by any of the Group’s subsidiaries pursuant to the Indenture. Limitations on the enforceability of judgments obtained in New York courts in such jurisdictions could limit the enforceability of the Notes Guarantee against the Guarantor. We cannot assure you which standard a court would apply in determining whether a Guarantor was “insolvent” at the relevant time or that, regardless of the method of the valuation, a court would not determine that a Guarantor was insolvent on that date, or that a court would not determine, regardless of whether or not a Guarantor was insolvent on the date its Notes Guarantee was issued, that payments for the benefit of holders of the Notes constituted preferences, fraudulent transfers or conveyances on other grounds. The measures of insolvency for purposes of fraudulent transfer laws vary depending upon applicable governing law. Generally, an entity would be considered insolvent if, at the time it incurred indebtedness: ----- - the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, is greater than the fair value of all its assets; - the present fair saleable value of its assets is less than the amount required to pay the probable liability on its existing debts and liabilities, including contingent liabilities, as they become due; or - it cannot pay with its available assets its debts as they become due. The liability of each Guarantor under its Notes Guarantee will be contractually limited to the amount that will result in such Notes Guarantee not constituting a preference, fraudulent conveyance or improper corporate distribution or otherwise being set aside. However, there can be no assurance as to what standard a court will apply in making a determination of the maximum liability of each Guarantor. There is a possibility that the entire Notes Guarantee may be set aside, in which case the entire liability may be extinguished. If a court decided that a Notes Guarantee was a preference, fraudulent transfer or conveyance and voided such Notes Guarantee, or held it unenforceable for any other reason, you or the Security Agent for your benefit may cease to have any claim in respect of the relevant Guarantor and would be a creditor solely of the Issuer and, if applicable, of any other Guarantor under the relevant Notes Guarantee that has not been declared void. In the event that any Notes Guarantee is invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, or to the extent the agreed limitation of the Guarantee obligations apply, the Notes would be effectively subordinated to all liabilities of the applicable Guarantor, and if the Issuer cannot satisfy its obligations under the Notes or any Notes Guarantee is found to be a preference, fraudulent transfer or conveyance or is otherwise set aside, you may not be repaid in full amounts outstanding under the Notes.

If a change of control triggering event were to occur, there can be no assurances that the Issuer would have sufficient funds available at such time to pay such purchase price or that the restrictions in agreements and instruments governing the Group’s debt would allow such Issuer to make such required repurchases. Additionally, under the Existing Revolving Credit Facilities a change of control triggering event (as defined therein) constitutes a mandatory prepayment event and an automatic cancellation of the facilities thereunder and under the Existing Term Loans a change of control triggering event (as defined therein) constitutes an event of default permitting the lenders to accelerate the maturity of borrowings under the Existing Term Loans Agreement and the commitments thereunder to lend would terminate. The Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the holders of the Notes, and its other indebtedness following the occurrence of a change of control triggering event may be limited by the Group’s then existing financial resources. Sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. Furthermore, the Issuer’s ability to repurchase the Notes may be limited by law. If an event constituting a change of control triggering event occurs at a time when any of the Issuer is prohibited from repurchasing the Notes, under the agreements and instruments governing the Group’s debt, the Issuer may be required to seek the consent of the creditors under such indebtedness to purchase the Notes or may attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If we do not obtain such consent or refinance such borrowings, we will remain prohibited from any such repurchases. In addition, we expect that we would require third party financing to make an offer to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control triggering event, as set forth in the Indenture. The Group cannot assure you that it would be able to obtain such financing. Any failure by the Issuer to offer to purchase Notes would constitute a default under the Indenture, which could, in turn, constitute a default under other agreements governing the Group’s debt. See “Description of Notes—Change of Control”. The change of control triggering event provisions contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection in the event of certain important corporate events, including reorganizations, restructurings, mergers, recapitalizations or other similar transaction involving us that may adversely affect you, because such corporate events may not involve a shift in voting power or beneficial ownership or, even if they do, may not constitute a “change of control triggering event” as defined in the Indenture. Except as described under “Description of _Notes—Change of Control”, the Indenture will not contain provisions requiring the Group to offer to make_ ----- repurchases or redemptions, in the event of a reorganization, restructuring, merger, recapitalization or similar transaction. The definition of “change of control” to be contained in the Indenture includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer, and its restricted subsidiaries taken as whole to any person other than certain permitted holders. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all”, there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries taken as a whole. In addition, holders of the Notes may not be entitled to require the Issuer to purchase its Notes in certain circumstances involving a significant change in the composition of Altice Europe’s board of directors, including in connection with a proxy contest, where Altice Europe’s board of directors initially publicly opposes the election of a dissident slate of directors, but subsequently approves such directors for the purposes of the Indenture. This may result in a change in the composition of the board of directors that, but for such subsequent approval, would have otherwise constituted a change of control requiring a repurchase offer under the terms of the Indenture. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a change of control has occurred and whether the Issuer is required to make an offer to repurchase its Notes.",,,,

The EU FTT could, if introduced in its current draft form, apply, under certain circumstances, to some transactions involving the Notes and to persons both established within and outside the Participating Member States. The EU FTT proposal remains subject to negotiations between the Participating Member States, the scope of such tax being therefore uncertain. The timing of its implementation remains also unclear. Additional Member States may decide to participate and certain of the Participating Member States may decide to withdraw.

The overall impact on our business, operating results, cash flows and/or financial condition could be material.","In December 2019, a novel coronavirus disease was reported and in January 2020, the WHO declared COVID-19 a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. On February 28, 2020, the WHO raised its assessment of the COVID-19 threat from high to very high at a global level due to the continued increase in the number of cases and affected countries, and on March 11, 2020, the WHO characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected global economies, financial markets and the overall environment in which we do business, and the extent to which it may impact our future results of operations and overall financial performance remains uncertain. For a discussion of the impact the COVID-19 pandemic had on our business, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Quarterly Reports, which are incorporated by reference herein. In addition, the scale and scope of the COVID-19 pandemic may heighten the potential adverse effects on our business, operating results, cash flows and/or financial condition described in the risk factors contained in our Annual Report, including the impact of: - Significant interruptions in the operations of our manufacturing or distribution centers and logistics providers for the reasons described below; - Global and regional economic and political conditions on our production, supply chain, the overall demand for our products and the ability of our customers to purchase and/or pay for our products as a result of the pandemic’s impact on them; Our ability to develop and produce new products and services in an effort to address medical and other requirements as a result of the pandemic; - Changes in laws, regulations and regulatory requirements; - Limitations on our ability to enforce legal rights and remedies with third parties or partners outside the United States; - The risk of regulatory enforcement actions, product defects or claims thereof; - Our ability to pursue our growth strategies; - Our ability to pursue strategic acquisitions; - Changes within the industries that we serve; ----- - Our ability to access raw materials for use in the products we manufacture; and - The potential loss of customers or a reduction in orders from a significant number of customers. In addition, COVID-19 is adversely affecting, and is expected to continue to adversely affect, certain elements of our business (including certain elements of our operations, supply chains and distribution systems) as a result of impacts associated with preventive and precautionary measures that we, other businesses, our communities and governments are taking. In an effort to halt the outbreak of COVID-19, countries throughout the world, including the United States, most European Union member states, the United Kingdom, India and China, have placed significant restrictions on travel and many businesses have announced extended closures. These restrictions extend to a number of locations where we have significant operations and include shelter in place or stay-at-home orders that require our employees in that area to work from home and avoid unnecessary travel. In addition to existing travel restrictions, jurisdictions may continue to close borders, impose prolonged quarantines and further restrict travel and business activity, which could significantly impact our ability to support our operations and customers, the ability of our employees to get to their workplaces to produce products and provide services and the availability of raw materials for production of our products, as well as significantly hamper our products from moving through the supply chain. Further, in connection with the global outbreak and spread of COVID-19 and in an effort to increase the wider availability of needed medical and other supplies and products, we may elect to, or governments may require us to, allocate our products (for example pursuant to the U.S. Defense Production Act) in a way that adversely affects our regular operations and financial results, results in differential treatment of customers and/or adversely affects our reputation and customer relationships. In addition, unpredictable increases in demand for certain of our products could exceed our capacity to meet such demand, which could adversely affect our financial results and customer relationships and result in negative publicity. The duration and extent of the impact from the COVID-19 pandemic depends on future developments that cannot be accurately predicted at this time, such as the severity and transmission rate of the virus, the extent and effectiveness of containment actions and the impact of these and other factors on our employees, customers, suppliers and partners. Such impact on our business, operating results, cash flows and/or financial condition could be material.",,,,
25_1,Offerings 2020.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.1,Risks Related to Our Indebtedness and the Notes,1.1.2,"The Issuer has a substantial amount of indebtedness which could adversely affect the Issuer’s financial condition, and prevent the Issuer from fulfilling its obligations under the notes. In addition, the value of the rights of holders of the notes to the Collateral (as defined herein) may be reduced by any increase in the indebtedness secured by the Collateral.","After completion of this offering, the Issuer will have a substantial amount of indebtedness, which requires us to make significant interest and principal payments. On an as-adjusted basis after giving effect to the Refinancing Transactions, the Issuer and the Issuer’s subsidiaries would have had approximately $5,108.4 million of indebtedness as of September 30, 2020, including the notes offered hereby, and estimated cash interest for the twelve months ended September 30, 2020 would have been approximately $182.4 million. On an as-adjusted basis after giving effect to the Refinancing Transactions, the Issuer would also have had an additional $515.0 million available for borrowing under the Revolver (excluding issued but undrawn letters of credit) and an additional $260.0 million would have been available for borrowing under the A/R Facility. The Issuer’s substantial level of indebtedness could have important consequences to us and to the holders of the notes, including the following: - making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the notes and or other debt; - exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates as certain of our borrowings, including borrowings under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, are at variable rates of interest, which could further adversely impact our cash flows; ----- - restricting us from making strategic acquisitions or causing us to make non-strategic divestitures; - requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, which would reduce the funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, investments, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes; - limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business, future business opportunities and the industry in which we operate; - placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to any of our less leveraged competitors; - increasing our vulnerability to a downturn in our business and both general and industry-specific adverse economic conditions; and - limiting our ability to obtain additional financing at a favorable cost of borrowing, or at all, or to dispose of assets to raise funds, to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, investments, acquisitions or other general corporate requirements. The Issuer and the Issuer’s subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, subject to the restrictions contained in the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the indenture that governs the Existing Unsecured Notes and the indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby. To the extent the Issuer and the Issuer’s subsidiaries incur further indebtedness, the substantial risks related to the Issuer’s level of indebtedness would increase. If the Issuer incurs any additional indebtedness that ranks equally with the notes, the holders of that debt will be entitled to share ratably with such holders in any proceeds distributed in connection with any insolvency, liquidation, reorganization, dissolution or other winding up of the company, subject to any collateral arrangements. This may have the effect of reducing the amount of proceeds paid to you. To the extent the Issuer and the Issuer’s subsidiaries incur further indebtedness, the substantial risks related to the Issuer’s level of indebtedness would increase. See “Description of Notes.” The Issuer’s ability to meet expenses, to remain in compliance with its covenants under such debt instruments and to make future principal and interest payments in respect of the Issuer’s debt depends on, among other things, the Issuer’s operating performance, competitive developments and financial market conditions, all of which are significantly affected by financial, business, economic and other factors. The Issuer is not able to control many of these factors. Given current industry and economic conditions, the Issuer’s cash flow may not be sufficient to allow the Issuer to pay principal and interest on its debt, including the notes, the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, and the Existing Unsecured Notes, and meet its other obligations.",,,,
25_1,Offerings 2020.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.1,Risks Related to Our Indebtedness and the Notes,1.1.3,"Due to many factors beyond the Issuer’s control, including as a result of the impact of COVID-19, the Issuer may not have sufficient cash flows from operating activities to service all of the Issuer’s indebtedness, including the notes, the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the Existing Unsecured Notes, and meet the Issuer’s other ongoing liquidity needs, and it may be forced to take other actions to satisfy the Issuer’s obligations under its debt agreements, which may not be successful.","The Issuer’s ability to make payments on and to refinance its indebtedness, including the notes, the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the Existing Unsecured Notes, will depend on its ability to generate cash in the future. The Issuer’s ability to generate cash will be subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors, some of which are beyond the Issuer’s control, such as the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Issuer’s future cash flow, cash on hand or available borrowings may not be sufficient to meet such obligations and commitments. If the Issuer is unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service its indebtedness and to meet its other commitments, the Issuer will be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as refinancing or restructuring the Issuer’s indebtedness (including the notes), selling material assets or operations or seeking to raise additional debt or equity capital. These actions may not be effected on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms or at all, or these actions may not enable us to continue to satisfy the Issuer’s capital requirements. In addition, the Issuer’s existing or future debt agreements contain and will contain restrictive covenants that may prohibit us from adopting any of these alternatives. The Issuer’s failure to comply ----- with these covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all its debts. See “Description of Notes.” In addition, the Issuer conducts substantially all of its operations through its subsidiaries, certain of which will not be issuers or guarantors of the notes or its other indebtedness. Accordingly, repayment of such indebtedness, including the notes, will be dependent in part on the generation of cash flow by its subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us, by dividend, debt repayment or otherwise. Unless they are guarantors of the notes, the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the Existing Unsecured Notes or such other indebtedness, the subsidiaries will not have any obligation to pay amounts due on the notes, the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the Existing Unsecured Notes or such other indebtedness, as applicable, or to make funds available for that purpose. The Issuer’s subsidiaries may not be able to, or may not be permitted to, make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of the Issuer’s indebtedness, including the notes. Each subsidiary is a distinct legal entity, and under certain circumstances legal and contractual restrictions may limit the Issuer’s ability to obtain cash from the Issuer’s subsidiaries. While the indenture that governs the Existing Unsecured Notes, the credit agreement that governs the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the agreements governing certain of our other indebtedness limit, and the indenture that will govern the notes will limit, the ability of certain of the Issuer’s subsidiaries to incur consensual restrictions on their ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany payments to the Issuer, these limitations are, in the case of our existing debt, and will be, in the case of the notes offered hereby, subject to certain qualifications and exceptions. In the event that the Issuer does not receive distributions from its subsidiaries, the Issuer may be unable to make the required principal and interest payments on the Issuer’s indebtedness, including the notes. If the Issuer cannot make scheduled payments on its debt, the Issuer will be in default, and as a result, holders of the notes and certain of its other indebtedness could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable, the lenders under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities could foreclose against the assets securing the borrowings under such agreements and the Issuer could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation, which, in each case, could result in your losing all or a portion of your investment in the notes.",,,,
25_1,Offerings 2020.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.1,Risks Related to Our Indebtedness and the Notes,1.1.4,A significant portion of our net sales and assets are derived from entities that will not be guarantors of the notes. The notes and the guarantees will be structurally subordinated to all liabilities of the Issuer’s non-guarantor subsidiaries.,"From and after the consummation of this offering, the notes offered hereby will be guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by Holdings and all of Holdings’ existing and future domestic subsidiaries to the extent each such subsidiary guarantees the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. However, the guarantee of the notes by a subsidiary will be automatically released under certain circumstances. See “Description of Notes—Guarantees.” In addition, the indenture that governs the Existing Unsecured Notes permits, and the indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby will permit, the Issuer’s subsidiaries, including the Issuer’s non-guarantor subsidiaries, to incur certain additional indebtedness, and will not limit their ability to incur trade payables and similar liabilities that are not considered indebtedness thereunder. You will not have any claim as a creditor against any of the Issuer’s non-guarantor subsidiaries. Furthermore, in the event that any non-guarantor subsidiary becomes insolvent or is liquidated, reorganized or dissolved, the assets of such non-guarantor subsidiary will be used first to satisfy the claims of its creditors, including trade creditors, banks and other lenders, followed by claims of any holders of preferred stock of such nonguarantor subsidiary. Only the residual equity value will be available to us and the Issuer’s guarantors, and only to the extent the Issuer or any guarantor is a parent company of such non-guarantor subsidiary. Consequently, each guarantee of the notes will be structurally subordinated to claims of creditors of non-guarantor subsidiaries. In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation or dissolution of any non-guarantor subsidiaries, holders of their debt, including their trade creditors, secured creditors and creditors holding indebtedness or guarantees issued by those subsidiaries, are generally entitled to payment on their claims from assets of those subsidiaries before any assets are made available for distribution to us. Excluding the effect of intercompany balances as well as intercompany transactions, after giving effect to the Refinancing Transactions, the non-guarantor subsidiaries of the Issuer accounted for approximately $2,719.6 ----- million, or 44%, of its net sales for the twelve months ended September 30, 2020, and approximately $5,691.7 million, or 57%, of its total assets as of September 30, 2020, and would have accounted for approximately $57.4 million, or 1.1%, of its total gross indebtedness including capital lease obligations as of September 30, 2020.",,,,
25_1,Offerings 2020.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.1,Risks Related to Our Indebtedness and the Notes,1.1.5,"There are circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the notes under which the guarantees will be released automatically, without your consent or the consent of the trustee.","Under various circumstances, the guarantees of the notes will be released automatically. The guarantee of a guarantor of the notes will be automatically released to the extent such guarantor is released in connection with a sale or other disposition of the equity interests of such guarantor in a transaction not prohibited by the indenture that will govern the notes. The indenture also will permit us to designate one or more of the Issuer’s restricted subsidiaries that is a guarantor of the notes as an unrestricted subsidiary, which will result in the guarantee of such guarantor being automatically released. If a guarantor is released from its guarantee of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and certain other indebtedness of the Issuer or any other guarantor, other than in connection with a refinancing of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and such other indebtedness or a payment under such guarantee, or a guarantor ceases to be a subsidiary as a result of any foreclosure of any pledge or security interest securing the secured indebtedness, such subsidiary’s guarantee of the notes will be automatically released as well, in which case any liens on the assets of such subsidiary in favor of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the notes offered hereby will also be released. If the guarantee of any guarantor is released, no holder of the notes will have a claim as a creditor against that subsidiary, and the indebtedness and other liabilities, including trade payables and preferred stock, if any, whether secured or unsecured, of that subsidiary will be structurally senior to the claim of any holders of the notes. For a description of all circumstances in which a guarantor’s subsidiary guarantee will be automatically released, see “Description of Notes—Guarantees.”",,,,

See “Description of Notes—Release of Collateral”; - with respect to Collateral held by a guarantor of the notes, upon the release of such guarantor from its guarantees; and - if the Issuer or the notes are rated investment grade by any two of the three rating agencies. See “Description of Notes—Covenant Suspension.” The indenture that will govern the notes will also permit us to designate one or more of the Issuer’s restricted subsidiaries that is a guarantor of the notes as an unrestricted subsidiary. If the Issuer designates a subsidiary guarantor as an unrestricted subsidiary for purposes of the indenture that will govern the notes, all of the liens on any Collateral owned by that subsidiary or any of its subsidiaries and any guarantees of the notes by that subsidiary or any of its subsidiaries will be released under the indenture that will govern the notes. Designation of an unrestricted subsidiary will reduce the aggregate value of the Collateral securing the notes to the extent that liens on the assets of the unrestricted subsidiary and its subsidiaries are released. In addition, the creditors of any such unrestricted subsidiary and its subsidiaries will have a claim on the assets of the unrestricted subsidiary and its subsidiaries senior to the claim of the holders of the notes.",,,,

Any pledge of collateral in favor of the collateral agent for the notes and the other security documents delivered after the Reversion Date, could be avoidable in bankruptcy and if this were to occur, you could lose the benefit of such security interest.

See “Description of Notes—Guarantees.” The lenders under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities will have the discretion to release the guarantees under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities in a variety of circumstances.

The agreements governing the Issuer’s indebtedness restrict or will restrict, subject to certain exceptions, the Issuer’s ability and the ability of the Issuer’s restricted subsidiaries to, among other things: - incur additional indebtedness and guarantee indebtedness; - pay dividends or make other distributions in respect of, or repurchase or redeem, capital stock; - prepay, redeem or repurchase certain debt; - make loans and investments; - sell or otherwise dispose of assets; - sell stock of the Issuer’s subsidiaries; - create or incur liens; - enter into certain transactions with affiliates; - enter into agreements restricting the Issuer’s and the Issuer’s subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends or to incur liens on assets; ----- - enter into amendments to certain subordinated indebtedness in a manner materially adverse to the lenders; and - consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of the Issuer’s assets. In addition, any future financing arrangements entered into by us may contain similar restrictions. As a result of these covenants and restrictions, the Issuer is and will be limited in how the Issuer conducts its business, and the Issuer may be unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities. In addition, the Issuer will be required to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy other financial condition tests. The terms of any future indebtedness the Issuer may incur could include more restrictive covenants. The Issuer cannot assure you that it will be able to maintain compliance with these covenants in the future and, if the Issuer fails to do so, that the Issuer will be able to obtain waivers from the lenders and/or amend the covenants. Events beyond our control, including the impact of COVID-19, may affect our ability to comply with our covenants. The Issuer’s failure to comply with the restrictive covenants described above as well as others contained in the Issuer’s future debt instruments from time to time could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could result in the Issuer being required to repay these borrowings before their maturity. If the Issuer is forced to refinance these borrowings on less favorable terms or cannot refinance these borrowings, the Issuer’s results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.",,,,
25_1,Offerings 2020.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.1,Risks Related to Our Indebtedness and the Notes,1.1.10,"Federal and state statutes may allow courts, under specific circumstances, to avoid the notes, the guarantees relating to the notes, and the liens securing the notes and related guarantees, subordinate claims in respect of the notes, the guarantees and the liens securing the notes and related guarantees and/or require holders of the notes to return payments received from us in respect of the guarantees and the liens.","The incurrence of indebtedness evidenced by the notes, the guarantees and the grant of liens by the guarantors (including any future guarantees and future liens) may be subject to review and challenge under relevant state and federal fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer statutes in a bankruptcy or reorganization case or a lawsuit by or on behalf of the Issuer’s creditors outside of bankruptcy. Under these statutes, the notes, the guarantees and the grant of liens, could be avoided, or claims in respect of the notes, the guarantees and the liens could be subordinated to all of the Issuer’s other indebtedness, if a court were to find at the time the Issuer or such guarantor issued the notes, incurred a guarantee of the notes or granted the lien, as applicable, that the Issuer or the applicable guarantor received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for issuing the note, incurring the guarantee or granting the lien, and: - intended to hinder, delay or defraud any present or future creditor; - was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of the incurrence of such indebtedness; - was engaged in, or about to engage in, a business or transaction for which the Issuer’s or the guarantor’s remaining assets constituted unreasonably small capital; or - intended to incur, or believed that the Issuer or guarantor would incur, indebtedness beyond the Issuer’s or such guarantor’s ability to repay such debts as they mature. A court might also avoid the issuance of the notes, a guarantee or a lien, without regard to the above factors, if the court found that the Issuer issued the notes or the guarantors entered into the applicable guarantee or granted the liens with actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud the Issuer’s or the guarantors’ respective creditors. If a court were to avoid (x) the issuance of the notes or the guarantees, you would no longer have a claim against us or the guarantors or (y) in the case of the liens granted to secure the notes, you would no longer have a secured claim against us or the guarantors, as applicable. Sufficient funds to repay the notes may not be available from other sources, including the remaining guarantors, if any. If a note, guarantee or a lien is avoided as a fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer or found to be unenforceable for any reason, you will not have a claim against that ----- obligor and will only be a creditor of the Issuer or any guarantor to the extent the Issuer’s or such guarantor’s obligation is not set aside or found to be unenforceable. You may also be required to return payments you have received, as the court might direct you to repay any amounts that you already received from us or the guarantors with respect to such note, guarantees and liens. In addition, any payment by us pursuant to the notes or by a guarantor made at a time when the Issuer or such guarantor is subsequently found to be insolvent could be avoided and required to be returned to us or such guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of the Issuer’s or the guarantor’s creditors if such payment is made to an insider within a one-year period prior to a bankruptcy filing or within 90 days to any non-insider party and such payment would give the holders of notes more than such holders of notes would have received in a liquidation under Title 11 of the United States Code, as amended, or the “Bankruptcy Code.” As a general matter, value is given for a transfer or an obligation if, in exchange for the transfer or obligation, property is transferred or a valid antecedent debt is satisfied. A court would likely find that a guarantor did not receive reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for such guarantee and/or lien if such guarantor did not substantially benefit directly or indirectly from the issuance of the notes and/or such guarantee and/or lien. Thus, if the guarantees were legally challenged, any guarantee could be subject to the claim that, since the guarantee was incurred for the Issuer’s benefit, and only indirectly for the benefit of the guarantor, the obligations of the applicable guarantor were incurred for less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration. The measures of insolvency for purposes of these fraudulent conveyance or transfer and preferences laws will vary depending upon the law applied in any proceeding. Generally, however, the Issuer would be considered insolvent if: - the sum of the Issuer’s indebtedness, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the fair value of all the Issuer’s assets; - the present fair saleable value of the Issuer’s assets were less than the amount that would be required to pay the Issuer’s probable liability on existing indebtedness, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or - the Issuer could not pay the Issuer’s debts as they become due. The Issuer cannot assure you as to the standard a court would apply in making such determinations or that a court would agree with the Issuer’s conclusions in this regard that the Issuer and the guarantors will not be insolvent or rendered insolvent by the issuance of the notes and the guarantees. Regardless of the actual standard applied by the court, we cannot be certain that the issuance of the notes, a guarantee, or the granting of liens would not be avoided as a preference, fraudulent transfer, fraudulent conveyance, or otherwise, or that the issuance of the notes and the guarantees would not be subordinated to the Issuer’s or any guarantor’s other debt. The indentures that will govern the notes offered hereby will contain a “savings clause,” which limits the liability of each guarantor on its guarantee to the maximum amount that such guarantor can incur without risk that its guarantee will be subject to avoidance as a fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer. The Issuer cannot assure you such a savings clause limitation, as a legal matter will protect such guarantees from fraudulent conveyance or transfer challenges or, if it does, that the remaining amount due and collectible under the guarantees would suffice, if necessary, to pay the notes in full. Finally, as a court of equity, the bankruptcy court may subordinate the claims in respect of the notes to other claims against us under the principle of “equitable subordination”, if the court determines that: (1) the holders of the notes engaged in some type of inequitable conduct; (2) such inequitable conduct resulted in injury to the Issuer’s other creditors or conferred an unfair advantage upon the holder of the notes; and (3) equitable subordination is not inconsistent with the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code.",,,,
25_1,Offerings 2020.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.1,Risks Related to Our Indebtedness and the Notes,1.1.11,The Issuer may not be able to repurchase the notes upon a Change of Control required by the indenture that will govern the notes.,"Upon a Change of Control, as defined under the indenture that will govern the notes, you will have the right to require the Issuer to offer to purchase the notes then outstanding at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount ----- of such notes, plus accrued interest. In order to obtain sufficient funds to pay the purchase price of the outstanding notes, the Issuer may need to refinance the notes and/or the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. However, it is possible that the Issuer will not have sufficient funds at the time of the change of control to make the required repurchase of the notes. If the Issuer is required to repurchase the notes, the Issuer could require third-party financing. The Issuer cannot be sure that it would be able to obtain third-party financing on acceptable terms, or at all. The Issuer’s failure to offer to purchase all outstanding notes or to purchase all validly tendered notes would be an event of default under the indenture that will govern the notes. Such an event of default may cause the acceleration of the Issuer’s other debt, including debt under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. The Issuer’s future debt also may contain restrictions on repayment requirements with respect to specified events or transactions that constitute a change of control under the indenture that will govern the notes. The indenture governing the Existing Unsecured Notes also contains similar change of control offer provisions. The credit agreement governing our Senior Secured Credit Facilities also provide that a change of control is an event of default that permits lenders to accelerate the maturity of borrowings thereunder. Any of our future debt arrangements may contain similar provisions. If the Issuer is required to repurchase the notes pursuant to a change of control offer and repay certain amounts outstanding under such other indebtedness, the Issuer would probably require third-party financing. The Issuer cannot be sure that it would be able to obtain third-party financing on acceptable terms, or at all. If the indebtedness under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities is not paid, the lenders thereunder may seek to enforce security interests in the collateral, thereby limiting the Issuer’s ability to raise cash to purchase the notes, and reducing the practical benefit of the offer to purchase provisions to the holders of the notes.",,,,
