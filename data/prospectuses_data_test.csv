16,Final Offerings 2020.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.1,"Risks Relating to the Group’s Business, Technology and Competition",1.1.1,The Group faces significant competition in each of the industries in which the Group operates and competitive pressures could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business.,"The French telecommunications market is a mature market, marked by very active competition between the main operators and very strong pressure on prices. Despite growth in market size, the French telecommunications market has recently declined in value primarily due to price pressure in the mobile market following the arrival of a fourth player in 2012 and the decline in regulated call termination rates. The Group faces significant competition from established and more recent competitors and may face competition from new entrants and market concentrations in the future. While the nature and level of competition to which the Group is subject vary according to the products and services that it offers, in each case the Group generally competes on the basis of prices, marketing, products, network coverage, characteristics of services, and customer service. The main competitor of the Group in the residential and business services markets overall is Orange, the incumbent telecommunications operator in France, that has greater financial resources and owns a more extensive network than the Group’s and that is unlikely to be duplicated or matched by the Group in the near future. Bouygues Telecom Enterprises (“Bouygues Telecom”) and Iliad are the Group’s major competitors in the residential market. In the premium pay-TV market, Groupe Canal+ products are available throughout the French territory via satellite, cable, and DTT and DSL technologies. The Group’s main competitor in business services markets overall is Orange, the incumbent telecommunications operator in France. Orange has greater financial resources and owns a more extensive network than the Group which the Group is unlikely to duplicate or match in the near future. In the residential market, in addition to Orange and Bouygues Telecom, the Group also competes with international telecommunications operators such as Colt, Verizon, AT&T, and BT, which offer multinationals access to their international networks while the Group’s network is available only in France. The Group also has operations in the French Overseas Territories that face competition and competitive pressure risks similar to those described herein. The Group’s products and services are also subject to increasing competition from alternative new technologies or improvements in existing technologies. New players from sectors that are either unregulated or subject to different regulations (including internet players such as Yahoo!, Google, Disney+, Microsoft, Amazon, Apple, YouTube, Netflix and other audiovisual players, media players and “over the top” (“OTT”) (of an existing broadband internet network) players) have also emerged as competitors to the Group’s video content offering. These players are taking advantage of improved connectivity and platform agnostic technologies to offer OTT and cloud-based services. Telecommunications operators are expected to maintain traditional access services and billing relationships over which users access services from adjacent players such as well-known companies offering music, video, photos, apps and retail. The rapid success of audiovisual content streamed through the telecommunications network and insufficient innovation could lead to the emergence of other content or service providers as well as the saturation of the market, which would put pressure on the revenues and margins of operators like the Group, while simultaneously requiring them to increase capital expenditures to remain competitive, which could adversely affect the Group’s business, financial condition or results of operations. ----- Moreover, the Group is also facing competition from non-traditional mobile voice and data services based on new mobile internet technologies, in particular OTT applications, such as Skype, Google Talk, Facetime, Viber and WhatsApp. These OTT applications are often free of charge, accessible via smartphones and allow their users to have access to potentially unlimited messaging and voice services over the internet, thus bypassing more expensive traditional voice and messaging services, such as SMS and MMS, provided by mobile network operators, who are only able to charge the internet data usage for such services. All telecommunications operators are currently competing with OTT service providers who leverage existing infrastructures and operate capitallight business models, enhancing their ability to compete with businesses, such as the Group’s, which operate capital-intensive business models. OTT service providers have over the past years become more sophisticated and technological developments have led to a significant improvement in the quality of service, particularly in speech quality. In addition, players with strong brand capability and financial strength, such as Apple, Google and Microsoft, have turned their attention to the provision of OTT audio and data services. In the long term, if nontraditional mobile voice and data services or similar services continue to increase in popularity and if the Group, or more generally all of the telecommunications operators, are not able to address this competition, this could cause declines in subscriber base and profitability across all of the Group’s products and services, among other material adverse effects. In addition, the Group may face increasing competition from the large-scale roll-out of public Wifi networks by local governments and utilities and transportation service providers, new and existing Wifi telecommunications operators and others, which particularly benefits OTT service providers. Due to their ability to leverage existing infrastructure and to roll out public Wifi in a cost-efficient way, the Group’s competitors may be better positioned to offer their customers public Wifi access at attractive terms and conditions or as part of their current mobile and landline offerings, which may affect the Group’s ability to retain or acquire customers. Furthermore, the Group’s competitors may realize cost savings by off-loading mobile data traffic onto their own Wifi networks or those of their partners in order to reduce costs and increase bandwidth more quickly or efficiently than the Group can. An increase in public Wifi networks could also cause declines in profitability as demand for the Group’s network and services decreases. The following is an overview of the competitive landscape in France: _1. Residential—Mobile_ The Group competes with service providers that use alternative technologies for internet access, such as satellite technologies or mobile standards such as universal mobile telecommunications system (“UMTS”) and 3G/4G mobile technologies. These mobile broadband high speed internet access technologies may enable both incumbent and new broadband access providers to provide high bandwidth connection services for voice and data. Furthermore, additional access technologies may be launched in the future that will further increase competition or lead the Group to increase capital expenditure for additional upgrades. Providers of mobile broadband internet access may be able to offer fast internet access speeds at a competitive cost, with the additional possibility of allowing subscribers to access the internet remotely. The French mobile telephony market is characterized by competition among well-established mobile network operators such as Orange, Bouygues Telecom and Free and other operators without their own mobile networks. Competition has intensified, particularly as to price, since Free entered the market in early 2012 with a low-priced unlimited calling package. The mobile telephony market in France is currently undergoing a transformation because of competitive pricing, bundled packages no longer including subsidized handsets and the development of “low cost” brands. After strong price decreases in 2013 and 2014, which resulted in mobile post-paid prices in France being among the lowest in Europe, price pressure eased in 2015 and 2016 but intensified again in 2017, weakened slightly in 2018, increased again in 2019, and remained stable in 2020. If price pressure continues to intensify, the Group’s results of operations and financial condition in future periods may be materially adversely affected. _2. Residential—Fixed_ In the French pay-TV market, the Group competes with providers of premium television packages such as CanalSat, DSL triple-play and/or quadruple-play operators such as Orange, Free and Bouygues Telecom, which provide IPTV, and providers of pay DTT (such as Canal+, which operates across multiple formats: including IPTV, pay DTT, satellite and cable). The growth of IPTV, which is the most popular pay-TV distribution platform followed by satellite and DTT, has changed the market, opening up the provision of pay-TV services beyond the ----- traditional methods of cable and satellite, which is limited by the inability to install a satellite dish on the façade of buildings in certain areas, such as central Paris. The Group also competes with satellite television services that may be able to offer a greater range of channels to a larger audience, reaching wider geographic areas (especially in rural areas) for lower prices than the prices of the Group’s cable pay-TV services. Any increase in market share of satellite distribution may have a negative impact on the success of the Group’s digital cable television services. The Group also faces competition from satellite distribution of free to air television programming. While pay DTT’s share of the pay-TV market is currently low, providers of pay DTT may in the future be able to offer a wider range of channels to a larger audience for lower prices than the Group charges. In the broadband market, the Group provides high speed internet through its cable, FTTH and xDSL networks and it competes primarily with xDSL and FTTH providers, with FTTH currently being the most widespread technology used to access very high speed internet in France. Orange is the leading DSL provider in France, followed by Free, the Group and Bouygues Telecom. While the Group believes that it has the network advantage in terms of its fiber optic/cable network compared to its competitors’ xDSL networks, and better coverage of fiber networks as compared to its competitors, which currently places the Group at a competitive advantage to exploit the increased demand in France for very-high-speed internet in the areas covered by the Group’s fiber optic/cable network, such competitive advantage may be diminished to the extent that competitors increase the roll out their FTTH networks. For further information see “The deployment of fiber optic networks and/or VDSL2 by _competitors of the Group could reduce and ultimately eliminate the gap between the speed and the power of the fiber optic/cable network of the Group compared to the DSL networks of its main competitors.” In addition, the_ Group’s xDSL competitors’ networks cover more French households than the Group’s network and pricing is very competitive. _3. Business Services—B2B_ In the B2B segment the Group’s main competitors are Orange (Orange Business Services) and Colt. Bouygues Telecom is also a competitor in the SME segment. The French B2B market for voice services is extremely price sensitive, with sophisticated customers, relatively short term (typically one year) contracts, and vulnerability to cuts in mobile termination rates. The ability to compete effectively is partially a function of network capillarity, and certain of the Group’s competitors have a more extensive and denser network than us. In the data market, customers also often seek combined infrastructure and software solutions. As a result, the Group also competes with software and other IT providers of data and network solutions, which may decrease the value customers place on its infrastructure solutions, leading to a reduction in its prices and margins. IT providers may also partner with the Group’s infrastructure telecommunications competitors. _4. Business Services—Wholesale_ The French wholesale telecommunications market is dominated by Orange and the Group, although Orange’s and the Group’s market shares vary depending on the segment. The Group also faces competition from consortiums of telecommunications operators and construction companies, such as Covage, Vinci, Eiffage and Axiom (who may lay down fiber in construction sites and then lease them on the wholesale market). The wholesale market for data services in France is less volatile than the voice market. Competition is based primarily, in addition to price, on service quality and technological advancement. The wholesale market for dark fiber infrastructure in France is more open than for wholesale voice and data carriage, as providing it does not require having a dense, national network and does not include any services would require technical expertise. The Group expects competition in the French telecommunications industry to remain intense and there can be no assurance that the Group will not be negatively impacted by any future consolidation of the Group’s competitors or similar developments in one or more of the markets in which the Group competes. For further details regarding the competitive environment, in which we operate, see “Industry, Competition and Market Overview”.",,,,
16,Final Offerings 2020.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.1,"Risks Relating to the Group’s Business, Technology and Competition",1.1.2,The deployment of fiber optic networks and/or VDSL2 by competitors of the Group could reduce and ultimately eliminate the gap between the speed and the power of the fiber optic/cable network of the Group compared to the DSL networks of its main competitors.,"The Group believes that one of its major competitive advantages is the power and speed of its fiber optic/cable network. As of June 30, 2020, the Group’s network passed approximately 17,457,000 fiber/cable homes, including fiber/cable homes now passed by SFR FTTH. However, competitors of the Group are also deploying fiber and/or VDSL2 networks enabling download speeds and bandwidths that could rival those reached by the Group’s network, and thus strongly reduce the Group’s competitive advantage. The Group’s main competitors (Orange, ----- Free and Bouygues Telecom) have begun to introduce FTTH networks to increase and harmonize their network speed. On December 4, 2019, Orange unveiled its strategic plan through 2025 indicating its objectives for FTTH lines to include the deployment of approximately 19 million lines in private areas (compared to 10.4 million already rolled-out as of June 2019) and approximately 4 million lines in investment areas (compared to 0.4 million as of June 2019) in addition of approximately 13 million lines deployed by a third party and co-financed by Orange by 2023 (Source: _Orange press release). Furthermore, other operators may obtain access to the infrastructure deployed by an operator, through joint projects for financing. All of the DSL operators have announced various agreements on sharing the deployment of FTTH in given areas. For example, Orange and Free entered into a contract in July 2013 providing for the deployment by Free of a fiber network using Orange’s infrastructure in approximately 20 French cities, which allows for open access to all competing operators. In addition, in 2013 the French government announced a FTTH deployment plan of €20 billion (invested by private operators and local authorities) with the objective of providing very-high-speed internet access to the entire territory in 2022. The government will provide a subsidy package of approximately €3,300 million, partly from funding from the Investments for the Future Program managed by the Office of the General Commissioner of Investment under the 2015 Budget Act. The rollout has been divided in three zones: very dense areas (approximately six million households) and low-density areas (approximately 13 million households), that are already covered or will be covered by FTTH with privately-funded networks; and low-density areas (approximately 15 million households), where private operators will co-invest with public partners. Orange and the Group will lead the deployment of the very-high speed network in privately-funded, low density areas, with the Group being in charge of approximately 20% of the network deployment. Various local and regional authorities have already extended subsidies to network operators, including the Group, to install FTTH connections. This trend should continue, as certain departments, municipalities and regions, such as Hauts-deSeine, Amiens and Louvin, for example, have entered into public-private partnerships to encourage such investments. In such areas, various operators will have access to the network and will be able to compete. In addition, in accordance with the conditions established by ARCEP, third-party operators may have access to the infrastructure used by an operator, including by co-financing projects, for their own very-high-speed internet offers. As a result, FTTH deployment by the Group’s competitors could accelerate and the share of FTTH on the highspeed internet market could grow significantly, thereby eliminating or reducing the Group’s fixed network advantage. VDSL2 technology has also been implemented in some areas by competitors of the Group. Deployment of VDSL2 only requires adding VDSL2 cards in already deployed digital subscriber line access multiplexers (“DSLAMs”) and does not involve physical intervention at the subscriber’s premises. Moreover, the deployment of this technology has accelerated since October 2014 given the favorable opinion of the copper experts committee that has allowed the marketing, starting from that date, of VDSL2 in indirect distribution on all lines from a main distribution frame (“MDF”) on Orange’s local copper loop. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 5,950,000 households were eligible for VDSL2 (source: ARCEP). If the competitors of the Group continue to deploy or significantly increase their fiber optic networks they could be able to compete with the Group in terms of the offering of high-speed internet and television services of a quality and speed greater than or equal to those of the Group, thus potentially eliminating the Group’s current competitive advantage, increasing the pressure upon prices and margins and leading the Group to make significant investments in order to match the services they offer. Deployment of VDSL2 and/or fiber optic networks by competitors also represents a risk for the business services activity of the Group, particularly with regard to medium-sized, small-to-medium-sized and very-small-sized businesses to which the Group’s DSL and fiber/cable networks network presently represent an advantage. Although the Group is preparing for this deployment by improving its product range and building out its fiber/cable network, such deployment could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial position and results of operations.",,,,
16,Final Offerings 2020.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.1,"Risks Relating to the Group’s Business, Technology and Competition",1.1.3,"Changes in competitive offerings for content, including the potential rapid adoption of piracy-based video offerings, could adversely impact the Group’s business.","The market for content is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change. Through new and existing distribution channels, consumers have increasing options to access entertainment video, sports and other content. The various economic models underlying these channels include subscription, transactional, ad-supported and piracy-based models. All of these have the potential to capture meaningful segments of the content market. Piracy, in particular, threatens to damage the Group’s business, as its fundamental proposition of virtually all content being offered for ----- free to consumers is so compelling and difficult to compete against. Furthermore, in light of the compelling consumer proposition, piracy services are subject to rapid global growth. Traditional providers of content, including broadcasters, as well as internet based e-commerce or content providers are increasing their internetbased offerings. Several of these competitors have long operating histories, large customer bases, strong brand recognition and significant financial, marketing and other resources. They may secure better terms from suppliers, adopt more aggressive pricing and devote more resources to product development, technology, infrastructure, content acquisitions and marketing. New entrants may enter the market, or existing providers may adjust their services, with unique offerings or approaches to providing content. Companies also may enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive positions. If the Group is unable to successfully or profitably compete with current and new competitors, the Group’s business will be adversely affected, and it may not be able to increase or maintain market share, revenues or profitability.",,,,
16,Final Offerings 2020.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.1,"Risks Relating to the Group’s Business, Technology and Competition",1.1.4,"Acquisitions and other strategic transactions present many risks, including the risk that the Group may not be able to integrate newly acquired operations into its business, which may prevent the Group from realizing the strategic and financial goals contemplated at the time of any such transaction and thus adversely affect the its business.","Historically, the Group’s business has grown, in part, through a significant number of selective acquisitions, including the SFR Acquisition that has enabled the Group to take advantage of existing networks, service offerings and management expertise. The Group may continue to grow its business through acquisitions of broadband and mobile communications businesses, content companies and ancillary services that we believe will present opportunities to create value by generating strong cash flows and operational synergies. In addition, we have recently entered into certain strategic transactions, such as the Towers Transactions and the sale of the Group’s Voice Carrier Business, to monetize the value of certain of our non-core assets in France, and the sale of a 49.99% interest in SFR FTTH to create an alternative FTTH infrastructure wholesale operator. Moreover, SFR FTTH (an associate of the Group) has entered into agreement to acquire all of the equity interests in Covage, which transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2020. In the future, the Group may enter into similar transactions. Any acquisition, disposal or other strategic transaction the Group may undertake in the future could result in the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities and an increase in interest expenses, amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets or in the use by us of available cash on hand to finance any such acquisitions. The Group may experience difficulties in integrating acquired operations into the Group’s business, incur higher than expected costs or fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits or synergies of these acquisitions, if any. Such transactions may also disrupt the Group’s relationships with current and new employees, customers and suppliers. In addition, the Group’s management may be distracted by such acquisitions and the integration of acquired businesses. Thus, if the Group consummates any further acquisitions or fail to integrate any previous acquisitions, there could be a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in completing business acquisitions or integrating previously acquired companies. In addition, the Group’s debt burden may increase if we borrow funds to finance any future transactions, which could have a negative impact on the Group’s cash flows and the Group’s ability to finance our overall operations. Acquisitions or disposals of additional telecommunications companies may require the approval of governmental authorities (either domestically or, in the case of the EU, at the EU level), which can block, impose conditions on, or delay the process which could result in a failure on our part to proceed with announced transactions on a timely basis or at all, thus hampering our opportunities for growth. In the event conditions are imposed and we fail to meet them in a timely manner, the relevant governmental authority may impose fines and, if in connection with a merger transaction, may require restorative measures, such as mandatory disposition of assets or divestiture of operations. Although we analyze and conduct due diligence on acquisition targets, our assessments are subject to a number of assumptions concerning profitability, growth, interest rates and company valuations and our inquiries may fail to uncover relevant information. There can be no assurance that our assessments or due diligence of and assumptions regarding acquisition targets will prove to be correct, and actual developments may differ significantly from our expectations. Moreover, our plans to acquire additional businesses in the future are subject to the availability of suitable opportunities. The Group’s competitors may also follow similar acquisition strategies and may have greater financial resources available for investments or may be willing to accept less favorable terms than we can accept, which may prevent us from acquiring businesses that we target to the benefit of our competitors. ----- The operating complexity of the Group’s business and the responsibilities of management have increased significantly as a result of the growth of our business through acquisitions, which may place significant strain on our managerial and operational resources. The Group may be unable to allocate sufficient managerial and operational resources to meet our needs as our business grows, and our current operational and financial systems and managerial controls and procedures may become inadequate. Although the Group considers the operational and financial systems and managerial controls and procedures that we currently have in place to be adequate for the Group’s purposes, we recognize that the effectiveness of these systems, controls and procedures needs to be kept under regular review as the Group’s business grows. The Group will have to maintain close coordination among our logistical, technical, accounting, finance, marketing and sales personnel. Management of growth will also require, among other things, continued development of financial and management controls and information technology systems. The constant growth may strain our managerial resources which may require the Group to hire additional managerial resources. The Group may be unable to hire managers with the relevant expertise or the hiring process may require significant time and resources, all of which could result in a disruption in the Group’s management, growth, operational and financial systems, managerial controls and procedures and, accordingly, the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations. The Group periodically evaluates, and has engaged in, the disposition of certain non-core assets and businesses. Divestitures could involve difficulties in the separation of operations, services, products and personnel, the diversion of management’s attention, the disruption of our business and the potential loss of key employees. After reaching an agreement with a buyer for the disposition of a business, the transaction may be subject to the satisfaction of pre-closing conditions as well as to obtaining necessary regulatory and government approvals, which, if not satisfied or obtained, may prevent us from completing the transaction. Divestitures may also involve continued financial involvement in the divested assets and businesses, such as indemnities or other financial obligations, in which the performance of the divested assets or businesses could impact our results of operations. Any divestiture the Group undertakes could adversely affect the Group’s financial condition and results of operations. In certain cases, the Group has entered into or may enter into joint venture arrangements with a majority or minority interest in such joint ventures. Even in cases where the Group has retained a majority interest, the joint venture partner may have significant influence over policies, including consent rights with respect to certain specified matters. The Group has a lesser degree of control over the business operations of the joint ventures and businesses in which it has made minority investments.",,,,
16,Final Offerings 2020.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.1,"Risks Relating to the Group’s Business, Technology and Competition",1.1.5,The Group might not be able to effectively implement or adapt its business strategy.,"The Group has based its strategy on its vision of the market, especially the importance of very-high-speed fiber/cable and mobile networks and of fixed-mobile convergence. At the core of the Group’s strategy has been revenue, profitability and cash flow growth. Key elements of this strategy have included: (i) operational and financial turnaround under the leadership of a new management team; (ii) optimizing commercial performance with a particular focus on customer services; (iii) continuing to invest in best-in-class infrastructure commensurate with its market position; and (iv) monetizing content investments through various pay-TV models and growing advertising revenue. However, the Group is evolving in a market affected by economic, competitive and regulatory uncertainty and the Group must regularly adapt its business model to take into account market changes such as changes in consumer behavior, introduction of new technology, products or services, competition and the development of specific pricing policies, the adaptation of its structural costs, the streamlining of its operational organization, and the adaptation of its sales strategy. If the measures taken by the Group do not meet the demands, expectations, or habits of the consumer, it will have an adverse effect on the return on investments, financial targets, market share, and revenues generated. Consequently, any development of the Group’s business strategy that proves not to be sufficiently adapted to the actual trends and demands, expectations, or habits of the consumer in the telecommunications market may not achieve its desired goals and/or have a material adverse effect on its business, financial position and results of operations. Moreover, the transformation of the Group following the execution of certain strategic transactions, including non-core asset disposals, strategic acquisitions and investments or entry into joint venture arrangements, could create operational difficulties and unforeseen expenses and could give rise to significant administrative, financial, and managerial challenges involving the activity of the Group. Such strategic transactions may also disrupt its ongoing business, cause management’s attention to be diverted and result in legal, regulatory, contractual, labor, or other difficulties that have not been foreseen or disclosed. -----",,,,
16,Final Offerings 2020.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.1,"Risks Relating to the Group’s Business, Technology and Competition",1.1.6,"Revenue from certain of the Group’s services has been declining or not growing, and the Group may be unable to offset such trends.","The Group’s total revenues and revenues in the residential fixed, residential mobile, business services and media segments declined in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. While the Group’s total revenues increased for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31 2018, there was a decrease in revenues in the residential-fixed and media segments. Similarly, while the Group’s total revenue increased for the six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2019, there was a decrease in revenues in the equipment sales and media segments. The Group’s Adjusted EBITDA remained flat for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 and for the six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to June 30, 2019, but increased for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. While the Group is focused on achieving an operational financial turnaround, there can be no assurance that this trend of declines in revenue will not continue in future periods. The Group expects its DSL business with Bouygues Telecom to continue to decline. In particular, churn in Bouygues Telecom’s DSL white label customers has already led to a decrease in white label subscribers. If the revenue and profitability loss from such businesses is not offset by revenue and profitability growth in other Group businesses, this could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business activities, the results of its operation and financial condition. In addition, the Group could experience further decreases in customers on its DSL network in the future due to their migration to fiber/cable networks providing them with access to greater internet speeds compared with those available on DSL networks. If the revenue and profitability loss from customers on the Group’s DSL network is not offset by revenue and profitability growth on the Group’s fiber/cable network, this could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business activities, the results of operation and financial condition.",,,,
16,Final Offerings 2020.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.1,"Risks Relating to the Group’s Business, Technology and Competition",1.1.7,"Customer churn, or the threat of customer churn, may adversely affect the Group’s business.","The Group’s ability to attract and retain subscribers to its services or to increase profitability from existing subscribers will depend in large part on the Group’s ability to stimulate and increase subscriber usage, convince subscribers to switch from competitors’ services to our services and the Group’s ability to minimize customer churn. Customer churn is a measure of the number of customers who stop subscribing for one or more of our products or services. Churn arises mainly as a result of the contractual subscription period (generally 12 months in the residential segments and between one and three years in the business services market), competitive influences, the relocation of clients outside of the Group’s network area (which is less extensive than our competitors), introduction of new products and technologies, deterioration of personal financial circumstances, price increases and regulatory developments. Customer churn may also increase if the Group is unable to deliver satisfactory services over its network, or if it modifies the types of services it makes available in a certain region. In addition, customer churn also arises upon the cancellation of services to customers who are delinquent in their payments to the Group. In addition, the Group outsources many of its customer service functions to third party contractors over which the Group has less control than if it were performing those tasks itself. The Group has experienced significant churn in mobile and fixed customers in recent years due to intense competition. Moreover, the churn rate in the Group’s white label business may increase for reasons outside the Group’s control (as it is not involved in client services and retention). In particular, churn in Bouygues Telecom’s DSL white label customers has already led to a decrease in white label subscribers, which is expected to continue in the long term. See “Business of the Group—Material Contracts—White Label Agreements”. If the Group fails to effectively communicate the benefits of the Group’s networks through its marketing advertising efforts, it may not be able to attract new customers and our efforts to attract and retain customers may prove unsuccessful. In addition, any interruption of the Group’s services or the removal or unavailability of programming, which may not be under our control, could contribute to increased customer churn. Further the Group’s competitors may improve their ability to attract new customers, for example by offering new product bundles or product offerings at lower prices than the Group, which would make it difficult for the Group to retain its current subscribers, and the cost of retaining and acquiring new subscribers could increase. In addition, the Group’s business services operations are also subject to tariff churn (i.e. an existing customer negotiating tariff decreases). Large corporate customers in particular are highly sophisticated and often aggressive in seeking to renegotiate the pricing of their contracts, which tends to result in margin pressure. Increased customer or tariff churn may have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations. -----",,,,

The Group’s long term results of operations therefore depend substantially upon its ability to continue to conceive, design, source and market new products and services as well as continuing market acceptance of the Group’s existing and future products and services. Should the Group fail to or be significantly delayed in introducing new products and services in the future, if the Group’s new products and services are not accepted by customers, or if the Group’s competitors introduce more sophisticated or more popular products and services, the Group’s business and results of operations may be adversely affected.",,,,
16,Final Offerings 2020.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.1,"Risks Relating to the Group’s Business, Technology and Competition",1.1.10,"If the Group is unable to obtain attractive content on satisfactory terms for its services, the demand for these services could be reduced, thereby lowering revenue and profitability.","The success of the Group’s pay-TV services depends on access to an attractive selection of television programming. For example, the ability to provide movies, sports and other popular programming, including videoon-demand (“VOD”) content, is a major factor that attracts subscribers to pay-TV services, especially premium services. The Group relies on digital programming suppliers for a significant portion of the Group’s programming content and VOD services. The Group may not be able to obtain sufficient high quality programming, sports and other content from third party producers for the Group’s digital cable television and other services on satisfactory terms or at all in order to offer compelling digital cable television services. The Group also relies on certain of its competitors for the provision of certain content offerings. In addition, to the extent that the Group is unable to reach agreements with certain content providers on terms that the Group believes is reasonable, the Group may be forced, or may determine for strategic or business reasons, to remove such content from its line-up and may decide to replace it with other programming, which may not be available on acceptable terms or be as attractive to customers. There can be no assurance that the Group’s expiring programming and other content contracts will be renewed on favorable or comparable terms or at all, or that the rights the Group negotiates will be adequate for it to execute the Group’s business strategy. The inability to obtain high quality content, may also limit the Group’s ability to migrate customers from lower tier programming to higher tier products, thereby inhibiting the Group’s ability to execute its business strategy. Any or all of these factors could result in reduced demand for, and lower revenue and profitability from, the Group’s digital cable television and other content services. Programming and content-related costs are one of the Group’s largest categories of expenses. In recent years, the cost of programming in the cable and satellite video industries has increased significantly and is expected to continue to increase, particularly with respect to costs for sports programming and broadcast networks. The Group may not be able to pass these increased programming costs on to the Group’s subscribers due to the increasingly competitive environment that the Group operates in. If the Group is unable to pass these increased programming costs on to its subscribers, its business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. Moreover, programming costs typically include a minimum guaranteed amount and a variable amount related directly to the number of subscribers to whom the programming is provided, which may affect the Group’s ability to negotiate lower per-subscriber programming costs and which could impact the Group’s operating margins. The expiration dates of the Group’s various programming contracts are staggered, which results in the expiration of a portion of its programming contracts throughout each year. The Group may not be able to renegotiate these agreements on terms as favorable as those of the current agreements, or at all, which could result in a decline in the revenue generated or an increase in the Group’s costs deriving from broadcaster licences. The Group attempts to control its programming costs and, therefore, the cost of the video services it charges to its customers, by negotiating favorable terms for the renewal of its affiliation agreements with programmers. To the ----- extent the Group is unable to reach agreements with certain programmers on terms it believes are reasonable, the Group may be forced to, or determine for strategic reasons to, remove certain programming from its line-up and may decide to replace such programming with alternatives which may not be as attractive to consumers or available on acceptable terms. Such negotiations have in the past and may in the future affect the Group’s carriage of particular programming services. Some of the Group’s programming contracts require it to pay prices for the programming based on a guaranteed minimum number of subscribers, even if that number is larger than the number of actual subscribers, whereas some of the Group’s programming contracts are based on a flat fee irrespective of the popularity of the content purchased under such contract. As a result, if the Group misjudges anticipated demand for the programming or if the programming it acquires does not attract the number of viewers anticipated, the profitability of the Group’s television services may be impaired. Furthermore, as the Group purchases a significant portion of its content from various content providers under relatively short term contracts, the prices the Group pays to purchase such content is subject to change and may increase significantly in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s results of operations. Furthermore, program providers and broadcasters may elect to distribute their programming through other distribution platforms, such as satellite platforms, digital terrestrial broadcasting or IPTV, or may enter into exclusive arrangements with other distributors. Such actions may inconvenience some of the Group’s subscribers and can lead to customer dissatisfaction and, in certain cases, the loss of customers, which may have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, as long as the Group continues to develop its VOD and other interactive services, its ability to acquire programs for its free VOD offerings (replay), VOD by subscription, and one-time VOD will become more and more crucial and will depend on the ability of the Group to maintain a relationship and cooperation with content providers and broadcasters, for both standard-definition as well as HD content. If the Group cannot obtain and keep competitive programs at attractive prices on its networks, demand for its services could decline, thus limiting its ability to maintain or increase the revenue. A loss of programs or an inability to ensure the availability of premium content under favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on the business activities of the Group, its financial position and its results of operations.",,,,
16,Final Offerings 2020.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.1,"Risks Relating to the Group’s Business, Technology and Competition",1.1.11,The Group’s business is capital-intensive and its capital expenditures may not generate a positive return or the Group may be unable or unwilling to make additional capital expenditures.,"The Group’s business demands significant capital expenditures to add customers to our networks, including expenditures relating to equipment and labor. In particular, the Group incurs significant capital expenses for the deployment of new technologies such as 4G and 5G (for the purchase of frequencies and the deployment of network infrastructures) for its mobile operations and fiber optics (for the deployment of the fiber infrastructure) and for its fixed operations. Moreover, as spectrum auctions are infrequent and the Group may need additional spectrum in the future, the Group will likely participate in future spectrum auctions even though it might not, at the time of auction, require additional spectrum capacity. Such participation would require significant capital expenditures in the near term as acquiring spectrum is expensive, due in part to the fact that spectrum availability is limited. Furthermore, new technologies and the use of multiple applications increasing customers’ bandwidth requirements could lead to saturation of the networks and require telecommunications operators to make additional investments to increase the capacity of their infrastructures. Moreover, the Group regularly invests in the content that we offer in order to provide our subscribers with a flexible and diverse range of programming and other content options, including high-quality local content and exclusive premium content, in order to reduce churn. For example, the structure of the French telecommunications market does not allow telecommunications operators to pass along their investment costs to the end consumer in proportion to the volume of data consumed. Accordingly, telecommunications operators may not benefit from increased revenues from the growing demand for data and content even though they incur the costs of such demand through their investments in infrastructure. The Group is also bound by certain obligations of access and/or coverage for its fiber/cable and/or mobile network, particularly under its mobile licences, such as obligations to allow roaming or sharing of networks in certain deployment zones. This requires the Group to make significant and frequent investments and the conditions for ----- the implementation of these obligations, including some prices (such as roaming rates), may be regulated within the EU. Given such constraints, the Group may not be able to operate its network under economically favorable conditions, which could affect the profitability of its investments. The Group may be subject to similar obligations in the future, which could have a material effect on the manner in which the Group operates its business and, accordingly, on its outlook, financial position or results of operations. It cannot be guaranteed that the Group will continue to have sufficient resources to maintain the quality of its network and of its other products and services, and to expand the Group’s network coverage, which are key elements for its growth of over the long term. Unforeseen investment expenses, an inability to finance them at an acceptable cost or even an inability to make profitable investments could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, outlook, financial position or results of operations.",,,,
16,Final Offerings 2020.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.1,"Risks Relating to the Group’s Business, Technology and Competition",1.1.12,The Group is subject to increasing operating costs and inflation risks which may adversely affect its earnings.,"While the Group generally attempts to increase our subscription rates to offset increases in operating costs, there is no assurance that it will be able to do so due to competitive and other factors. Therefore, operating costs may rise faster than associated revenue, resulting in a material negative impact on the Group’s cash flow and results of operations. The Group is also affected by inflationary increases in salaries, wages, benefits and other administrative costs which the Group may not be in a position to pass on to its customers, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations.",,,,
16,Final Offerings 2020.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.2,Risks Relating to the Group’s Financial Profile,1.2.1,"The Group’s significant leverage could adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations and prevent the Group from fulfiling its debt obligations under the Notes or impede its ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations.","The Group has significant outstanding debt and debt service requirements and may incur additional debt in the future. As of June 30, 2020, after giving effect to the Transactions, the Group had total third party debt (excluding other long term and short term liabilities, other than finance lease liabilities prior to giving effect to IFRS 16) of €18,636 million (comprising of the Notes offered hereby, the Existing Senior Secured Notes, the Existing Term Loans, the Existing Revolving Credit Facilities, the 2019 Hivory Senior Revolving Facilities and finance leases and other liabilities (prior to giving effect to IFRS 16). See “Capitalization.” For a description of such changes to our financial profile and our third party indebtedness, see “Description of Other Indebtedness”. The Group’s significant level of debt could have important consequences, including, but not limited to, the following: - requiring the Group to devote a significant portion of its cash flow deriving from its operations to the repayment of its debt, thus reducing the availability of the Group’s cash flows for financing internal growth using working capital and investments and for other general business requirements; - impeding the Group’s ability to compete with other providers of pay-TV, broadband internet services, fixed line telephony services, mobile services and business services in the regions in which it operates; - restricting the Group from exploiting business opportunities or making acquisitions or investments; - increasing the vulnerability of the Group to a business slowdown or to economic or industrial circumstances; - limiting the Group’s flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in its business and its sector; - adversely affecting public perception of the Group and its brands; - limiting the ability of the Group to make investments in its growth, especially those aimed at modernizing its network; and - in particular, limiting the Group’s ability to borrow additional funds in the future and to increase the costs of such additional financing, especially due to restrictive clauses in our current debt agreements. Any of these factors or their consequences could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s ability to satisfy its debt obligations under the Notes. The terms of the agreements and instruments governing the Group’s debt restrict, but do not prohibit, us from incurring additional debt. The Group may refinance our outstanding debt or increase our consolidated debt for various business reasons which might include, among other things, financing acquisitions, funding the prepayment premiums, if any, on the debt that we refinance, funding distributions to our shareholders or general corporate purposes. In the event that we incur additional debt, the related risks that we now face will intensify. -----",,,,

The Group cannot provide any assurance that its businesses will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future debt or equity financing will be available to the Group in an amount sufficient to enable the Group to pay its debt obligations when due. The ability of the Group to generate cash flows and finance its capital expenditures, current operations, and debt service obligations depends on numerous factors, including: - its future operating performance; - the demand and price levels for its current and projected products and services; - its ability to maintain the level of technical capacity required on its networks and the subscriber equipment and other pertinent equipment connected to the Group’s networks; - its ability to successfully introduce new products and services; - its ability to reduce the churn rate; - the general economic conditions and other circumstances affecting consumer spending; - competition; - sufficient distributable reserves, in accordance with applicable law; - the outcome of certain disputes in which it is involved; and - legal, tax and regulatory developments affecting the Group’s business. Some of these factors are beyond the control of the Group. If the Group is not able to generate sufficient cash flows it might not be able to repay its debt, expand its business, respond to competitive challenges, or finance its other cash and capital requirements, including capital expenditures. If the Group is not able to meet its debt service obligations, it might have to sell off assets, attempt to restructure or refinance its existing debt or seek additional financing in the form of debt or equity. The Group may not be able to do so in a satisfactory manner, or at all.",,,,

These covenants restrict the Group’s ability, and the ability of its subsidiaries, to, among other things: - pay dividends or make other distributions; - make certain investments or acquisitions, including participating in joint ventures; - make capital expenditures; - engage in transactions with affiliates and other related parties; - dispose of assets other than in the ordinary course of business; - merge with other companies; - incur additional debt and grant guarantees; - repurchase or redeem equity interests and subordinated debt or issue shares of subsidiaries; and ----- - grant liens and pledge assets. All of these limitations are subject to certain exceptions and qualifications, including the ability to pay dividends, make investments or to make significant prepayments of shareholder debt. However, these covenants could limit the Group’s ability to finance our future operations and capital needs and the Group’s ability to pursue business opportunities and activities that may be in our interest. In addition, the Group’s ability to comply with these restrictions may be affected by events beyond our control. In addition, the Group is also subject to the affirmative covenants contained in certain of the debt agreements it is a party to, which requires us to maintain specified leverage ratios, see “Description of Other Indebtedness”. The Group’s ability to meet these leverage ratios may be affected by events beyond its control and, as a result, the Group cannot assure you that it will be able to meet these ratios. In addition to limiting our flexibility in operating our business, the breach of any covenants or obligations under the agreements and instruments governing the Group’s debt may result in a default under the applicable debt agreement or instrument and could trigger the acceleration of related debt, which in turn could trigger defaults under agreements governing our other debt. A default under any of the agreements governing our other debt could materially adversely affect our growth, financial condition and results of operations.",,,,

16,Final Offerings 2020.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.2,Risks Relating to the Group’s Financial Profile,1.2.5,The Group is exposed to interest rate risks. Shifts in such rates may adversely affect its debt service obligations.,"The Group is exposed to the risk of fluctuations in interest rates, primarily under the Existing Term Loans. In addition, any amounts the Group borrows under the Existing Revolving Credit Facilities will bear interest at a floating rate. See “Description of Other Indebtedness”. An increase in the interest rates on the Group’s debt will reduce the funds available to repay its debt and to finance its operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities. The Group enters into various derivative transactions to manage exposure to movements in interest rates; however, there can be no assurance that it will be able to continue to do so at a reasonable cost. There can be no guarantee that the Group’s hedging strategies will adequately protect the Group from the effects of interest rate fluctuation, or that these hedges will not limit any benefit that we might otherwise receive from favorable movements in interest rates. Following allegations of manipulation of LIBOR, regulators and law enforcement agencies from a number of governments and the European Union are conducting investigations into whether the banks that contribute data in connection with the calculation of daily EURIBOR or the calculation of LIBOR may have been manipulating or attempting to manipulate EURIBOR and LIBOR. In addition, LIBOR, EURIBOR and other interest rates or other types of rates and indices which are deemed to be “benchmarks” are the subject of ongoing national and international regulatory reform, including the implementation of the IOSCO Principles for Financial Market Benchmarks (July 2013) and the new European regulation on indices used as benchmarks in financial instruments and financial contracts or to measure the performance of investment funds, which entered into force on June 30, 2016. Following the implementation of any such reforms, the manner of administration of benchmarks may change, with the result that they may perform differently than in the past, or benchmarks could be eliminated entirely, or there could be other consequences which cannot be predicted. For example, on July 27, 2017, the UK Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”) announced that it will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of the LIBOR benchmark after 2021 (the “FCA Announcement”). The FCA Announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed after 2021. The ----- potential elimination of the LIBOR benchmark or any other benchmark, changes in the manner of administration of any benchmark, or actions by regulators or law enforcement agencies could result in changes to the manner in which EURIBOR or LIBOR is determined, which could require an adjustment to the terms and conditions, or result in other consequences, in respect of any debt linked to such benchmark (including, but not limited to, the Existing Revolving Credit Facilities and/or the Existing Term Loans having interest rates that are linked to LIBOR or EURIBOR, as applicable). Any such change, as well as manipulative practices or the cessation thereof, may result in a sudden or prolonged increase in reported EURIBOR or LIBOR, which could have an adverse impact on the Group’s ability to service debt that bears interest at floating rates of interest.",,,,
16,Final Offerings 2020.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.2,Risks Relating to the Group’s Financial Profile,1.2.6,Changes or uncertainty in respect of LIBOR may affect the Group’s sources of funding.,"Some of the Group’s sources of funding are linked to LIBOR. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Term _Loans” and “Description of Other Indebtedness—Revolving Credit Facilities”. Various interest rate benchmarks_ (including LIBOR) are the subject of recent regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. Some reforms are already effective while others are still to be implemented, including the EU Benchmark Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/1011). In addition, the sustainability of LIBOR has been questioned by the FCA as a result of the absence of relevant active underlying markets and possible disincentives (including possibly as a result of regulatory reforms) for market participants to continue contributing to such benchmarks. On November 29, 2017, the Bank of England and the FCA announced that the market Working Group on Sterling Risk-Free Rates would have an extended mandate to catalyze a broad transition to the Sterling Over Night Index Average rate (“SONIA”) across sterling bond, loan and derivatives markets so that SONIA is established as the primary sterling interest rate benchmark by the end of 2021. The Bank of England and FCA have stated that a key near-term priority for the Working Group will be to make recommendations relating to the potential development of term SONIA reference rates. These reforms and other pressures may cause such benchmarks to disappear entirely, to perform differently than in the past (as a result of a change in methodology or otherwise), create disincentives for market participants to continue to administer or participate in certain benchmarks or have other consequences which cannot be predicted. Based on the foregoing, investors should in particular be aware that: - any of the reforms or pressures described above or any other changes to a relevant interest rate benchmark (including LIBOR) could affect the level of the published rate, including to cause it to be lower and/or more volatile than it would otherwise be; and - if LIBOR is discontinued, then the rate of interest applicable to the Group’s sources of funding may be determined for a period by applicable fall-back provisions, although such provisions, often being dependent in part upon the provision by reference banks of offered quotations for the LIBOR rate, may not operate as intended (depending on market circumstances and the availability of rates information at the relevant time) and may in certain circumstances result in the effective application of a fixed rate based on the rate which applied in the previous period when LIBOR was available. More generally, any of the above matters or any other significant change to the setting or existence of LIBOR could affect the Group’s ability to meet our obligations under the Group’s sources of funding and/or could have a material adverse effect on the liquidity of, and the amount payable under, the Group’s sources of funding. See also “—The Group is exposed to interest rate risks. Shifts in such rates may adversely affect the Group’s debt _service obligations.” Changes in the manner of administration of LIBOR could result in adjustments to the_ conditions applicable to the Group’s sources of funding or other consequences relevant to the Group’s sources of funding. No assurance can be provided that changes will not be made to LIBOR or any other relevant benchmark rate and/or that such benchmarks will continue to exist.",,,,

The primary transactional currency of the Group is euro and most of the Group’s revenues and operating cash flows are in euro. The Group conducts, and will continue to conduct, transactions in currencies other than such primary transactional currencies, particularly the U.S. dollar. A significant portion of the Group’s existing debt is denominated in U.S. dollars. The exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the euro has fluctuated significantly in recent years and may continue to fluctuate significantly in the future. The Group has historically covered a portion of our U.S. dollar cash outflows arising on anticipated and committed obligations through the use of foreign exchange derivative instruments. Further, while we manage the risk of certain currency fluctuations in respect of a portion of our existing debt and to hedge our exposure to interest rate changes in respect of indebtedness linked to interest rates, these arrangements may be costly and may not insulate us completely from such exposure. There can be no ----- guarantee that our hedging strategies will adequately protect our operating results from the effects of exchange rate fluctuation or changes in interest rates, or that these hedges will not limit any benefit that we might otherwise receive from favorable movements in exchange rates or interest rates.",,,,

The ratings may not reflect the potential impact of all risks related to the structure, market, additional risk factors discussed herein and other factors that may affect the value of the Notes. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal by the rating agency at any time. No assurance can be given that a credit rating will remain constant for any given period of time or that a credit rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by the credit rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances in the future so warrant. A suspension, reduction or withdrawal at any time of the credit rating assigned to the Notes by one or more of the credit rating agencies may adversely affect the cost and terms and conditions of our financings and could adversely affect the value and trading of such Notes. A downgrade in our credit rating may negatively affect the Group’s ability to obtain future financing to fund our operations and capital needs, which may affect our liquidity. It may also increase our financing costs by increasing the interest rates of our outstanding debt or the interest rates at which it is able to refinance existing debt or incur additional debt. There can be no assurance that the Group’s corporate rating, or the instrument rating with respect to the Notes, will be maintained at existing levels. See “—Risks Relating to the Notes—Credit ratings may not _reflect all risks”._ Because the financial condition, revenues and profitability of our operating subsidiaries are closely linked to the economies of their countries of operations, we expect that the Group as a whole will also be impacted by any downgrading in the sovereign debt rating of such countries.

Such regulation and supervision, as well as future changes in laws or regulations or in their interpretation or enforcement that affect us, our competitors or our industry, strongly influence how we operate our business. Complying with existing and future law and regulations may increase our operational and administrative expenses, restrict the Group’s ability or make it more difficult to implement price increases, affect the Group’s ability to introduce new services, force us to change our marketing and other business practices, and/or otherwise limit our revenues. In particular, our business could be materially and adversely affected by any changes in relevant laws or regulations (or in their interpretation) regarding, for example, licensing requirements, access and price regulation, interconnection arrangements or the imposition of universal service obligations, or any change in policy allowing more favorable conditions for other operators or increasing competition. There can be no assurance to you that the provision of our services will not be subject to greater regulation in the future. Furthermore, a failure to comply with the applicable rules and regulations could result in penalties, restrictions on our business or loss of required licenses or other adverse consequences. Although the regulations applicable to our business vary, such regulations may include, amongst other things: - price regulation for certain of the services we offer, exit fees and cancellation charges; - rules governing the interconnection between different telephone networks and the interconnection rates that we can charge and that we pay; - requirements that, under specified circumstances, a cable system carry certain broadcast stations or obtain consent to carry a broadcast station; - rules for authorizations, licensing, acquisitions, renewals and transfers of licenses and franchises; - requirements that we provide or contribute to the provision of certain universal services; - rules and regulations relating to subscriber privacy and data protection; ----- - rules and regulations relating to our networks, including universal access obligations imposed on us, coinstallation and co-location obligations (including our submarine cable landing stations), right of way and ownership considerations; - rules governing the copyright royalties; requirements on portability; and - other requirements covering a variety of operational areas such as equal employment opportunity, emergency alert systems, disability access, technical standards, environmental standards, city planning rules and customer service and consumer protection requirements. The regulations applicable to our operations within the EU often derive from EU Directives. The various Directives require EU Member States to harmonize their laws on communications and cover such issues as access, user rights, privacy and competition. These Directives are reviewed by the EU from time to time and any changes to them could lead to substantial changes in the way in which our business is regulated and to which we would have to adapt. In addition, the Group is subject to antitrust rules and regulations and are, from time to time, subject to review by authorities concerning whether we exhibit monopoly power in any of the market in which we operate. To the extent that the Group is deemed by relevant authorities to exhibit significant market power, we can be subject to various regulatory obligations adversely affecting our results of operations and profitability. Regulatory authorities may also require the Group to grant third parties access to our bandwidth, frequency capacity, facilities or services to distribute their own services or resell our services to end customers. Currently, the Group is considered to have significant market power in France. No assurance can be given that we will not be identified as having significant market power in the future and we will not be subject to additional regulatory requirements.",,,,
16,Final Offerings 2020.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.3,Risks Relating to Legislative and Regulatory Matters,1.3.2,Future regulatory changes could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business.,"The Group is subject to the provisions of the French Postal and Electronic Communications Code (“CPCE”), which imposes certain general obligations on all operators and certain specific obligations on mobile operators. The French regulatory framework applicable to operators is also subject to the analysis of the relevant markets carried out by the French telecom regulator (“ARCEP”) which is charged with (i) defining the relevant markets in France, (ii) analyzing the markets or identifying the companies reputed for exercising significant influence on these markets and (iii) deciding whether or not to impose on these companies regulatory obligations to remedy the effects of such influence. The Group is not considered by ARCEP to be an operator deemed to have significant influence over a relevant market, except over the markets for voice-call termination on its fixed and mobile networks. Nevertheless, it cannot be guaranteed that the Group, in the future, will not be identified by ARCEP as an operator deemed to exercise significant power in one or more relevant markets, and that ARCEP will not therefore impose additional regulatory obligations in this regard. For example, the possibility cannot be excluded that, in the future, particularly in the context of a growth in FTTH networks, the Group may be required to grant competitors some access to its fiber optic network, under conditions to be determined. At the request of the French Competition Authority, ARCEP has recently issued an opinion addressing the issues raised by the digital revolution currently affecting the audiovisual sector (ARCEP opinion dated October 11, 2018). In this document, ARCEP provided an overview of audiovisual content broadcasting techniques (DTT, copper and fiber networks, satellite, OTT and cable networks) before detailing the sector’s recent evolutions at both the operator and consumer ends, emphasizing the necessity to determine a common technical framework for these new services. ARCEP has not provided a timeline for the determination of such framework and has recommended the implementation of a horizontal regulation for all devices allowing access to audiovisual content. As the technical framework develops, the Group may be subject to ongoing obligations. The Group is also subject to other individual obligations resulting from the approvals to use frequencies. See “— _The Group can only operate its business for as long as it has licenses from the relevant authorities and it may not be able to obtain, retain or review the licenses and authorizations necessary for conducting its activities.”_ In September 2017, the French government asked ARCEP to begin work on the binding commitments that mobile operators were likely to make, above and beyond their existing rollout plans. Based on ARCEP’s proposals, and as part of a dialogue with mobile network operators, the French Government reached an agreement that aims to ----- ensure the availability of a high standard of mobile coverage for every person in France. With respect to these elements, mobile operators have committed to: - improving reception quality across the entire country, and particularly in rural areas. The new baseline quality standard applied to operators’ obligations will be that of “good coverage”; - increasing the pace of targeted programmes for improving coverage, with each operator deploying at least 5,000 new cell sites across the country to this end, some of which will be shared, which will henceforth go beyond so-called “white areas” and for which operators will now be fully responsible. Over the next three years, we will bring coverage to as many areas as the total number covered by government programmes over the past fifteen years. Government authorities will work closely with local authorities to identify the areas that need to be covered; - achieving ubiquitous 4G coverage, which will mean bringing it to more than a million additional people in 10,000 municipalities in France, by making every cell site 4G-capable; - accelerating the coverage of transportation routes, so that all of the major roads and railways have 4G coverage. The agreement also provides for coverage on regional railway lines; and - achieving ubiquitous indoor telephone coverage, notably by using voice over Wi-Fi. Facilitated by an increase of network sharing which ensures more efficient rollouts, along with a planned simplification of the measures contained in the new housing bill, stepping up the pace of deployment for new mobile phone equipment will significantly improve the user experience of mobile coverage in every part of the country. On July 3, 2018, ARCEP handed down a decision (decision no. 2018-0684) setting out the conditions under which licenses for 900 MHz, 1800 MHz and 2100 GHz-band frequencies may be granted in 2021, 2022 and 2024. One of these conditions is that operators are required to take actions to achieve the goals set out in Articles L. 32 et seq. of the CPCE (digital development of the French territory, fair and effective competition between operators on the mobile market and effective management and use of the frequency spectrum). Mobile operator frequency licences granted in July 2018 are now binding and a failure to meet these new obligations will result in sanctions from ARCEP. On June 4, 2019, ARCEP updated its mobile new deal roadmap underlining the priority of deploying and/or enhancing the quality of mobile coverage on highways and other strategic transport networks. On July 12, 2019, a new decree regarding network coverage obligations was passed. This decree identifies specific interests locations (strategic sites) that must be covered by mobile networks or in which the quality of the services provided must be improved by the operators. The decree no. 2019-1592 of December 31, 2019, initiated the 5G public tender and the ministerial decree of December 30, 2019 determined modalities and conditions for the tender. 31 frequencies in the 10 MHz band will be allocated as follows: - Four blocks of 50 MHz are expected to be allocated at a set price provided the operators agree on several commitments detailed in the tender specifications; and - The remaining frequencies will be allocated through an auction process, per blocks of 10 MHz. SFR, Orange, Free Mobile and Bouygues Telecom have agreed to obtain one of the four blocks of 50 MHz (comprising five blocks of 10 MHz each). On April 2, 2020, ARCEP announced that: - the four candidates were qualified; ----- - the four candidates had made the commitments set out in the specifications, and each will be able to obtain a block of 50 MHz at the end of this procedure, for the sum of €350 million. The four candidates are now authorised to participate in the auction stage, during which the 11 blocks of 10 MHz that remain available in the 3.4 – 3.8 GHz band will be awarded. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the main auction to award the remaining 11 blocks of 10 MHz have been postponed. Their allocation is scheduled to be launched on September 29, 2020. The Group monitors the regulations to which it is subject; however, the weight of the regulatory burden on “electronic” telecommunications operators, including the Group, may change and may lead to the application of different obligations in their regard depending on the level of ownership of direct access networks and the level of market power that may be more or less significant to or constrictive upon certain operators by virtue of changes in the technology used for providing services. If the Group becomes subject to regulations relatively more constrictive than its competitors, this could have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations or financial position. Furthermore, as an “electronic” telecommunications operator and a distributor of television services, the Group is subject to special taxes. The burden of such taxes could increase in the future due to changes in legislation. In addition, the Group cannot guarantee that additional taxes will not be instituted in the telecommunications industry. Any future restrictions on the Group’s ability to market its products or services in the way it wishes could have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations or financial position.",,,,
16,Final Offerings 2020.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.3,Risks Relating to Legislative and Regulatory Matters,1.3.3,The European Commission’s “Digital Single Market” legislation could adversely affect the Group’s businesses.,"The EU Regulation 531/2012, which initially set a rate for roaming, was further amended through the regulation 2015/2120 of 25/11/2015 to establish the conditions and the viability of a removal of retail roaming charges from June 15, 2017 (“roam like at home” subject to fair-usage). Moreover, the regulation introduces measures relating to “net neutrality”. Furthermore, the roaming regulation was completed by other pieces of legislation: - Implementing regulation EU 2016/2286 of 15/12/2016 laying down detailed rules on the application of fair use policy and on the methodology for assessing the sustainability of the abolition of retail roaming surcharges and on the application to be submitted by a roaming provider for the purposes of that assessment; and - Regulation UE 2017/920 of 17/05/2017 amending Regulation (EU) No 531/2012 with respect to rules for wholesale roaming markets. The Commission’s proposals on telecommunications markets presented in September 2016 intends to fix rules to support the creation of Gigabit Society. The electronic communications code proposal aims to make investment in very high capacity networks a binding objective and it also aims to promote sustainable long term competition. It was adopted through Directive 2018/1972 of December 11, 2018 establishing the European Electronic Communications Code (the “EECC”), which entered into force on December 20, 2018. This legislation is expected to have both a positive and adverse effect on revenue generated from the Group’s operations due to anticipated price decreases, higher operational costs and increased competition. All of these factors may adversely affect the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations. The EECC brings together the rules on electronic communications networks and services and aligns them with the latest technological developments. The EECC regulates (i) electronic communications networks and services (“ECN” and “ECS”), (ii) associated facilities and services, (iii) the authorisation of networks and services, (iv) radio spectrum use and numbering resources, (v) access to and interconnection of electronic communications networks and associated facilities and (vi) the protection of end-users. It aims to: - Promote connectivity, access to and take-up of very high capacity networks by all citizens and businesses of the EU; - Promote competition in the provision of electronic communication networks and services; ----- - Contribute to the development of the internal market in the field of electronic communications networks and services, radio spectrum, and connectivity; and - Promote the interests of European citizens. The EECC has singled out citizen connectivity as a key objective for the EU, since it is instrumental in guaranteeing freedom of expression, pluralism, democracy, culture, social cohesion, and even safety. The EECC also adopts a broader definition of ECS to regulate services delivered via internet (known as “over-the-top” or “OTT” services). ECS now includes internet access services, interpersonal communications services (“ICS”), and services consisting wholly or mainly in the conveyance of signals. The EECC also provides for strategic planning and coordination of a radio spectrum policy, as well as for effective management of radio spectrum by Member States. Finally, national regulation authorities are responsible for ensuring access, interconnection, and the interoperability of services. Consequently, and under certain circumstances, they can impose on undertakings obligations such as interconnecting networks, ensuring the interoperability of their services and granting physical access to their infrastructure. A public concertation was initiated on December 2019 with regard to the transposition into French national law of the EECC. The concertation covers the following topics: - the maximum duration of the contracts between customers and service providers, - framing the conditions under which bundled offers (mobile phone and plan) can be offered to the customers, - the regulation of added value services, - the termination conditions (to ensure that termination provisions do not carry any deterrent effect), and - the conditions under which service providers who refuse to respect the provisions of the EECC (number portability, change of operator, etc.) can be sanctioned. Member States must enact the EECC into their national laws by December 21, 2020. As of the date hereof, France has not yet enacted EECC into its national laws.",,,,
16,Final Offerings 2020.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.3,Risks Relating to Legislative and Regulatory Matters,1.3.4,The legal status of the Group’s network is complex and in certain cases subject to challenges or renewals.,"The legal status of the Group’s network is complex and the network is mainly governed by public law, which could affect the predictability of the Group’s rights over its network. For a description of the legal status of the Group’s cable network see “Regulation—Legal Status of Networks”. The Group’s telecommunications network is essentially composed of the physical infrastructure (conduits, network head-ends, switches and radio frequency stations) in which telecommunications (mainly cable) equipment is installed. These components of the Group’s network are subject to different legal regimes. As the Group does not own certain land where such physical infrastructures are located and infrastructure is established on public or private property, it has entered into concessions, rights-of-way, leases or even IRUs with the owners of the land. In order to establish a substantial part of its telecommunications network and of its wireless network, the Group has thus entered into public and private property occupancy agreements with public and private entities or holds public property occupancy permits. Under these agreements or permits, the Group may install its network equipment along roads, highways, railways or canals, for example. No transfer of ownership takes place within this framework. Such agreements are entered into for terms that vary greatly, from 3 to 25 years. The Group does not have any right to renewal of such agreements, although the agreements with the shortest terms generally provide for tacit renewal. The Group’s occupancy of public property, as is the case for all occupants of public property, is always precarious and subject to considerations beyond the Group’s control. The public entities with which the Group has entered into these agreements or that have issued permits to it can thus at any time terminate these public property occupancy agreements for misconduct or for reasons of public interest and some of the agreements even exclude any compensation in such case. ----- If the Group fails to obtain such renewal, the company involved would be obliged, upon expiration of these agreements, (i) to return the site to its original condition upon the demand of the manager or owner of the public property involved and/or (ii) to transfer to the latter, in certain cases for the payment of compensation and in certain cases free of charge, ownership of the facilities established on the property involved. If the Group loses all or part of the rights relating to its network, it could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial position, results of operations or outlook of the Group.",,,,

These authorizations generally require that we comply with applicable laws and regulations, meet certain solvency requirements and maintain minimum levels of service. Should the Group fail to comply with these, it may be subject to financial penalties from the relevant authorities and there may also be a risk that licenses could be partially or totally withdrawn. The imposition of fines and/or the withdrawal of licenses could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition and prevent us from conducting the Group’s business. In addition, such authorizations are generally granted for fixed terms and must be periodically renewed. The procedure for obtaining or renewing these licenses can be long and costly and authorities often demand concessions or other commitments as a condition for renewal. In addition, these licenses may not be obtainable or renewable in a timely manner or at all. In some instances, such authorizations have not been renewed at expiration, and we have operated and are operating under either temporary operating agreements or without an authorization while negotiating renewal terms with the local franchising authorities. Should we not be able to obtain or renew the licenses needed to operate or develop our business in a timely fashion, the Group’s ability to realize our strategic objectives may be compromised. In certain cases the Group’s mobile licenses require it to comply with certain obligations (population coverage, sharing in certain areas, national roaming) and the Group may suffer adverse consequences if is not able to comply with these obligations. In certain countries, we have provided significant bank guarantees to guarantee our performance under our licenses. If the Group is found to be in material breach of our licenses, the guarantees may be forfeited and our licenses may be revoked. Some of the Group’s activities depend on obtaining or renewing licences issued by regulatory authorities, particularly ARCEP in the telecommunications field and CSA in the audiovisual field. Under the licences allocated to the Group’s subsidiaries, the latter have committed themselves to complying with certain obligations (population coverage, sharing in some areas, roaming allowance). The Group is required to deploy a 3G and 4G generation radio network adhering to certain rates of coverage for the metropolitan population according to a given timetable. Within the framework of its 4G licences, if certain conditions are met, the Group will eventually have to allow Free Mobile roaming on a portion of its 4G network. The Group will also have to provide coverage, in conjunction with other 800 MHz band holders and under its 2G licence, for the city centers identified under the “white zones” plan, and accede to reasonable requests for network sharing in a priority deployment zone. The Group will also have to accede to reasonable requests to allow MVNOs throughout its very-high-speed mobile network open to the public in Metropolitan France. A failure to adhere to any one of these commitments could put the Group at risk under its regulatory obligations and possibly expose it to penalties (fines, total or partial suspension or withdrawal of licence). This could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial position, results of operations or outlook of the Group. To provide the Group’s various stakeholders with certainty over the future of some spectrum resources and with a view to issuing a call for applications that will enable a reallocation of longstanding 2G and 3G frequency bands for a period of 10 years (the licences relating to which will begin to expire in 2021), ARCEP has laid the ground rules for public consultation on the terms and conditions for such reallocation in its decision no. 2018-0684. The frequencies concerned are the frequencies in the 900 and 1800 MHz bands that were allocated to Orange, the Group and Bouygues Telecom in 2006 and 2009 for 15 years, and the 2.1 GHz band frequencies allocated to these same three operators in 2001 and 2002 for 20 years. Some of the existing 900, 1800 and 2100 MHz frequency licences for Metropolitan France are set to expire in 2021, 2022 and 2024. The terms for allocating frequencies seek to satisfy two main goals: digital regional development and achieving fair and effective competition between operators. The call for applications procedures for the allocation of 900, 1800 and 2100 MHz band frequencies took into account the goal of ensuring fair and effective competition in the mobile market by implementing the conditions needed to ensure that all mobile operators have fair and equal access to spectrum. It has been approved by the Minister responsible for electronic communications who launched the allocation procedure in early August 2018. The licences were awarded by ARCEP on November 15, 2018, and the frequencies will be made available starting in 2021. ----- The acquisition of licences also represents a high cost, the timing of which varies depending on when the frequencies involved are auctioned. Furthermore, this cost could rise due to strong competitive pressure in the telecommunications field. If we fail to obtain or retain, in a timely manner, the licences necessary for performing, continuing or developing our activities, the Group’s ability to achieve our strategic objectives could be subjected to alteration. In addition, the Group may fail to be awarded the desired licences, which could have an adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial position, results of operations or outlook. For further information on the licences and authorizations necessary for performance of the Group’s activities, see “Regulation”.",,,,
16,Final Offerings 2020.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.3,Risks Relating to Legislative and Regulatory Matters,1.3.6,There are uncertainties about the legal framework under which we own and operate certain of our networks.,"The Group’s systems depend on extensive physical facilities (lines, network, headends, switches and radio stations) in which telecommunication equipment (mainly cables) is installed. Significant portions of those physical facilities occupy public rights of way and are subject to governmental regulations. Other portions occupy private property under express or implied easements or pursuant to leases, and many miles of the cable are attached to utility poles governed by pole attachment agreements or other commercial arrangements. No assurances can be given that we will be able to maintain and use our facilities in their current locations and at their current costs. Changes in governmental regulations or changes in these relationships could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business and results of operations. In particular, the legal status of the Group’s network is complex, mainly governed by public and in certain cases subject to challenges or renewals. The Group’s telecommunications network is essentially composed of the physical infrastructure (conduits, network head-ends, switches and radio frequency stations) in which telecommunications (mainly cable) equipment is installed.

16,Final Offerings 2020.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.3,Risks Relating to Legislative and Regulatory Matters,1.3.7,The Group is subject to requirements in terms of protection of personal data and data security.,"Within the context of our business activities, we must collect and process personal data. In the EU, the European Parliament and the European Council adopted the regulation on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation, the “GDPR”) on April 27, 2016. The GDPR has been directly applicable in all EU member states since May 25, 2018, replacing Directive 95/46/EC and current national data protection legislation in member states, and was implemented in the EEA countries with effect from the same date. The GDPR significantly changes the EU/EEA data protection landscape, including strengthening of individuals’ rights, stricter requirements on companies processing personal data and stricter sanctions with substantial administrative fines. The GDPR also offers data subjects the option to let a privacy organization litigate on their behalf, including collecting the potential damages. After an initial transition period, data protection authorities across the EU have now begun using their new sanctioning powers (in 2019, Google was fined ----- €50 million by the French authority (CNIL), British Airways and Marriott were provisionally fined £183 million and £99 million, respectively by the UK authority (ICO), and many cases are currently under investigation). The Group does business in the hosting of data relating to the health of individuals, which subjects us to the specific obligations provided for by the Public Health Code such as obtaining and maintaining authorization or certification for the hosting of such data. If we breach our obligations or fail to adhere to the requirements applicable to sensitive data processing, the Group may be subjected to criminal and financial penalties likely to have a material adverse impact on our business, financial position and results of operations. In its judgment on October 6, 2015 (known as the “Schrems Judgment”), the European Court of Justice overturned the decision by the European Commission that the transfer of European personal data to the United States under the “Safe Harbor” framework provides an adequate level of protection. The successor “Privacy Shield” agreement negotiated by representatives of the EU and the United States have been overturned by a judgment of the European Court of Justice of July 16, 2020 (case C-311/18, known as “Schrems II”) which could impact our business and results. In 2016, the CJEU further clarified what safeguards are required for data retention to be lawful. In the case of Tele2 Sverige and Home Secretary v. Watson, the court concluded that Member States cannot impose a general obligation on providers of electronic telecommunications services to retain data, but did not ban data retention altogether. Such retention is compatible with EU law if deployed against specific targets to fight serious crime. Retention measures must be necessary and proportionate regarding the categories of data to be retained, the means of communication affected, the persons concerned and the chosen duration of retention. Furthermore, national authorities’ access to the retained data must be conditional and meet certain data protection safeguards. New data retention rules are currently being discussed at an EU level in response to this decision. In the case of Breyer, the CJEU concluded that Internet Protocol addresses may constitute personal data where the individual concerned can be identified, even where a third party must obtain additional data for the identification to take place. The CJEU also held that website operators may rely on a legitimate interest as a legal basis when retaining and using their visitors’ personal data. This is of major importance for data retention rules; it follows that online media service providers can lawfully store their visitors’ personal data to pursue a legitimate interest, rather than just for the purposes previously outlined in the invalidated Data Retention Directive. Thus, the grounds justifying data retention have become broader. The French legal framework for data protection has been gradually brought in line with the GDPR and the Police and Justice Directive. The French Data Protection Law of January 6, 1978 (Law no. 78-17), was amended by Law no. 2018-493 of June 20, 2018 and its implementing decree, and by decree no. 2018-687 of August 1, 2018. Such Law was rewritten and made consistent with GDPR by Order no. 2018-1225 of December 12, 2018. Finally, a new decree implementing the Law, no. 2019-536 of May 29, 2019 came into force on June 1, 2019. The French legal framework for data protection has now been stabilised. It imposes obligations on companies processing personal data in the context of the activities of an establishment in France concerning the conditions in which such a company may process personal data of individuals, the obtaining of their consent with respect to such processing (especially for the use of cookies) and carrying out the necessary measures for disclosure and transfer of data outside of the EU. Any breach of these obligations may lead to criminal and administrative financial penalties against us and damage to our reputation. On June 28, 2019, the French data protection authority (CNIL) announced new guidelines on the use of cookies for direct marketing purposes (online targeted advertisement), ruling out the use of implied or “soft” consent to place cookies on users’ devices. To assist companies in complying with these new rules, the CNIL published a draft recommendation on cookies on January 14, 2020 and the new legal regime applicable in France regarding cookies should be stabilised by the end of 2020. Regardless of the measures we adopt to protect the confidentiality, security of data and respect the rights of the people whose data we process, there remains the risk of possible attacks or breaches of data processing systems, which could give rise to penalties and damage our reputation. The Group could be compelled to incur additional costs in order to protect against these risks or to mitigate the consequences thereof, which could in turn have a material adverse impact on our business, financial position, results of operations or outlook. Furthermore, any loss of confidence on the part of our customers as a result of such events could lead to a significant decline in sales and have a material adverse impact on our business, financial position and results of operations. -----",,,,

However, our intellectual property rights or those of our licensors could be challenged or invalidated, we could have difficulty protecting or obtaining such rights or the rights may not be sufficient to permit us to take advantage of business opportunities, which could result in costly redesign efforts, discontinuance of certain product and service offerings or other competitive harm. The Group has received, and may receive in the future, claims of infringement or misappropriation of other parties’ proprietary rights, particularly creative rights with respect to broadcasted programs. In addition to claims relating to broadcasts on channels which the Group owns, it may be subject to intellectual property infringement claims with respect to programs broadcast on the other channels, including foreign channels that it carries. Moreover, the telecommunications industry is characterized by a high concentration of intellectual property rights, which increases the risk of litigation resulting from our activities upon the grounds of prior rights of third parties. Therefore, the Group is particularly exposed to the risk of proceedings initiated by patent trolls. See “—The Group _may be subject to intellectual property infringement claims by “patent trolls”.”_ Any such claims may require the Group to initiate or defend protracted and costly litigation, regardless of the merits of these claims. Successful challenges to our rights to intellectual property or claims of infringement of a third party’s intellectual property could require the Group to enter into royalty or licensing agreements on unfavorable terms, incur substantial monetary liability or be temporarily or permanently prohibited from further use of the intellectual property in question. This could require the Group to change our business practices and limit the Group’s ability to provide our customers with the content that they expect. Even if we believe that the claims of intellectual property infringement are without merit, defending against the claims can be time consuming and costly and may divert management’s attention and resources away from our business. An inability on our part to effectively protect certain important elements of our intellectual property rights and of our technology could have a material adverse effect on our activities, financial position, results of operations or outlook.",,,,

Such broad rights (such as in the GNU General Public Licence) are usually subject to the requirement that users not place any additional restrictions on access to the source code in any onward distribution of the software, and that such onward licensing be on the original licence terms. OSS is commonly viewed as having two major risks. First, the OSS licence usually also covers onward distributions of derivative works (based on the original OSS), with the result that proprietary software integrated with the OSS becomes “infected” and the entire integrated software program (OSS and proprietary software components) is covered by the OSS licence. One notable result of this is that the publisher or distributor of the derivative work would have to make available the source code of the entire work, including the proprietary software portions. The second commonly viewed risk is that OSS software is usually licenced “as is” without any contractual warranties. As a result, the Group would bear the risks in the event of defects with any OSS that the Group utilizes in its products and services without necessarily having any contractual recourse. Further, if the Group integrates OSS into any of the software that it publishes or distributes, then the use by the Group of OSS could have an impact on the ownership of the intellectual property in such software, particularly in terms of exclusivity, as the refusal to disclose any modifications made could be characterized as an infringement of the OSS licence. Moreover, the Group cannot rule out any risk of a request for disclosure or the request by a third party to access the modifications of the source code performed on such software. This situation could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial position, results of operations or outlook.",,,,

Considering the B2C activities of the Group, in the event of a challenge by consumers pertaining to the products or services offered by the Group, the Group could be faced, as could all operators in the industry, with possible class actions joining numerous customers desiring to obtain compensation for possible harm. Under such circumstance, if damages or prohibited practices are proven or even merely alleged the Group could face significant amounts in claims. Moreover, such actions could undermine the Group’s reputation.",,,,
