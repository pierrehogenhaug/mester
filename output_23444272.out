Does the text mention that the company is exposed to risks associated with cyclical products?

    Title: Our business is significantly dependent on our ability to generate rental income. Our rental income and funds from operations could particularly be negatively affected by a potential increase in vacancy rates.
    Text: We rely significantly on rental income. In the six-month period ended June 30, 2020, 84.7% of our revenue was derived from rental activities (including facility services), and our funds from operations (from rental activities) (“FFO 1”) amounted to €44,311 thousand (compared to 89.5% and €33,430 thousand in the six-month period ended June 30, 2019, respectively). Our rental income is impacted predominantly by the size of our portfolio, which consisted of 74,682 units (excluding parking spaces and other units) (with a total lettable area of 4,709,519 sqm) of which 72,380 were residential units (with a total lettable area of 4,440,581 sqm), as well as rent levels, which amounted to €6.20 per sqm on average (excluding parking spaces and other units) (all figures as of June 30, 2020). As a result, our performance depends largely on the amount of rental income generated, which in turn is significantly dependent on the vacancy levels of our portfolio. As of June 30, 2020, the average vacancy level of our residential portfolio (in % per sqm) was at 5.5% (or 243,859 sqm) and of our commercial portfolio at 7.8% (or 20,919 sqm), after 2.9% (or 42,771 sqm) and 4.8% (or 8,210 sqm), respectively, as of June 30, 2019. The vacancy levels within our portfolio could increase, particularly in lower-value residential units, in less attractive locations, in areas with weak infrastructure or in properties where investments do not result in increased rents in line with expected market rents or increased occupancy levels. Our strategy also focuses on the renovation and refurbishment of selected parts of our portfolio with the highest vacancy levels. If these measures do not result in a significant reduction in vacancy levels for these properties after completion of the renovation and refurbishment work, this could have an adverse effect on our financial results relative to our business plan. In addition to lost rental income, additional fixed and ancillary costs incurred for the maintenance of vacant residential units could reduce our operating profit. Furthermore, a longer period of high vacancy levels could generally lead to lower levels of income from rental activities and make it more difficult to increase average rental levels. As our income from rental activities (including facility services) represents 84.7% of the revenue generated in the six-month period ended June 30, 2020 (compared to 89.5% in the six-month period ended June 30, 2019), our ability to reduce vacancy levels or increase rents will significantly contribute to future growth of our revenue. -----

    Title: Our ability to operate our business successfully relies on assumptions that may prove to be incorrect and circumstances that may be unfavorable, in part or as a whole, in particular due to unexpected liabilities, an incomplete or inaccurate assessment of a market, value determinations and due diligence findings and challenges with respect to achieving anticipated synergies and insufficient investment horizons.
    Text: We face the risk that we may not be able to generate returns or generate significantly lower returns in the future. In particular, our projections of the future demand for apartments suitable for modernization may turn out to be inaccurate or inappropriate to achieve a positive return. Also, tenant preferences may change. Further, we may not be in a position to find sufficient investment opportunities to achieve further growth. In addition, we may not be able to pass on the costs for these modernization measures to our tenants due to legal constraints or if the tenants would be unable to afford rent increases as a result of these modernization measures. Tenants may also cause postponements to our modernization measures by, for example, refusing to vacate the units for modernization work to take place. Further, we may be restricted in our ability to finance the investment program through loans or other debt instruments depending on our current and future debt level and structure. The success of our business model depends in part on our ability to increase rent levels through modernizing our existing real estate portfolio and real estate properties that we acquire as well as our ability to estimate and control the costs of such modernizations. During the six-month period ended June 30, 2020, we incurred maintenance and capital expenditures of €11.5 per sqm (compared to €18.4 per sqm in the six-month period ended June 30, 2019), whereas our average like-for-like rental growth of the residential portfolio during the sixmonth period ended June 30, 2020 amounted to 1.9%. In the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, maintenance and capital expenditures amounted to €36.2 per sqm (compared to €39.2 per sqm in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018) and average like-for-like rental growth of the residential portfolio amounted to 5% for the same period. We plan to continue investing a significant amount into modernization measures, particularly in residential markets that provide for significant rent upside for refurbished apartments. Due to the current Berlin rent freeze (Mietendeckel), this is not the case for our property portfolio located in Berlin. There is no assurance that the targeted rent upside can be realized. Even if the existing real estate portfolio and the real estate properties that we may acquire can be repositioned, modernized and refurbished, such measures could prove to be unsuccessful or ineffective and not result in targeted rent levels. Further, our assumptions in relation to achievable rental levels, rental increases, vacancy rates, modernization costs, personnel (including in-house facility management personnel), overhead expenses, maintenance and capital expenditures may prove to be partially or entirely inaccurate. Furthermore, unforeseen issues or risks could materialize that could result in substantially increased maintenance and capital expenditures, in particular, due to changes in applicable laws and regulations; or we may be unable to resolve such issues or risks at all or not in an economically reasonable manner. Regarding environmental matters relevant to modernizations and refurbishments, see “—Regulatory _and Legal Risks—Our business is subject to the general legal environment in Germany. Any disadvantageous changes in the legal environment, such as mandatory environmental modernization provisions, restrictions regarding modernization measures or provisions (including taxes) that result in the incurrence of costs in the event of a property sale, or disadvantageous changes to the Berlin Mietspiegel regulation, may be detrimental to us.” and “We may incur environmental liabilities, for example, from residual pollution including wartime ordinance, soil conditions, asbestos and contaminants in building materials, as well as from possible building code violations.”._ In the event that a building is subject to historic preservation laws, compliance with the respective historic preservation requirements could significantly delay the refurbishment or modernization process and could result in significantly higher expenses for the particular project. Consequently, we may be unable to perform our obligations to a tenant, which could result in rent to be deferred or not due at all. In addition, legal requirements relating to our properties could become more stringent or onerous, particularly with respect to construction and environmental requirements; similarly, requirements might be imposed to increase the availability of handicapped-accessible and adapted housing. The realization of any of these risks could have a negative effect on our ability to successfully conduct our business and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects. -----

Does the text mention that the company is exposed to risks associated with cyclical products?

    Title: We rely on our ability to identify potential real estate portfolio acquisition opportunities in order to implement our investment strategies. We may not be able to identify all risks associated with any such acquisitions. Assumptions could prove to be insufficient or incorrect and a successful integration of acquisitions may not be achievable.
    Text: As part of our strategy, we evaluate real estate portfolios in order to identify those that might complement our existing portfolio and our current management platform. Between January 1, 2017 and June 30, 2020, we have acquired 4,650 residential real estate units with a total residential area of 322 thousand sqm. In addition, through the completion of the takeover offer for ADLER Real Estate Aktiengesellschaft (“ADLER Real Estate” and, together with its consolidated subsidiaries, the “ADLER Real Estate Group”), we acquired an additional 58,007 residential real estate units with a total residential area of 3,494,017 sqm. The units we have acquired or will acquire may generate less than the originally calculated rental income or operating profit due to inaccurate projections and assumptions or for other reasons. Although we have attempted and will continue to attempt to address the relevant issues, including for example tax, legal and operational management issues, arising from acquisitions, we may not have addressed and in the future may not address all relevant issues related thereto and to the successful integration of the acquired portfolios. In particular, the integration risks associated with acquisitions of large portfolios are high due to their significant size. The integration of any future portfolio acquisitions may not be successful or may be more difficult than expected due to legal and contractual restrictions and obligations. In addition, we may be unable to integrate acquisitions or realize anticipated synergies, economies of scale and cost-savings. We may become subject to contractual obligations under acquisition agreements pursuant to which we acquired our real estate portfolio, which limit our ability to fully integrate acquisitions on a legal and operational basis that may result in delays and unforeseen costs. Moreover, laws governing pensions, labor unions and works councils may also limit our ability to integrate acquisitions and especially to move employees from one legal entity to another. To the extent that we are not able to successfully integrate our current portfolio and any potential future portfolio acquisitions, we may be prevented from increasing revenues or reducing costs by achieving economies of scale in the manner that we anticipate. Any such failure could cause reduced levels of rental income and operating profit. Furthermore, investments in properties involve considerable risks. We are not always able to obtain from the seller the records and documents that we need in order to fully verify that the buildings we acquire were constructed in accordance, and that their use complies, with applicable planning laws and building code regulations. We may only be able to conduct limited due diligence on, or the due diligence conducted may not accurately reveal the risks associated with, the properties or entities we plan to acquire. Accordingly, we may not be in a position to examine whether the original owners of the properties, and/or the properties themselves, have obtained all required permits for new buildings, satisfied all permit conditions, received all necessary licenses and fire, health and safety certificates, or satisfied all comparable requirements. In addition, the properties may suffer from hidden defects, such as contamination, and may thus require significant modernization investments. For example, while performing due diligence, we may not have discovered, or the seller may not have disclosed, that the properties that we have acquired have underground oil tanks underneath them or contain certain types of fungus which may weaken the structural foundations of our acquired properties. In addition, we may not have been able or may be unable to undertake (or obtain results for) all searches (including title and collateral searches), inspections and surveys (including intrusive environmental and asbestos investigations and technical surveys) that we might otherwise carry out in relation to comparable acquisitions. Accordingly, in the course of the acquisition of residential and other property portfolios, specific risks may not be, or might not have been, recognized or evaluated correctly. Thus, legal and/or economic liabilities may be, or might have been, overlooked or misjudged. These circumstances could lead to additional costs and could have an adverse effect on our proceeds from sales and rental income of the relevant properties. The assumptions we rely on when acquiring real estate, particularly with respect to anticipated rents, achievability of vacancy reduction, maintenance expenses, integration costs and expected proceeds from condominium sales, could turn out to be incorrect. Although sellers typically make various warranties in purchase agreements that we enter into in connection with property acquisitions, it is possible that these warranties do not cover all risks or that they fail to cover such risks sufficiently. Additionally, a warranty made by a seller may be unenforceable due to the seller’s insolvency or for other reasons. In some cases, a real estate seller makes no representation or warranty as to the sufficiency and correctness of the information that is made available in the context of a due diligence investigation, or as to whether such information remains correct during the period between the conclusion of the due diligence and the closing of the relevant acquisition. Accordingly, such risks can arise despite a thorough due diligence. ----- It could also subsequently become more difficult to let or sell certain properties; market rents could develop unfavorably; and/or vacancy rates could increase. In addition, the various factors that affect market rents make it difficult to project future rental income, so that the rental income in relation to an acquired property can develop differently than projected. Our current portfolios, or portfolios that may be acquired in the future, may not develop as expected. For example, targeted rent increases may not be implemented as planned due to a lack of tenants who are willing or able to pay increased rents, a negative development of the location or property or increased vacancy rates, for example due to unfavorable demographic or economic developments. Any inability on our part to identify and assess all risks in connection with acquisitions as well as insufficient or inaccurate assumptions could hinder or render impossible a successful integration of acquisitions, as a result of which we may incur higher costs, lower rental income or divergent value developments, which in turn could lead to material adverse effects on our business, net assets, financial position and results of operations as well as our prospects.

Does the text mention that the company is exposed to risks associated with cyclical products?

    Title: Our business is dependent on regional real estate markets and their liquidity, particularly Berlin, which may be subject to adverse market developments. Fluctuation in the development of the currently high demand and prices could make it difficult for us to conduct our business activities and to implement our strategy to capture additional growth opportunities.
    Text: As of June 30, 2020, our real estate portfolio comprised 74,682 units (excluding parking spaces and other units) units, of which 72,380 were residential units, with a portfolio value of €8.9 billion. Prior to the completion of the takeover offer for ADLER Real Estate, all of the real estate that ADLER Group S.A. (formerly ADO Properties S.A.) directly and indirectly owned was located in Berlin, and Berlin continues to represent a significant part of our portfolio. Accordingly, we are extensively dependent on trends in the Berlin residential real estate market, as well as general economic conditions and developments in Berlin. Our performance and the valuation of our properties are dependent on various factors including demographic and cyclicality trends in Berlin, purchasing power of the population, the development of the population, attractiveness of the particular locations of our properties, the unemployment rate and employment offers, infrastructure, social structure, and supply and demand for real estate space and assets in the respective locations and markets in Berlin. As of June 30, 2020, 25.6% of the total number of residential units owned by the ADLER Group are located in Berlin. This could create a disadvantage compared to competitors who have a more geographically diversified real estate portfolio. In particular, the demand for residential real estate is subject to rapid and occasionally unpredictable changes, including as a result of changes to economic conditions, interest rates and business confidence. The effects of any decline in the attractiveness of the Berlin real estate market and of any downturn or illiquidity in the Berlin real estate market could significantly harm our business. In addition, regional economic and political developments, and other trends in the Berlin market, have a significant impact on the demand for our residential real estate and the rents achievable, as well as on the valuation of our properties. Such local developments may differ considerably from overall developments in Germany. For example, the purchasing power of residents of eastern German states lagged behind the purchasing power of the residents of western German states in 2018 and 2019 (source: GfK—Purchasing Power Germany). While some cities and regions in eastern Germany have seen decreasing unemployment rates and growing purchasing power in recent years, there is no guarantee that this trend will continue. Furthermore, we are also affected by the German economic conditions as a whole, such as growth in gross domestic product (“GDP”), unemployment, interest rates, inflation and financing availability.

    Title: Due to the potentially illiquid nature of the real estate market, we may not be able to sell any portion of our portfolio or investments in a timely fashion, on favorable terms or at all.
    Text: We invest in real estate and in real estate companies and while our general strategy is to hold properties that we acquire, we may opportunistically from time to time sell properties or portfolios of properties if attractive opportunities or market conditions arise as well as for strategic reasons. Our ability to sell properties generally depends on the liquidity of the real estate markets at the time of the potential sale. The demand for real estate assets is influenced by, among other factors, the quality of the property, vacancy rates, the overall economic and market situation at the time of the sale, the level of interest rates and the availability of debt financing to market participants. As a result, if we were required to sell parts of our portfolio, particularly on short notice or under legal, financial or time pressure, there is no guarantee that we would be able to do so in a timely fashion or on favorable terms ----- or at all. In the event of a forced sale, for example, if creditors realize collateral, there would likely be a significant shortfall between the fair value of the property or property portfolio in question or the shares in the real estate company, as the case may be, and the price achievable upon the sale of such property or property portfolio or shares in such circumstances, and there can be no guarantee that the price obtained by us would represent a fair or market value for the property or property portfolio or shares. Any of the above factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, net assets, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.

    Title: Existing rent restrictions in connection with the promotion of public authorities and with heat supply contracts could limit the rent levels we may be able to charge.
    Text: Some of the properties that we have acquired are currently or have been subsidized by public authorities, mainly in the form of loans. As a result of such subsidies, certain restrictions are imposed, inter alia, on the maximum rent levels for the properties constructed, acquired or modernized using such subsidies and the eligibility of prospective tenants of publicly subsidized residential space. Such rent levels are significantly below current market rents for a number of rent restricted residential units, and it may be difficult to increase rents to market levels even after the lapse of the period in which subsidy restrictions apply. As of June 30, 2020, 4.2% (by sqm) of our properties were rent-restricted due to subsidies. In the six-month period ended June 30, 2020, rental income from such residential units amounted to €6.0 million (or 3.6% of our total rental income), compared to €2.8 million in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 (or 2.5% of the total rental income for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 (excluding the units sold under the Gewobag Sale (as defined below)). As of June 30, 2020, approximately 29% (by units) of the rent restrictions as a result of subsidies are scheduled to expire by 2022. The subsidies are subject to certain conditions. If we become unable to meet those conditions or violate them, we may have to pay a fine (e.g. in the case of not meeting rent restrictions) or subsidies may even be subject to revocation. In addition, we are subject to certain restrictions relating to heat supply contracting (Nahwärme and Fernwärme). The German Federal Court of Justice (Bundesgerichtshof) has ruled that unless otherwise stipulated in the letting contract, a landlord is not allowed to introduce heat supply contracting without the tenant’s consent. One of the consequences of this ruling is that in some local rent sub-indices in Berlin, the margin by which we can increase the rent for residential units that we let with heat supply contracting has narrowed. Such limitation could ultimately restrict our ability to increase rents for the affected residential units and, ultimately, the profitability of our business activities and our ability to generate rental income in line with our strategy.

    Title: In the future, the geographic and/or asset type composition of our property portfolio may change due to further acquisitions or divestures.
    Text: The geographic distribution of our property portfolio has recently changed and will change in the future. The completion (the “Completion”) of the combination of the business of ADLER Real Estate AG and its consolidated subsidiaries with the business of ADO Properties S.A. (renamed to ADLER Group S.A.) and its consolidated subsidiaries (the “Business Combination”) following the voluntary takeover offer by the Company for all shares in ADLER Real Estate in the form of an exchange offer, as published on February 7, 2020, (the “ADLER Offer”) allowed the Company to consolidate the ADLER Real Estate Group’s property portfolio in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. The geographic distribution of our residential property portfolio as of June 30, 2020 was as follows: Berlin: 19,098 units (49% of GAV), Lower-Saxony: 17,958 (16% of GAV), North Rhine Westphalia: 13,700 units (13% of GAV), Saxony: 9,561 units (9% of GAV) with the remainder located in various other federal states. In addition, we follow an opportunistic approach regarding acquisitions and focus on real estate property that we believe has potential for value increase. Consequently, we continuously seek investment opportunities throughout our key markets and the region of our strategic focus. Additionally, we monitor other markets that we believe may meet our investment criteria. Therefore, acquisition opportunities might arise in markets outside of our key markets. Therefore, the geographical composition of our property portfolio may change further, either as a result of new acquisitions or as a result of divestitures of properties by us, in particular should we shift our strategic focus to new markets. A change in the geographical composition of the property portfolio may lead to increased concentration in certain geographical areas, or introduce or increase dependencies on regional market conditions in new or different geographical areas. These may have different fundamentals, trends or legal, regulatory and tax regimes than the current region where our real estate properties are located. A broader geographical distribution may also result in additional costs in connection with the management of the properties ----- and reduce the benefits of economies of scale. A different geographical distribution of the property portfolio may result in reduced availability of market data, which could limit our ability to accurately predict the performance of our investments.

    Title: Our business could be adversely impacted by negative developments in the economy and in the residential real estate markets in Germany.
    Text: We are active in the residential real estate market and have focused our activities on various residential real estate markets in Germany. As of June 30, 2020, the value of our real estate portfolio was €8.9 billion. In the six-month period ended June 30, 2020, we derived 84.7% of our revenue from rental activities (including facility services). The success of our business therefore significantly depends on the development of the residential real estate market in Germany. The average German disposable income per capita increased from €21,611 in 2016 to €22,899 in 2018 (source: _Volkswirtschaftliche Gesamtrechnung der Länder) and unemployment decreased from 4.1% to 3.4% over the_ same period (source: Federal Statistical Office—Press Release 075), while our weighted average monthly rent for residential properties decreased from €6.42 (per sqm) in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, to €6.20 (per sqm) in the six-month period ended June 30, 2020. Real estate markets, however, are generally susceptible to changes in the overall economy. Consequently, our business is affected by factors affecting the general economic environment, such as interest rates, levels of public debt, GDP, inflation rates and political and financial market conditions, primarily in Germany and our various submarkets. These factors play an important role in determining property values, rent levels, re-letting periods, overall demand, vacancy rates and turnover rates in these markets and submarkets. In addition, local and regional variations of these factors may cause their impact to vary significantly across our residential real estate portfolio. In particular, unemployment in Berlin at 6.1% was above the national average (source: Eurostat—Unemployment). Additionally, the estimated purchasing power per capita was at €21,689 in Berlin in 2019 and therefore below the national average of €23,779 (source: GfK—Purchasing Power Germany). Our business is therefore highly dependent on macroeconomic and political developments, including changes in legislation, as well as other general trends affecting Germany. As an export-driven economy, Germany is particularly affected by the development of the world economy in general and the Eurozone in particular. While unemployment rates in Germany were relatively low in recent years, with 3.3% (as adjusted) in Germany as of December 2018 (source: Federal Statistical Office— _Unemployment), public debt and unemployment levels remain high in many countries in the Eurozone, such as_ Italy, Ireland, Spain, Greece and Portugal, and future economic growth in the Eurozone is threatened by the fragile state of economic recovery in many Eurozone countries. The European and global economies may be impacted by many factors, inter alia, Brexit (as defined below) (see “The withdrawal of the United Kingdom _from the European Union may continue to cause significant political and economic uncertainty in the European Union and in the United Kingdom.”), current geopolitical crises such as in Syria and the Ukraine, the uncertain_ economic prospects in China and other parts of the world, the results of recent and future elections in a number of Eurozone countries (including Germany) and other factors, such as the fluctuation of raw material prices and currency fluctuations. Furthermore, increased trade barriers resulting from the imposition of tariffs could negatively impact the global and regional economies. For example, in June 2018, the U.S. introduced new trade tariffs on certain steel and aluminum products (in addition to imposing punitive tariffs on trade partners such as China, Canada or Mexico). In response, the European Union (the “EU”) introduced retaliatory tariffs on a list of American signature products. Any further escalation of trade disputes could lead to a worsening economic environment or outlook. In addition, strengthening populist movements in a number of EU member states create a risk of further destabilization of the EU and increased economic uncertainty. Such uncertainty and the resulting market volatility may create contagion risks for economically strong countries such as Germany and may spread to the Eurozone or other financial sectors and residential real estate markets. In addition, the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 (the “Coronavirus”), first identified in December 2019, has resulted in a deterioration of the political, socio-economic and financial situation in Germany, and consequently this could have a negative impact on our business. Any widespread health crisis, including the Coronavirus and future pandemics, could result in our tenants being unable to pay their rents when due or at all, adversely affect the fair value of our real estate properties, cause a significant decline of aggregate rent levels in affected areas and, ultimately, affect our ability to access debt and equity capital on attractive terms, or at all. ----- Adverse economic developments and other negative trends in the commercial and residential real estate markets in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business, net assets, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.

Does the text mention that the company is exposed to risks associated with cyclical products?

    Title: Our future growth depends on the availability of real estate properties with value-add potential at reasonable prices, but growing competition and other factors may lead to increased prices and lower availability.
    Text: As part of our business strategy, we seek to acquire residential real estate portfolios. Since January 1, 2017 and as of June 30, 2020, we have acquired 4,650 residential real estate units with a total residential lettable area of 322 thousand sqm, of which 89 were residential units for privatization with a total property size of approximately 4,000 sqm across three properties. Moreover, as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, we have successfully completed the Business Combination with ADLER Real Estate, whose rental properties are mainly located in the German federal states of Lower Saxony, North Rhine-Westphalia, Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt and Brandenburg. Further acquisitions are only feasible, however, if attractive real estate portfolios and properties are available for purchase at reasonable prices. Given the current high demand for residential real estate in Germany, and, in particular, in Berlin, such portfolios and properties may be unavailable or available only on unfavorable terms. Any such development could impair the growth of our business and could prevent us from generating additional economies of scale and strategically developing our portfolio and properties for privatization through acquisitions and investing into our portfolios with attractive returns. Our general ability to sell parts of our real estate portfolio depends on the state of investment markets and on market liquidity or declining real estate values. If we were required to sell parts of our real estate portfolio for the purpose of raising cash to support our operations, to repay debt or for other reasons, there is no guarantee that we would be able to sell such parts of our portfolio on favorable terms or at all. In addition, existing contractual obligations under loan or purchase agreements restrict our ability to sell certain parts of our portfolio. As of June 30, 2020, 4.2% (by sqm) of our residential units were subject to rent restrictions that stem from public subsidies. In the case of a forced sale of all or part of our real estate portfolio, for example if creditors realize collateral, there would likely be a significant shortfall between the price obtained and the carrying amount of the portfolio sold. In addition, a number of factors beyond our control, such as the overall development of real estate markets, construction activity, zoning and planning laws, influence the availability of offices, hotels, logistics/wholesale, retail, and residential properties generally. There is no guarantee that we will be able to continue to identify or acquire a sufficient number of suitable properties at reasonable prices that will allow us to successfully implement our business strategy or grow our business effectively. The supply of real estate properties and portfolios available for sale may also be reduced due to fewer sales by private or public sellers. If for instance state-owned entities reduce or cease privatizing or selling their real estate holdings, as they have done over the past years, then supply, in particular for residential real estate, could be reduced, which may result in increased competition for acquisitions of suitable properties and may motivate potential sellers to sell properties through an auction process. The use of auction processes for the sale of properties has become increasingly common and may increase in the future. Any of these factors may result in increased prices for the types of properties which are our strategic focus. As a result, it could be more difficult for us to successfully acquire properties, which could limit our ability to grow our businesses effectively. We are exposed to competition from national and international investors in the markets in which we operate. We compete to acquire attractive properties with other investors, such as international real estate funds, German open-ended and closed-ended funds and publicly listed German real estate companies, any of which may have greater resources, better information or better access to properties or financial resources and lower costs of capital than we do. We also compete with other property companies, investment funds, institutional investors, building contractors, individual owners and other entities to attract and retain suitable tenants on favorable terms. Competition in the real estate markets we target is generally intense and could further intensify in the future. There is no guarantee that we will be able to successfully compete in any of the regions within our strategic focus or will be able to enter new regions successfully. Changes in law or regulation may also create environments in which we can no longer effectively compete. In the future, increased competition could also require us to change our business strategy in part or in whole and could affect our ability to generate sufficient income. There is significant competition among potential acquirers in the German residential real estate market, ----- and there can be no assurance that we will be able to implement our growth strategy or to successfully complete acquisitions. Any inability to adequately react to regional real estate markets and their developments could jeopardize our efforts, business activities and strategic goals, including our strategy to capture external growth opportunities.

Does the text mention that the company is exposed to risks associated with cyclical products?

    Title: We are exposed to certain risks in connection with construction projects, including construction defects, availability of contractors, cost-overruns as well as health, safety and environmental risks.
    Text: With respect to the construction of our residential development projects, we are exposed to various risks relating to defective construction work or the use or installation of defective construction materials by third-party suppliers or contractors. The warranty, guarantee or indemnity protection set forth in our contracts with such third-party suppliers and contractors, and the arrangements with insurance providers to insure against certain risks, may prove to be insufficient or may not adequately protect us against relevant risks. Furthermore, we may not be able to enforce claims in the respective amount, or at all, due to the third-party contractor’s or supplier’s insolvency or for other reasons. Significant liabilities may not be identified or may only come to light after the expiry of our warranty, guarantee or indemnity claims. Any claims relating to defects arising from or related to one of our residential development projects may give rise to contractual or other liabilities, which can extend, depending on the relevant contractual or statutory provisions, for five years following completion of the development project and may not be covered by claims against our contractors or suppliers. Moreover, our ability to successfully complete our development projects on time, at the anticipated quality or at all, depends on the availability of contractors, service providers or sub-contractors. We may fail to meet standards and/or deadlines agreed with contractors and service providers and there can be no assurance that we will be able to hire qualified and reliable contractors. Contractors and service providers may be adversely affected by economic downturns, insolvencies or any other risks inherent to the provision of any such services as well as force majeure incidents such as the Coronavirus. These risks include damages caused by severe weather conditions (e.g., fires, floods or natural disasters) and construction-related delays due to personnel shortages, strikes, building site safety, governmental permits, adverse weather conditions, shortage of or inability to source building materials and transportation issues, any of which may be influenced by the respective parties’ reliance on third parties. Among others, any of the aforementioned risks may result in significant cost overruns and project delays. Furthermore, we are exposed to cost increases in connection with services of contractors, service providers and sub-contractors. Any cost increases could adversely affect our ability to earn the projected yields related to our residential development projects. Developing real estate entails certain health, safety, and environmental (“HSE”) related risks. A significant HSE incident at one of our development projects or a general deterioration in our HSE standards could put our employees, contractors or the general public at risk of injury or death and could lead to litigation, significant penalties or damage to our reputation. We may be liable for the costs of removal, investigation or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances (including asbestos) located on, under or in a property currently or formerly owned by us, whether or not we caused or knew of it. Furthermore, we may also be deemed to be responsible for latent or historic risks from unknown contamination, or may incur greater liability or costs than originally anticipated. The costs of remediation, investigation or defending against claims can be substantial, and they may not be covered by warranties and indemnities from the seller of the affected land plot or property or by our insurance policies, or may prove unenforceable. Any failure in HSE performance, including any delay in responding to changes in HSE regulations, may result in penalties for non-compliance with relevant regulatory requirements. Monitoring and ensuring HSE best practices may become increasingly expensive for us in the future if additional HSE requirements were to come into effect.

Does the text mention that the company is exposed to risks associated with cyclical products?

    Title: An increase in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on the real estate markets in which we operate.
    Text: One of the tools used by governments and central banks to support economic development over the last ten years was a lowering of interest rates. While low interest rates have generally not led to the desired levels of inflation, they have benefitted the Eurozone economies and supported demand for real estate, including commercial and residential real estate, due to the resulting availability of inexpensive financing. The benign interest rate environment has also had a positive impact on real estate valuations, as it tends to result in an increase of the value of future cash flows. Should overall economic growth accelerate, however, the European Central Bank could become more vigilant with regard to inflationary pressures and begin a cycle of monetary tightening, including through progressive increases in base interest rates, particularly if this growth leads to a ----- tightening of the labor market. This could lead to a rise in interest rates in Germany and throughout the Eurozone and could result in increased investor interest in investments with a higher risk profile and a decrease in the attractiveness of real estate investments, resulting in lower demand for real estate and broad declines in real estate valuations, among other effects. An increase in interest rates could adversely impact our business in a number of ways, including the willingness of potential purchasers to acquire real estate in an environment of rising interest rates may be negatively affected, thereby restricting our ability to dispose of our properties on favorable terms when desired. Most purchasers finance their acquisitions with lender provided financing through mortgages and comparable security (in Germany so called land-charges). Lack of availability of such financing at attractive rates could therefore reduce demand for properties.

    Title: In connection with certain acquisitions, we have entered into contractual obligations that restrict our ability to freely divest parts of our portfolio or to increase rents for certain units or to rent to tenants not eligible for subsidized housing, and thereby potentially prevent us from extracting the maximum value from the affected properties.
    Text: Residential real estate transactions often include contractual clauses that restrict a buyer’s right to divest the acquired portfolio or increase rent on the acquired residential units. Furthermore, sellers often restrict the buyer’s right to terminate existing leases, which reduces the attractiveness of the affected units for prospective purchasers. The aforementioned restrictions are especially common in connection with the privatization of publicly-owned properties, where the selling public authorities often intend to mitigate potential social effects of such transactions, or when these portfolios are subsequently sold on to third parties. Usually, most obligations lapse in full or in part after a certain period of time. As of June 30, 2020, 4.2% (by sqm) of our residential units, with a total of 184,338 sqm of residential area, which accounted for 3.9% of the rental income generated over the six-month period ended June 30, 2020, were subject to certain contractual restrictions, including multiple restrictions or obligations. These limitations include in particular: - restrictions on sales; - preferential subscription rights; - restrictions on the termination of lease agreements; - restrictions on permitted use; and - restrictions on rent increases. In addition to these contractual obligations entered into in connection with acquisitions, we have acquired properties that have received subsidies from public authorities which restrict the level of rents chargeable on a part of our portfolio. For more information, see “Existing rent restrictions in connection with the promotion of _public authorities and with heat supply contracts could limit the rent levels we may be able to charge.”_ The aforementioned restrictions may limit our ability to attractively market parts or all of our portfolio, which in turn could potentially restrain our ability to capitalize on business opportunities, to pass up opportunities for streamlining and generate profit. They could thereby lower the overall value of our property portfolio and limit our ability to generate cash flow from selective divestitures and have a material adverse effect on our business, net assets, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.

    Title: While we employ and work together with a large number of service providers, on whose performance we are dependent, we also have an integrated platform for active asset management and privatizations, which increases our personnel expenses and other fixed costs and may impose limitations to a more flexible business approach as compared to competitors that outsource these services.
    Text: We have implemented a multi-facetted human resource approach to enable flexible management of service volumes by contracting with a large numbers of service providers and to, at the same time, retain key business competences within the portfolio management by means of our integrated active asset management and privatization platform. We employ and work together with a large number of service providers, including energy providers, providers of minor repairs and maintenance services and construction companies and therefore are dependent on their performance. In connection therewith, we incurred costs of approximately €74.7 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2020. Such services may not be rendered in a timely manner or their quality may not ----- comply with our requirements, regulatory framework or stipulations included in the service contracts. Moreover, certain contractors may experience operational or financial issues and certain services may become unavailable to us as a result thereof. Any failures by contractors to deliver in accordance with their contractual obligations may result in delays and additional expenses for us. Since 2007, we have operated a fully integrated platform whereby we use our own personnel for key functions from portfolio management to modernization and privatization. In 2013, we added facility management to our platform. For these purposes, we have our own business areas of asset and portfolio management, property and facility management, and construction management. We employed approximately 1,120 employees (full-time equivalent) (“FTE”) as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, of which approximately 10 FTE, 1,030 FTE and 80 FTE were assigned to the areas of asset and portfolio management, property and facility management, and construction management, respectively. As further acquisitions take place, we may increase the number of personnel in the future. In addition, we have entered into agreements with third parties for providing additional asset management and further services in order to benefit from their expertise and support in the respective areas. Our ability to manage our operations and growth requires the continuous improvement of operational, financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures. If, as a result of business or economic conditions, we were forced to scale down our business operations, it would be substantially more difficult and costly for us to reduce our headcount than to reduce the services provided by third-party contractors. Despite the existing quality control procedures, the quality of services rendered by our own employees could fall below the level of services performed by third-party contractors and reduce the attractiveness of our properties. Since some of these tasks are performed internally, we may not be in a position to claim compensation for damages from third parties for non-performance or improper performance. Moreover, if services rendered by our employees are not performed as scheduled or in a timely manner, or if the quality of work or the delayed execution of our work falls below applicable standards, we may face claims from our tenants, including rent reductions and additional compensations, or may not be in a position to re-let vacant units that require maintenance and modernization before new tenants can move in. In addition, in the course of rendering services, our employees, third-party suppliers, tenants or other individuals may be injured which, ultimately, exposes us to liability risks in relation thereto. If the services from third-party providers are not performed in accordance with their contractual obligations or services, including those rendered by personnel of our integrated platform for portfolio management and privatization, are not performed as scheduled or if the quality of work falls below applicable standards, we may face claims from our tenants or from purchasers of individual residential units and may be exposed to delays and additional expenses, and ultimately not be in a position to re-let vacant units that require maintenance and modernization before new tenants or purchasers can move in. Any failure to efficiently implement our multi-facetted human resource approach may result in delays, additional expenses, the general failure to be in a position to make apartments available to tenants or purchasers on time, if at all, which could lead to liability claims.

    Title: Our property portfolio contains some commercial units, which are subject to different risks than our residential rental units.
    Text: As of June 30, 2020, 3.1% of our properties contain a total of 2,302 commercial units with a total lettable area of 268,938 sqm, which also includes 16 purely commercial properties with a cumulative lettable commercial area of 20,905 sqm. The commercial portion of our portfolio accounted for 8.0% of our rental income as of June 30, 2020 (compared to approximately 7.6% of our rental income as of December 31, 2019). Our commercial units compete with other commercial properties in the neighborhood, demand for such units is siteand location-specific, which may result in narrower demand relative to residential units and may lead to prolonged or permanent vacancies. In terms of rent, the risk is more concentrated as lease contracts are usually made for higher amounts than for residential units. In addition, the re-letting of a commercial unit generally takes longer than the re-letting of a residential unit. Also, in the event of an economic crisis the demand for commercial units is adversely affected quicker than the demand for residential units. Finally, any vacant commercial unit, or a leased commercial unit that conducts a dubious type of business, within our residential properties may in turn negatively impact our ability to retain residential tenants or locate new residential tenants for that property. -----

    Title: We are exposed to risks related to the structural condition of our properties and their maintenance, repair and modernization.
    Text: In order to sustain demand for a rental property and to generate adequate revenue through rental income over the long-term, a property’s condition must be maintained, repaired and/or improved to a standard that meets market demand and complies with environmental and building laws and extensive regulations (see “Our _business is subject to the general legal environment in Germany. Any disadvantageous changes in the legal environment, such as mandatory environmental modernization provisions, restrictions regarding modernization measures or provisions (including taxes) that result in the incurrence of costs in the event of a property sale, or disadvantageous changes to the Berlin Mietspiegel regulation, may be detrimental to us.”). Typically, the costs_ associated with maintaining a rental property at market standards are borne primarily by the property owner. As maintenance, repair and modernization are required to comply with changing legal or market requirements (e.g. with regard to energy saving), we may be burdened with substantial additional expenses. In Germany, rent increases to compensate for these expenses may only be introduced under certain conditions and rent increases for all modernization projects announced as from January 1, 2019 must not exceed 8% of the total costs incurred in connection with the modernization measures and are capped at €3.0 per square meter within six years, or if the rent is less than €7.0 per square meter the rent may only increase by €2.0 per sqm within six years. In addition, we may not be able to increase rents to the extent legally permissible as a result of prevailing market conditions or the inability of tenants receiving social welfare (Arbeitslosengeld II, Hartz IV) and housing subsidies (Wohngeld), as is the case for a part of our tenants, to afford these increased rents or otherwise. During the six-month period ended June 30, 2020, our maintenance and capital expenditures – on average – amounted to €11.5 per sqm to our overall portfolios, amounting to total costs of approximately €55.8 million in that period. During the six-month period ended June 30, 2019 these expenditures averaged €23.3 per sqm. In comparison, our average maintenance and capital expenditures for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 amounted to €36.2 per sqm (corresponding to total costs of approximately €58.7 million during that period), which was a decrease compared to average maintenance and capital expenditures of €39.2 per sqm incurred during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. Although we constantly review the condition of our properties and have established a reporting system to monitor and budget the necessary maintenance, repair and modernization measures, numerous factors may generate substantial cost overruns or unexpected increases in costs for maintenance, repairs and modernization. These factors, which may include the material and substances used at the time of construction, currently unknown building code violations, the age of the relevant building and/or any inability to process damage reports in a timely manner, could result in substantial unbudgeted costs for refurbishment, repairs, modernization, damages arising from the delayed execution or non-execution of repairs and/or maintenance measures, decontamination required to remove and dispose of any hazardous materials (e.g. asbestos) which are harmful to the health of the residents, or other maintenance or upgrade work. 66.7% of our residential units were built between 1950 and 2013 and 32.9% were built prior to 1950 (calculated on the basis of the fair value of our residential units as of June 30, 2020). We would incur additional and unexpected costs if the actual costs of maintaining or modernizing our properties were to exceed currently recognized cost levels, if we are not permitted to raise rents in connection with maintenance and modernization due to statutory or contractual constraints, or if hidden defects that are not covered by insurance or contractual warranties are discovered during the maintenance or modernization processes. Moreover, due to the current Berlin rent freeze (Mietendeckel), we have significantly decreased our maintenance and capital expenditure in relation to our property portfolio located in Berlin, which could, in the future, weaken the structural condition of our residential properties at that location. Any failure to undertake appropriate maintenance and modernization work at all or on economically reasonable terms in response to the factors described above could adversely affect the rental income earned from affected properties. Such failures could entitle tenants to withhold or reduce rental payments or even to terminate existing letting contracts.

    Title: We may be unable to find or retain suitable tenants on acceptable terms, and existing tenants may be unable to meet their payment obligations.
    Text: The letting of real estate is the most important aspect of our business as we generated 84.7% of our revenue from rental activities (including facility services) in the six-month period ended June 30, 2020. Our rental income depends on, _inter alia, our ability to let our properties at profitable rent levels. Such efforts are influenced by a number of factors, including the remaining term of existing lease agreements, the commercial ----- conditions of current tenants and the attractiveness of residential real estate units for new or existing tenants. We may be unable to renew expiring lease agreements on acceptable terms or to find suitable tenants willing to enter into new lease agreements. There is also no guarantee that we will be able to successfully compete for suitable tenants with other landlords, who may be able to offer more attractive properties, lease terms and/or rent levels. If we misjudge the current or future attractiveness of our properties, it may be difficult to find suitable tenants that are willing to rent our properties at the rent levels or for the time periods anticipated by us. To a lesser extent, the same applies to our ability to let our commercial real estate properties which, in the six-month period ended June 30, 2020, generated 8.0% of our rental income (compared to 7.6% in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019). Failure to find and retain suitable tenants may prevent us from maintaining our current vacancy rate or letting vacant space, or may force us to reduce the rent levels to demands from current and future tenants. In addition, the financial capacity or creditworthiness of our tenants may deteriorate over time, reducing their ability to make payments under their leases on time or at all. Reductions in tenants’ abilities to make payments under their leases may force us to reduce rent levels for the relevant properties, resulting in rental income that is significantly lower than originally estimated, while our operating and financing costs might remain largely fixed or even increase. We may also be forced to engage in expensive and time-consuming administrative or legal proceedings in order to evict certain defaulting tenants. Further, insolvency or other restructuring activities undertaken by our tenants, with or without our consent, may result in modifications to the terms of our leases. Although we do not consider any single rental agreement to be material to our position, we take steps to verify the financial capacity of our tenants prior to entering into leases with them and, as such steps may not always be adequate or may not reveal undisclosed problems with such tenant’s financial capacity. Ultimately, however, we may enter into a significant number of rental agreements on the basis of inadequate verification processes that could, in turn, collectively have a materially adverse impact on us as a whole. In addition, we cannot predict the financial stability of our tenants going forward and we may ultimately be exposed to the risk of cumulative financial instability of a significant number of our tenants.

    Title: Damage to our reputation and any reduced tenant satisfaction may result in reduced demand for our residential units and may make it more difficult for us to raise capital on favorable terms or at all.
    Text: If we are unable to maintain our reputation and high level of customer service, tenant satisfaction and demand for our services and properties could suffer. In particular, harm to our reputation could make it more difficult for us to let our residential units and could lead to delays in rental payments or the termination of rental contracts by our tenants. Any reputational damage due to our inability to meet customer service expectations could consequently limit our ability to retain existing and attract new tenants. Furthermore, harm to our reputation could impair our ability to raise capital on favorable terms or at all. Any downturn in tenant satisfaction, demand for our services and properties and any damage to our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our business, net assets, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.

    Title: Our information technology systems could malfunction or fail.
    Text: Our information technology systems are essential for our business operations and success. Any interruptions in, failures of, or damage to our information technology systems or our voice-over-internet-protocol telephony system could lead to delays or interruptions in our business processes such as the outage of our customer service or rental hotlines. In addition, we outsource some of our information technology services. Any interruptions or failures by the provider of such services could lead to business process delays and negatively affect our information technology system. In particular, our information technology systems may be vulnerable to security breaches and cyber-attacks from unauthorized persons outside and within the ADLER Group. Any malfunction or impairment of our computer systems could interrupt our operations, lead to increased costs and may result in lost revenue. We cannot guarantee that anticipated and/or recognized malfunctions can be avoided by appropriate preventive security measures in every case. The integration of newly acquired portfolios into our information technology systems presents further risks. If our information technology system and/or backups were to fail, we would have to recreate existing databases, which would be time-consuming and expensive. We may also have to expend additional funds and resources to protect against or to remedy potential or existing security breaches and related consequences. If information technology services provided by service providers were interrupted or were to fail, we possibly might not be able to cover the damages suffered due to reasons including liability limitations or insolvency of the service provider. ----- In addition, due to the constant development of information technology we might decide to outsource further information technology services or replace a current information technology service provider. If we had to engage a new or replace one of our current information technology service providers, a migration of information technology services would tie up resources that cannot be deployed elsewhere. Such a migration would likely incur substantial costs and potential interruptions in our business processes as well as potential losses of data and could have a material adverse effect on our business, net assets, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.

    Title: The withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union may continue to cause significant political and economic uncertainty in the European Union and in the United Kingdom.
    Text: The ongoing political situation surrounding the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the EU (“Brexit”) is partially characterized by rapid developments and unexpected change. The final consequences of Brexit are impossible to predict. The member states of the EU will face greater barriers to trade and commerce with the United Kingdom, which may in turn diminish overall economic activity between the EU and the United Kingdom, resulting in a general economic downturn. The uncertain consequences of Brexit have already caused additional volatility in the financial markets. Since we rely on access to the financial markets in order to refinance our debt liabilities and gain access to new financing, ongoing political uncertainty and any worsening of the economic environment may reduce our ability to refinance our existing and future liabilities or gain access to new financing, in each case on favorable terms or at all. Furthermore, our counterparties, in particular our hedging counterparties, may not be able to fulfil their obligations under their respective agreements due to a lack of liquidity, operational failure, bankruptcy or other reasons. Any of the above factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, net assets, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.

    Title: Property valuation is inherently subjective and is based on assumptions that may prove to be inaccurate or affected by factors outside of our control. The property valuation serves as a basis of and is combined with other factors for our fair value model, which ultimately could require write-down revisions of the current fair values of our investment properties.
    Text: Property assets are inherently difficult to value due to their lack of homogeneity and liquidity. The ADLER Group records investment properties at fair value, which is the price that would be received when selling an asset or transferring a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The investment properties of the ADLER Group are appraised as of June 30 and December 31 of each year. The fair value of the investment properties of the ADLER Group (without the ADLER Real Estate Group) as of June 30, 2020 was determined based on valuations as of June 30, 2020 undertaken by the external valuer (as defined by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, RICS Valuation – Professional Standards 2020) CBRE ----- GmbH (“CBRE”). According thereto, as of June 30, 2020, the property value of the investment properties of the ADLER Group (without the ADLER Real Estate Group) was €3.7 billion. The properties owned by the ADLER Real Estate Group generally undergo a detailed valuation as of June 30 and December 31 of each year. The fair value of certain residential rental units owned by the ADLER Real Estate Group, without the residential units of Brack German Properties B.V., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Brack Capital Properties N.V. (“BCP”), in which ADLER Real Estate holds a 69.81% stake as of June 30, 2020, was determined based on valuations as of June 30, 2020, undertaken by CBRE. According thereto, as of June 30, 2020, the fair value of these residential rental units was €3.6 billion. Furthermore, the fair value of the residential rental units of BCP, in which ADLER Real Estate holds a 69.81% stake as of June 30, 2020, was determined based on valuations as of June 30, 2020, undertaken by CBRE. According thereto, as of June 30, 2020, the fair value of these residential rental units was €1.1 billion. Moreover, the fair value of the development projects of the ADLER Real Estate Group as of June 30, 2020 was determined based on valuations as of June 30, 2020, undertaken by the external valuer (as defined by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, RICS Valuation – Professional Standards 2020) apollo valuation & research GmbH (“NAI Apollo”). According thereto, as of June 30, 2020, the fair value of the development projects owned by the ADLER Real Estate Group was €0.1 billion.

    Title: In the event of a downturn or other developments in the real estate markets in Germany or a downturn in the interest rate environment, the fair values of the properties in our property portfolio may decline, which could materially impact the valuation of our property portfolio.
    Text: We account for our real estate properties at fair value. The valuation model is predominantly based on the present value of net cash flows to be generated from the property in question, taking into account expected rental growth rates, vacancy periods, occupancy rates, lease incentive costs such as rent-free periods and other costs not paid by tenants, as well as capex and maintenance expenses related to the property. In specific cases the appraisers use special assumptions, assuming facts that differ from the actual facts existing at the valuation date or that would not be made by a typical market participant in a transaction on the valuation date. The expected net cash flows are discounted using risk-adjusted discount rates. Among other factors, the discount rate estimation considers the quality of a building and its location, tenant credit quality, lease duration and terms, and the interest rate environment. Due to the current Berlin rent freeze (Mietendeckel), we have significantly decreased our maintenance and capital expenditure in relation to our property portfolio located in Berlin, which could lead to higher capex and maintenance expenses in the future in order to safeguard or reestablish the quality of the affected properties and could lead to a decrease of the fair value of our Berlin property portfolio. Establishing the valuation parameters involves substantial judgment and such judgments may prove to be inaccurate. In addition, any change to valuation methodology, including as a result of changes to the statutory requirements, may result in gains or losses in our financial statements, based on the change to each property’s valuation compared with prior valuations. There can be no assurance that any particular valuation could be realized in a third-party sale. When evaluating our properties, we engage third-party appraisers. The valuations given to properties by thirdparty appraisers and reflected in our financial statements and in this Offering Memorandum may exceed or be below the actual amount of net proceeds which would be realized on the relevant property at the time of any sale, and are subject to fluctuation over time. Such variations may be driven by factors outside of our control and we may not be able to realize the full property value reflected in any valuation report. The fair value determination also reflects not only the circumstances directly connected with the property but also the general conditions of the real estate markets, such as regional market developments and general economic conditions or interest rate levels. Accordingly, there is a risk that in the event of a downturn in the real estate market where the property is located or in the general economic situation, we will need to revise downward the value of our portfolio. In addition, rising interest rates generally may have a negative influence on the fair value of property portfolios, and may impact the value of our real estate portfolio (see “We are _exposed to certain risks in connection with construction projects, including construction defects, availability of contractors, cost-overruns as well as health, safety and environmental risks.”)._ Any change in fair value must be recognized as a profit or loss under the fair value adjustment. Any significant negative fair value adjustments that we are required to make could therefore have significant adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations, as well as the market price of the Notes. Additionally, there would be negative effects on certain performance indicators, particularly with respect to net asset value ----- (“NAV”) and our loan-to-value ratio (“LTV Ratio”), which may have a negative influence on the credit rating of the Company and may constitute a covenant breach under certain financing agreements or debt securities.

    Title: An increase in general interest rate levels may increase our financing costs, while the current economic environment, characterized by relatively high values of our properties and the prices at which we are able to sell our properties, may decrease.
    Text: The total amount of our net financial liabilities (calculated as financial liabilities less cash and cash equivalents) was €4,970 million as of June 30, 2020. As of the same date, the average interest rate payable for the total amount of our financial liabilities was at 1.8% and the weighted average maturity term was 3.7 years. Furthermore, as of June 30, 2020, the total amount of Consus Real Estate’s net financial liabilities was €2,617 million. Our business model is also based on leveraging our properties. When concluding financing agreements or extending such agreements, we depend on our ability to agree on terms and conditions pertaining to interest payments that will not impair our targeted profit, and to amortization schedules that do not restrict our ability to pay intended dividends. As of June 30, 2020, more than half of our outstanding financing arrangements expire in or after 2023. As of the same date, €731 million of Consus Real Estate’s outstanding financing arrangements expire in or after 2023. Currently, the European Central Bank’s lead rate is at a historic low, thus favorably impacting interest rates charged by banks. This trend, however, may reverse itself, resulting in an increase in both interest rates and financing costs. The global financial and economic crisis has resulted in increased uncertainty regarding future economic developments. This uncertainty regarding the general economic outlook has increased the popularity of investment opportunities that provide stable and largely predictable cash flows, such as investments in German residential real estate, especially in the current low-interest rate environment. The resulting increased popularity of investments in residential real estate has resulted in an increase in property prices and the value of residential real estate companies. These developments could reverse themselves if, for example, interest rates were to rise, which could adversely impact us in a number of ways. For example, the Fair Value recorded on the Company’s balance sheet in accordance with International Accounting Standard (“IAS”) 40 in conjunction with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (“IFRS”) 13 tends to increase in an environment of rising interest rates, which in turn could result in our properties having a lower Fair Value. Given our dependence on our ability to access financial markets for the refinancing of our debt liabilities and the access to equity financings to expand our business model, the continued instability or a further deterioration of the economic environment or the capital markets in some Eurozone countries may reduce our ability to refinance our existing and future liabilities. Furthermore, our counterparties, in particular our hedging counterparties, may not be able to fulfill their obligations under the respective agreements due to a lack of liquidity, operational failure, bankruptcy or other reasons (see “When we attempt to mitigate interest rate risk _by entering into hedging agreements, we also become exposed to the risks associated with the valuation of hedging instruments and hedge counterparties and the hedging agreements may not be effective.”)._ Our ability to refinance existing financing agreements on economically reasonable terms is, among others, affected by changes in the general economic environment, increases in interest rates and decreases in prices at which we are able to sell our properties.

    Title: A downgrade or a withdrawal of the Company’s current credit rating may impact our ability to obtain financing or issue further equity or debt and may have a negative impact on our debt costs and on the market price of the Notes.
    Text: As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, the Company is assigned a long-term issuer credit rating of “BB” with a stable outlook by Standard & Poor’s Global Ratings Europe Ltd. (“S&P”) and a “Ba2” rating with a stable outlook by Moody’s Investors Service Ltd. (“Moody’s”). Consus Real Estate is assigned a long-term issuer credit rating of “B-” with a stable outlook by S&P and a “B-” rating with a stable outlook by Fitch Ratings Ltd. The credit ratings of the Company may be downgraded or withdrawn in the future as a result of the Consus Real Estate Acquisition (as defined below) or factors that are beyond our control, such as a deterioration in the real estate or financial markets, or weakened financial performance by us, or future exposure to the development business, which is characterized by increased capital expenditure and leveraged financial profiles. The Consus Real Estate Acquisition (as defined below) could lead to a lower assessment of the creditworthiness of the ----- Company in the event of a new review of the Company’s current credit rating, which in turn could result in a downgrade or a withdrawal of the credit rating. Any negative change in the credit rating of the Company may make future financings and debt issuances by us more difficult and expensive, and may require us to, among other things, pay higher interest rates and/or provide increased collateral or other security if they are able to access additional financing at all. A downgrade or withdrawal of the credit ratings of the Company may also result in a breach of certain financial covenants in their respective credit lines, financing arrangements and/or debt issuances, and may have a material adverse effect on our businesses. A downgrade or withdrawal of the credit ratings of the Company may also result in a significant decline in the market price of the Notes. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization.

    Title: We have a substantial level of debt and are dependent on refinancing significant amounts as they become due and we may not be able to extend our existing credit arrangements, refinance our debt on substantially similar terms when it matures or obtain acquisition financing on financially attractive terms when needed.
    Text: As of June 30, 2020, we had €4,970 million of outstanding net financial liabilities (calculated as financial liabilities less cash and cash equivalents). As of the same date, the total of our existing financial liabilities amounted to €5,884 million with an average interest rate of 1.8%. As of the same date, €2,546 million of this amount was due until the end of 2022, €1,824 million between 2023 and the end of 2024, and €1,626 million from 2025. As of the date of the Offering Memorandum, €620,267,229 are drawn under the Bridge Facility (as defined below). Additionally, on July 29, 2020, the Company issued €400 million 3.25% fixed rate senior unsecured notes maturing on August 5, 2020. Furthermore, as of June 30, 2020, Consus Real Estate’s total existing net financial liabilities amounted to €2,617 million and, as of the same date, €1,989 million of this was due until the end of 2022, €725 million between 2023 and the end of 2024, and €6 million only from 2025. We are currently negotiating various debt maturity extensions and any failure to achieve such extensions could require us to seek other financing sources. We may also require additional capital to finance or refinance our debt, capital expenditures, future acquisitions and working capital requirements. In order to undertake our planned programs such as refurbishment, and to acquire further real estate portfolios, we will likewise need to borrow additional funds or to raise additional equity capital. The extent of our future capital requirements will depend on many factors which are beyond our control, and our ability to meet such capital requirements will depend on future operating performance and ability to generate cash flows. Additional sources of financing may include equity, hybrid debt/equity and debt financings or other arrangements. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms, or at all, when required. If we do not generate sufficient cash flows or if we are unable to obtain sufficient funds from future equity or debt financings or at acceptable interest rates, we may not be able to pay our debts when due or to fund other liquidity needs which would severely limit our operating flexibility.

    Title: Our level of debt, the terms of current and future borrowings, and the hedging transactions we have entered into, or will enter into in the future, could significantly constrain our operations and could make it more difficult or expensive to obtain new sources of financing without breaching financial covenants.
    Text: In the past, we incurred debt in the form of bonds and/or loans to refinance existing obligations, as well as to finance acquisitions, and we intend to continue to do so in the future. As of June 30, 2020, the total of our existing financial liabilities amounted to €5,884 million with an average interest rate of 1.8%. As of the same date, €2,456 million of this amount was due until the end of 2022, €1,824 million between 2023 and the end of 2024, and €1,626 million only from 2025. Furthermore, as of June 30, 2020, Consus Real Estate’s total existing net financial liabilities amounted to €2,617 million. As of June 30, 2020, our LTV-Ratio was 53.5%, compared to a LTV-Ratio of 38.0% as of June 30, 2019, with the increase mainly attributable to adjustments as a result of the sale of approximately 5,900 residential apartments to GEWOBAG Wohnungsbau-Aktiengesellschaft Berlin (the “Gewobag Sale”) and the first-time consolidation of ADLER Real Estate. Consus Real Estate’s pro forma net LTV ratio (i.e. the ratio of net debt to value of real estate assets as adjusted for certain divestments) was 83.0% as of June 30, 2020 and its net LTV ratio (i.e. the ratio of net debt to value of real estate assets) was 84.0% as of June 30, 2019. Our ability to refinance financial obligations by taking on new debt or extending existing loans could be impeded as a result of our level of debt, changes to refinancing conditions or the general market environment that is impacted by the Coronavirus. Although not currently the case, our level of debt could lead banks to refuse to grant new loans, to make new loans available to us only on less favorable financial ----- terms, to refuse to extend existing credit lines, to extend them only on less favorable terms or to require additional security. Our existing debt facilities require compliance with certain financial and maintenance covenants, some of which require us not to exceed a certain maximum loan-to-value and/or require us to maintain a minimum debt service coverage ratio. Our failure to comply with such covenants could trigger the respective creditor’s right to terminate the relevant financing arrangement or require us to repay part of our debt to cure a breach in the covenants or may lead to higher interest payments. Various loans that the Company’s subsidiaries obtain are secured by mortgages on real estate owned by us. Although we seek to obtain mortgages securing indebtedness which encumber only the particular real estate to which the indebtedness relates, certain loans may be collateralized by other real estate as well. If recourse on any loan incurred to acquire or refinance any particular property includes other properties, the equity in such other real estate could be reduced or eliminated through foreclosure on the relevant loan. If a loan is secured by a mortgage on a single property, we could lose that property through foreclosure if we default on that loan. If we were to default on a loan, we could become involved in litigation related to matters concerning the loan, and such litigation could result in significant costs. Certain situations or events allow our creditors to terminate certain debt facilities even without a breach of covenant, for example, if our economic situation is adversely affected. Any such event could cause all debt outstanding under the relevant facility to become immediately due and payable, and there could be cross defaults under other financing agreements, for example, due to an event of default under another financing agreement or the non-payment of amounts due and payable. If we are forced to repay one or more of our financial obligations early or on short notice, whether due to default, cross default, or otherwise, we might be unable to do so, we might be able to do so only by refinancing on significantly less favorable economic terms or we may be forced to sell some or all of the assets comprising our real estate portfolio. In addition, as of June 30, 2020, 54.0% of our assets served as collateral to our lenders to secure our financial obligations. Creditors might also be able to seize significant amounts of the assets that we have pledged as collateral under certain of these financing agreements.

However, our insurance policies are subject to exclusions and limitations of liability, including with respect to losses resulting from damages from mining, nuclear power or war. We may, therefore, have no coverage for losses that are excluded and limited coverage for losses that exceed the respective coverage limitations. In addition, our insurance providers could become insolvent. Should an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of our insurance limitations occur, we could lose capital invested in the affected property as well as anticipated income and capital appreciation from that property. Moreover, we may incur further costs to repair damage caused by uninsured risks. We could also be held liable for any debt or other financial obligation related to such a property and thus may experience material losses in excess of insurance proceeds. Any of the above factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, net assets, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.

    Title: The Company’s cash flows and possible future dividend payments are dependent on the distributable capital and annual profit and profitability of its subsidiaries or must be augmented by borrowed capital.
    Text: The Company is a holding company and does not conduct its operating business itself but does so through its subsidiaries. To cover the Company’s operating costs, it relies on, among other things, distributions that it receives from its subsidiaries and other investment interests or, as the case may be, scheduled repayments of loans it has granted to its subsidiaries. The distributions by its subsidiaries depend, in-turn, on the subsidiaries’ operating results and their ability to make those distributions under applicable law and potential restrictions of existing and future loan contracts, including the consent of banks to the distribution of surplus cash or the repayment of shareholder loans. Such funds, and the ability to source cash from subsidiaries, may not be sufficient in the future to satisfy all of its payment obligations. If the funds are insufficient, the Company would need to obtain additional funds to be able to pay dividends. ----- Additionally, the Company requires sufficient distributable results and/or distributable reserves in order to be able to pay out a dividend. In principle, the Company intends to pay out a dividend in the amount of up to 50% of FFO 1. The lack of distributable results and/or distributable reserves may hinder the payment of a dividend even if there is sufficient cash to cover a potential dividend payment. Negative developments in connection with any such factors or at the level of each subsidiary, including any impairment of the ability by such subsidiary to continue making distributions of cash to the Company, could force it to sell properties or borrow money on unfavorable terms. We will most likely refrain from paying dividends if available cash is insufficient for the payment thereof. However, any decision to borrow money to facilitate paying dividends could, while in the short-term potentially strengthen the Company’s position among shareholders, result in increased financial obligations over the long run.

    Title: We bear risks in connection with greater indebtedness and higher interest expenses.
    Text: Any acquisition of additional properties could be financed by taking on additional debt or by issuing new shares or by a combination thereof. If we are unable to obtain the necessary financing on reasonable terms, we may be unable to make further acquisitions or may be able to do so only to a limited extent. We may take on a significant amount of additional debt in connection with future acquisitions. As of June 30, 2020, the EPRA NRV of our real estate portfolio amounted to €4,318 million and the LTV-Ratio was 53.5%. As of the same date, the pro _forma net LTV ratio (i.e. the ratio of net debt to value of real estate assets as adjusted for certain divestments)_ of Consus Real Estate was 83.0%. Any additional debt incurred in connection with future acquisitions could have a significant negative impact on our performance indicators EPRA NRV and LTV-Ratio and could result in higher interest expenses for us. If we are no longer able to obtain the debt or equity financing required to acquire additional property portfolios, or if we are able to do so only on onerous terms, our further business development and competitiveness could be severely constrained.

    Title: When we attempt to mitigate interest rate risk by entering into hedging agreements, we also become exposed to the risks associated with the valuation of hedging instruments and hedge counterparties and the hedging agreements may not be effective.
    Text: We have entered, and in the future may enter, into financing agreements with variable interest rates. Although we typically hedge our variable interest rate financing agreements using customary market hedging instruments, the hedging instruments that we use may not completely counterbalance a potential change in interest rates or may not match the loan maturity. As of June 30, 2020, a part of our loans that carried a variable interest rate, totaling a book value of €123 million, was hedged. The valuation of hedging instruments itself depends on the level of interest rates, impacting our equity and, to a lesser extent, our results of operations. A similar decrease in the interest rate would have resulted in the opposite, but even more pronounced, effect, meaning it would have had a negative impact on our equity and a positive effect on our results of operations and our net assets. Further, we may be unable to enter into, or only at significantly higher costs, extensions or renegotiations of hedging instruments that may become necessary given the interest rate terms at the relevant time. We are exposed to the risk that our hedging counterparties will not perform their obligations as established by the hedging agreements into which we have entered. Hedging counterparties may default on their obligations to us due to lack of liquidity, operational failure, bankruptcy or for other reasons. Following the recent financial crises, the risk of counterparty default has become increasingly relevant. Market conditions have led to the failure or merger of a number of prominent businesses and financial institutions under distressed conditions in recent years. Further, in case of negative floating interest rates we are obliged under hedging agreements in form of swaps to pay an additional amount to the respective hedge counterparty. Such amount is in addition to our obligation to pay the fixed amount and calculated based on the negative floating interest rates and the relevant nominal amount for the period. Accordingly, in case of material negative floating interest rates these payment obligations will be material as well.

    Title: nan
    Text: valuations as of June 30, 2020, undertaken by NAI Apollo. According thereto, as of June 30, 2020, the fair value of the development properties owned by the Consus Group was €3.0 billion. Valuations are based on assumptions that could subsequently turn out to be incorrect. The recording of investment properties at the cost of acquisition or production occurs only at the time the property is received. On the balance sheet dates subsequent to the accession of the property, the fair value of the property is used. The equity attributable to shareholders calculated on the basis of the best practice recommendations of the European Public Real Estate Association (“EPRA”) (amended for the value from the revaluation of trading properties and adjusted for deferred taxes, the fair value of derivative financial instruments) (“EPRA NAV”) reflects the fair value of net assets on an ongoing and long-term basis. As of June 30, 2020, the EPRA NAV of our real estate properties amounted to €3,755 million. With effect as from January 1, 2020, EPRA developed new ratios to reflect changes in the regulatory framework in Europe. As a result of these changes, EPRA NAV will be replaced by, among others, a ratio that highlights the value of net assets on a long-term basis, where assets and liabilities that are not expected to crystallize in normal circumstances, such as the fair value of financial derivatives and deferred taxes on property valuation surpluses are excluded and where, in an effort to reflect the value required to rebuild the company, related costs, including real estate transfer taxes, are included (“EPRA NRV”). We believe that a significant difference between EPRA NAV and EPRA NRV involves the real estate transfer tax of the properties held. While real estate transfer tax was deducted for property valuation purposes under EPRA NAV, real estate transfer tax is included for property valuation purposes under EPRA NRV in an effort to reflect the low likeliness of property sales in the current market environment. For purposes of comparability, the ADLER Group intends to continue to report EPRA NAV for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2020. As of June 30, 2020, the EPRA NRV of our real estate properties amounted to €4,318 million. The best evidence of fair value is supplied by, for example, the general market environment, interest rate levels, the creditworthiness of the tenants, conditions in the rental market and the quality and potential development of the locations. The valuation of real estate is therefore subject to numerous uncertainties. The past or future assumptions underlying the property valuations may later be determined to be erroneous. In particular, there can be no certainty regarding the potential economic effects and outcomes of the Berlin rent freeze (Mietendeckel) (or any future legislative decisions to restrict or limit rents chargeable for residential units) on the valuations or any potential future revision thereof. Accordingly, there is a risk that if a downturn occurs in the real estate market or the general economic situation, we may need to revise downward the values of our total portfolio on the consolidated statement of financial position. Any change in fair value must be recognized as a profit or loss under the fair value adjustment. In the six-month period ended June 30, 2020, we recognized a profit due to a change in fair value of € 141 million, while profit recognized due to a change in fair value amounted to €462 million in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019. The valuation of real estate is based on multiple factors that also include the appraiser’s subjective judgment. In valuing properties, the appraisers are required to make certain key assumptions in respect of matters including, but not limited to, the existence of willing buyers, title to the property, condition of structure and services, deleterious materials, environmental matters, legal matters, statutory and regulatory requirements and ----- planning, transaction pricing, estimated market rental values, market yields, expected future rental revenues from the property and other factors. The adoption of different assumptions would be likely to produce different valuation results and assumptions may prove to be inaccurate and could negatively affect the valuation of our properties. Property valuations are complex, involve the use of data which is not publicly available and involve a degree of subjective professional judgment by the appraiser. As a result, any valuation presents the external appraiser’s best estimate of the value of our properties or acquisition targets. However, there can be no assurance that the valuations accurately reflect the actual sale proceeds that will be achieved upon a sale (or purchase) of the properties valued, even where any such transaction occurs shortly after the relevant valuation date, and particularly if, due to unforeseen circumstances, we would be forced to sell (or purchase) properties under unfavorable conditions. Likewise, there can be no assurance that the estimated yields and estimated rental values will prove to be achievable. Any deviation between the valuations of our properties or acquisition targets to the reflected value of the underlying properties may require us to make significant fair value adjustments in the future.

    Title: German laws protecting residential tenants and existing restrictions on the rate of rental increases could make it more difficult to increase the rents of residential units we own.
    Text: In Germany, the landlord-tenant relationship is subject to a significant level of statutory regulation which, for the most part, provides far-reaching social protection for tenants under residential leases. According to German law, for example, a landlord may not increase residential rents by more than an aggregate of 20% over a threeyear period in general and by no more than an aggregate of 15% in Berlin. If the parties to a tenancy agreement have not agreed on a gradual rent (Staffelmiete) or an index-linked rent (Indexmiete), which is only permissible within certain limits and unusual in residential leases, and the tenant refuses to amend the tenancy agreement, a rent increase may be effected unilaterally within the statutory and contractual limits set forth in the respective rent index (Mietspiegel), or for those units that were modernized or to compensate for certain necessary construction measures. Following a rent increase, the tenants may have a special termination right. The Berlin municipality publishes a new qualified rent index every two years. The latest update of the rent index for Berlin has been published on May 13, 2019. The average residential rents in Berlin increased in the time period 2017 – 2019 by 2.5% per year whereas in the time period from 2015 – 2017 the increase was at a level of 4.6 % per year. In addition to the generally applicable rent increase restrictions as mentioned above, we are subject to additional restraints on rent increases arising from the acquisition agreements through which the respective real estate portfolio or property for privatization was purchased. Such restrictions limit our ability to impose rent increases as the increase may not exceed the average cost of living index for a defined amount. Further mandatory legal provisions impose occupancy restrictions on landlords who have received public subsidies with regard to residential units. As of June 30, 2020, 4.2% (by sqm) of our residential units were subject to rent restrictions that stem from public subsidies, accounting for 3.6% of our total rental income. The assumptions in our business plan with respect to the effect of occupancy rights and restrictions on rent increases may prove to be inaccurate. To the extent that the assumptions made are inaccurate, our rental income and operating profit may not grow over time or not as quickly as we have assumed or may remain static. Affordable housing has been and continues to be a political topic of controversial discussion in Berlin and throughout Germany. During the last couple of years, legislative developments have adversely affected our business. For example, in 2011 the parliament of the State of Berlin passed a law on social housing ----- (Wohnraumgesetz Berlin) that provides for, inter alia, stricter rules on rent restrictions for recipients of certain public housing subsidies. Furthermore, this legislation allows tenants of state-subsidized housing to terminate the existing letting contract in certain cases of rent increases, within a period of three months. Moreover, changes to the legal framework may further negatively impact our ability to increase rents. Affordable housing continues to be a political topic that attracts a high level of attention. German residential landlord tenant law (Wohnraummietrecht) is considered to be tenant friendly in many respects, including limits on the amount of rent chargeable. Restrictions and ceilings for existing and new leases, such as the rent cap (Mietpreisbremse) and the rent freeze (Mietendeckel), as well as restrictions on rent increases following modernization of the properties in accordance with the German Tenancy Adjustment Act (Mietrechtsanpassungsgesetz), which came into force in January 2019, are further examples for restrictions on rent increases. The German Act on Curbing Rent Increases in Tight Housing Markets and the Strengthening of the Orderer Principle with respect to the Business of Rental Agents—Tenancy Law Amendment Act (Gesetz zur Dämpfung _des Mietanstiegs auf angespannten Wohnungsmärkten und zur Stärkung des Bestellerprinzips bei der Wohnungsvermittlung—Mietrechtsnovellierungsgesetz) (“MietNovG”) entered into force on June 1, 2015. A_ provision of MietNovG that authorizes the German federal state governments to determine areas with a tight housing market already entered into force on April 27, 2015. A decree declaring Berlin as an area with a tight housing market was issued by the Berlin government on April 28, 2015. One of the main topics of MietNovG is a cap on rents for new leases (Mietpreisbremse). This rent cap provides that, subject to certain exceptions such as the first-time lease of newly build apartments, no rent may exceed the local comparative rent by a maximum of 10% in case of new lettings of residential units in areas designated as a tight residential rental market. However, the rent cap only applies if the federal states have implemented ordinances designating areas as tight residential rental market. In addition, the German Tenancy Adjustment Act tightens the provisions for implementing the rent cap at the expense of landlords. According to the new provisions, landlords are obliged in certain cases to provide a tenant with unsolicited information on the rent achieved for the apartment prior to the conclusion of the rental agreement. In addition, it has been made easier for tenants to make a complaint based on the rent cap. Whereas tenants previously had to submit a qualified complaint, which had to contain the facts on which the complaint was based, a simple complaint is sufficient under the new law. On June 18, 2019, Berlin’s municipal government (Berliner Senat) announced its intention to freeze rents in Berlin for the next five years. The so-called “Mietendeckel” was passed on January 30, 2020 by Berlin’s parliament (Berliner Abgeordnetenhaus) and entered into force on February 23, 2020. On the basis of the Law on Rent Limitation in Housing in Berlin (Gesetz zur Mietenbegrenzung im Wohnungswesen in Berlin – _MietenWoG Bln) (the “Berlin Rent Limitation Law”), the rents for living space in Berlin (except for subsidized_ and newly built living space) shall be capped retrospectively as of June 18, 2019. Among other things, the passed law provides that the administration can take action ex officio against landlords in the event of violations of the permitted rent amount. An application by the tenant to lower the rent to the permissible level, as was provided for by the draft law of the Berlin municipal government (Berliner Senat), is not necessary. Furthermore, violations of the rent freeze in connection with existing rents and future rent increases, insofar as these exceed the limits intended by the rent freeze constitute administrative offenses. These administrative offenses may be punished with fines of up to €500,000 per individual case. In case we have agreed on provisions in individual or a multitude of cases in connection with our approximately 17,710 existing leases as of June 30, 2020 or with new leases, by which we would violate the provisions of the Berlin Rent Limitation Law or comparable laws that restrict or lower the current rent level, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, net assets, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. The ADLER Group and the ADLER Real Estate Group combined generated approximately €147.0 million rental income in the six-month period June 30, 2020, or 28.6% of its total net rental income in the six-month period ended June 30, 2020, exposed to the “Mietendeckel” regulation. We expect the combined impact of such regulation to result in a decrease of rental income in the amount of approximately €1 million for 2020 and €9 million for 2021, mostly due to the reversion of rents to the maximum levels as of November 2020. On May 6, 2020, certain members of the German Federal Parliament (Bundestag) filed an application for judicial review (Normenkontrollantrag) with the German Federal Constitutional Court ----- (Bundesverfassungsgericht) to ascertain the compliance of the Berlin Rent Limitation Law with German federal constitutional law. Any further tightening of existing or the introduction of additional rent restrictions could limit our ability to implement an increase in rental costs across any part of or all of our portfolio and, ultimately, negatively affect our strategy. Any failure to comply with or violation of legislation regarding rent restrictions could result in our obligation to repay any surplus rents charged and, additionally, to pay substantial fines. Furthermore, any other cap, tenant-friendly regulation or regulation serving the protection of tenants may considerably impair our ability to raise rents. Further, German law and German courts provide tenants with protection against tenant evictions. Delayed evictions resulting from these protections can lead to substantial losses until the property is actually vacated.

    Title: Our business is subject to the general legal environment in Germany. Any disadvantageous changes in the legal environment, such as mandatory environmental modernization provisions, restrictions regarding modernization measures or provisions (including taxes) that result in the incurrence of costs in the event of a property sale, or disadvantageous changes to the Berlin Mietspiegel regulation, may be detrimental to us.
    Text: Our business is subject to the general legal framework that applies to housing, including German tenancy law, as well as special provisions in other laws and regulations, such as social legislation, building and construction laws, monument protection laws and federal or state laws and regulations. Any changes to German or European laws, which could include changes that have retroactive effect, or changes in the interpretation or application of existing laws could, therefore, have a negative effect on our business. Changes to tenant protection laws could make it more difficult to evict tenants, increase rents or pass on ancillary costs or modernization investment costs to the tenants. This could have a material adverse effect on the profitability of our investments, results of operations and prospects. More restrictive environmental laws could also result in additional expenses. For example, since 2011, owners of specified centralized heated water supply facilities for use in multi-family residential units are obliged to test the level of potential legionella contamination at least every three years, thereby incurring additional costs for the testing as well as for remediation measures, if contamination is detected. Additional costs would also be incurred if the legal requirements relating to the construction and use of existing properties were to become more onerous. Construction and environmental requirements are of particular significance in this context. For example, the currently applicable version of the German Energy Savings Regulation (Energieeinsparverordnung) prescribes specified investments into renovation aimed at reducing energy consumption (for instance, with respect to thermal insulation) and requires a landlord to present an energy certificate that discloses the property’s energy efficiency to a potential tenant prior to entering into a new lease agreement. The same applies with respect to the sale of properties. Additionally, requirements may be imposed in order to increase the availability of disabled-accessible and adapted housing. Furthermore, the German Federal Parliament (Bundestag) is currently in the process of implementing the German Building Electromobility Infrastructure Act (Gebäude-Elektromobilitätsinfrastruktur-Gesetz) (the “GEIG”) to implement the EU Building Directive 2018/844 into national law. According to the GEIG, new residential buildings or existing residential buildings that undergo a significant renovation (i.e., a renovation that affects over 25% of the surface of the building shell) and that have more than ten parking spaces, must ensure that such parking spaces are equipped with electric charging capabilities. In addition, we could be adversely affected by changes to public building law which could restrict our ability to manage our properties in the way we had previously expected. On March 3, 2015, the Berlin government passed a regulation (Umwandlungsverordnung) according to which a conversion of a building into condominiums is prohibited in milieu protection areas (Milieuschutzgebiete) of the city unless the relevant district has granted permission by means of an exception to this regulation. This regulation expired on March 13, 2020, but was renewed on the same date. The landlords of rented apartments require an exception permission (Ausnahmebewilligung) by the relevant district to sell the apartment. Such exception permissions may be granted, for example, in case that the apartment shall be sold to the current tenant within seven years following the conversion. Although this does not affect the sale of an entire property, regulation may hinder the conversion and sale of single apartments. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, 63 areas of Berlin are defined as milieu protection areas (Milieuschutzgebiete), within which 6,239 units of our real estate portfolios are located. The Berlin government may, on an ongoing basis, decide to extend milieu protection (Milieuschutz). ----- If, in the course of a refurbishment or modernization, it should be discovered that a building undergoing said processes is subject to monument protection laws, the need to comply with monument protection requirements could lead to significant delays in the refurbishment or modernization process, in the inability to carry out particular refurbishment or modernization measures, and also in significantly higher costs for the particular project. These factors could render us incapable of performing our contractual obligations vis-à-vis a buyer, with the consequence that the buyer’s obligation to pay the purchase price would be excused or deferred.

    Title: We may fail to comply with applicable or future laws and regulations in relation to privacy and data protection or such laws and regulations may change in a manner that is unfavorable to our business.
    Text: Before entering into a lease agreement, a potential tenant provides us with certain personal data on which basis we determine whether to enter into a lease agreement with such tenant. Furthermore, such personal data is stored by us. As of June 30, 2020, we have cumulatively entered into approximately 166,000 lease agreements with more than 170,000 parties (excluding the units sold under the Gewobag Sale) and, as a result thereof, stored a significant amount of personal data. The collection, use and storing of data is subject to regulation under German data protection law. In addition, the EU recently enacted Regulation 2016/679/EU of April 27, 2016 (General Data Protection Regulation) (the “GDPR”). The GDPR automatically came into effect in all EU member states as of May 25, 2018, and imposed stricter conditions and limitations in relation to the processing, use and transmission of personal data. The GDPR introduced extensive documentation obligations and considerably higher transparency requirements, which affect not only initial data collection but also the monitoring and investigation once personal data has been collected. We may not have prepared for these changes to the extent necessary and our preparations may not yield the expected results. Additionally, although we strive to comply with all applicable laws, regulations and legal obligations relating to data usage and data protection, it is possible that these laws, regulations and other obligations may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our practices. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that our practices have complied, comply or will comply fully with all such laws, regulations and other legal obligations. Our process of developing and advancing our data protection standards and procedures may take longer and require more resources than originally planned. Any non-compliance by us with the applicable regulations could lead to fines and other sanctions. For example, the GDPR provides that violations can be fined, depending on the circumstances, by up to the higher of €20 million and 4% of the annual global turnover of the non-compliant company.

    Title: Administrative decisions could affect our ability to conduct our business at our discretion.
    Text: We could be adversely affected by decisions from public authorities on a municipal level. For instance, as of June 30, 2020, 1,244 units of our real estate portfolio, accounting for 7.6% of our rental income as of the same date, are situated in preservation areas (Erhaltungsgebiete) within Berlin, which imposes certain restrictions on the use and refurbishment of property. Such restrictions require, for example, obtaining the public authority’s permission prior to entering into a lease agreement with a term longer than one year or selling the property. In addition, once the redevelopment has been completed, the municipality levies a compensation charge to reflect the increased value of the land due to the redevelopment. Any administrative decision that would affect our ability to conduct our business at our discretion could have a material adverse effect on our business, net assets, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.

    Title: The use of standardized contracts could result in claims for damages against us under a number of contracts, or in the loss of certain rights and privileges or of the respective rights to claim damages, if errors or problems arise in connection with the enforcement of such contracts.
    Text: As of June 30, 2020, we are the lessor under approximately 84,300 lease agreements with our tenants. As our business involves a large number of individual units and tenants, each with a relatively small individual value, we maintain numerous legal relationships, in particular with tenants, contractors and service providers, any one of which is not financially material to us. As a means of efficiently managing these legal relationships, we often make use of standardized documents and form contracts. In addition, we have adopted long-term standardized lease agreements through our various acquisitions. These documents and contracts often contain ambiguities or errors, and the fact that any given document or contract is standardized may cause a significant number of contractual terms or even the validity of a large number of contracts to be affected. Due to frequent changes in the law, particularly in case law regarding general terms and conditions (Allgemeine Geschäftsbedingungen), the use of such standardized contractual terms is not without risk. For example, it is possible that, as a result of ----- changes to statutes or case law, ambiguities or errors in standard contract terms may give rise to claims or cause such subsidiaries to lose certain rights and privileges, or to lose their right to claim damages which could, in turn, adversely affect our rental income and operating profit. Even in the case of contracts being prepared with legal advice, it is impossible for us to avoid problems of this nature in advance or in the future, because changes could occur in the legal framework, particularly via case law, making it impossible for us to avoid the ensuing legal disadvantages.

    Title: We may incur environmental liabilities, for example, from residual pollution including wartime ordinance, soil conditions, asbestos and contaminants in building materials, as well as from possible building code violations.
    Text: Properties we own or acquire may contain soil or groundwater contamination, hazardous substances, wartime ordnance (including potentially unexploded ordnance) and/or other residual pollution and environmental risks. A certain number of our assets are listed in the register of contaminated sites. Buildings and their fixtures might also contain asbestos, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane, polychlorinated biphenyl, pentachlorophenol and lindane above the allowable or recommended thresholds, or the buildings could bear other environmental risks, e.g. flooring material containing asbestos (i.e. “Floorflex” flooring). In total, as of June 30, 2020, 5.7% of our residential real estate units (by sqm) and 6.8% of our commercial real estate units (by sqm) were identified as containing this flooring material. For example, certain of our properties contain asbestos contamination which, from time to time, requires us to do refurbishments. In particular, we have received notice that one of our buildings contains substantial asbestos contamination for which we expect significant refurbishment expenses. Refurbishment and removal of this material takes place regularly as part of our maintenance and repair efforts and the costs for these regular removals are reflected in our budgeting. Moreover, we own or may acquire properties that may contain undetected hazardous substances, such as lead from pipes in buildings built around the turn of the nineteenth century and legionella (see “Our business is subject to the general legal environment _in Germany. Any disadvantageous changes in the legal environment, such as mandatory environmental modernization provisions, restrictions regarding modernization measures or provisions (including taxes) that result in the incurrence of costs in the event of a property sale, or disadvantageous changes to the Berlin Mietspiegel or other regulation, may be detrimental to us.”), which are harmful to the health of the residents or_ contain such other environmental risks or contain substances which are not yet viewed as being harmful to the health of the residents, and are therefore not being categorized as hazardous. These materials may be detected or categorized as hazardous, and we may be obliged to remove and dispose of such materials. We bear the risk of cost-intensive assessment, remediation or removal of such ground, soil or water contamination, hazardous substances, wartime ordnance or other residual pollution. The discovery of any such residual pollution on the sites and/or in the buildings, particularly in connection with the letting or sale of properties or borrowing using the real estate as security, could trigger claims for rent reductions, the termination of letting contracts for cause or for damages and other breach of warranty claims against us. The remediation of any pollution and the related additional measures we would have to undertake could negatively affect us and could involve considerable additional costs that we may have to bear. We are also exposed to the risk that recourse against the polluter or the previous owners of the properties might not be possible, for example, because they cannot be identified, no longer exist or have become insolvent. Moreover, the existence or even the mere suspicion of the existence of ground contamination, hazardous materials, wartime ordnance or other residual pollution can negatively affect the value of a property and our ability to let or sell such a property. Moreover, environmental laws impose actual and contingent obligations on us to undertake remedial action on contaminated sites and in contaminated buildings. These obligations may relate to properties we currently own or operate, properties we have formerly owned or operated or properties where waste has been deposited. Furthermore, actions for damages or remediation measures may be brought against us, namely under the German Federal Soil Protection Act (Bundesbodenschutzgesetz). According to this Act, not only the polluter but also its legal successor, the owner of the contaminated site and certain previous owners may be held liable for soil and pond water contamination. The costs of any removal, investigation or remediation of any residual pollution on such sites or in such buildings as well as costs related to legal proceedings, including potential damages, regarding such matters may be substantial, and it may be impossible, for a number of reasons, for us to have recourse against a former seller of a contaminated site or building or the party that may otherwise be responsible for the contamination. Laws and regulations, as may be amended over time, may also impose liability for the ----- release of certain materials into the air or water from a property, including chrysotile containing materials (CCM), and such release could form the basis for liability to third parties for personal injury or other damages. In addition, if our employees infringe or have infringed environmental protection laws, we could be exposed to civil or criminal damages. We may be required to provide for additional reserves to sufficiently allocate toward our potential obligations to remove and dispose of any hazardous and toxic substances. Our business is also exposed to the risk of non-compliance with building codes or environmental regulations, including those applicable in Berlin. Even though we usually conduct inspections during the acquisition of individual properties, there is a risk that building codes or environmental regulations have not been complied with. It is also possible that landlord responsibilities could be further expanded with respect to fire protection and environmental protection, which could require additional refurbishment, maintenance and modernization requirements. Furthermore, the projected cost of such measures is based on the assumption that the required permits are issued promptly and that they are consistent with our plans. It is possible, however, that the required building permits will not always be issued in due course. If such permits are not issued promptly, or are issued only subject to conditions, this can lead to substantial delays in correcting the problems and result in higher than projected costs and lower rental income for the relevant properties.

    Title: We may not be granted building and other permits, or may be granted them only subject to onerous conditions, or additional requirements may be imposed on existing building and other permits.
    Text: The construction, alteration and refurbishment or a change of use of buildings will not be possible until a building permit is granted, it may be uncertain whether the relevant authorities will approve a respective construction project and what additional requirements may be imposed in connection with the building permit. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, we have two pending requests for the issuance of building permits, comprising a total of 1,382 sqm. In addition, special permissions could be required and must be obtained, particularly for measures taking place in urban redevelopment areas (Sanierungsgebiete) or preservation areas (Erhaltungsgebiete) and for real estates and buildings which are protected historic monuments. If we are not granted a building permit or another required permit, or a building permit or another required permit is granted only subject to onerous conditions, the rental income that we expect to generate from the relevant real estate could be considerably less than originally calculated. If a renovation project becomes financially unfeasible because a building permit or another required permit is not granted or is granted only subject to onerous conditions, we may not be able to or decide to not carry out the project and any expenditure already incurred may be lost. Moreover, changes in the requirements for construction or modernization of existing real estate could result in unforeseen additional costs. Any increase in operating costs resulting from the above-described events would adversely affect our operating profit. In addition, our remaining project development activities may be substantially impaired if the granting of a building permit is substantially delayed, made subject to additional administrative building constraints (baurechtliche Auflagen) or declined altogether.

Does the text mention that the company is exposed to risks associated with cyclical products?

    Title: We could be subject to liability claims for several years after selling properties.
    Text: In connection with the sale of properties (privatization), we make representations, warranties and negative declarations of knowledge to the purchasers with respect to certain characteristics of the relevant properties. The resulting obligations usually continue to exist after the sale, for a period of several years. In the six-month period ended June 30, 2020 and the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, we have sold 13 and 62 residential units of our units held for privatization, respectively. In particular, we could be subject to claims for damages from purchasers, who could assert that we failed to meet our obligations, or that the representations we made to them were untrue. We could be required to make payments to the purchasers following legal disputes or litigation. If we do not have cash available to conduct such litigation or make such payments, we may be required to borrow funds, or, if we are unable to borrow funds to make such payments, we may be forced to sell investments to obtain such funds, which would in turn cause reduced levels of rental income and operating profit. If we provide warranties to third parties in connection with maintenance and modernization measures and claims are asserted against us because of defects, it is not always certain that we will have recourse against the companies that performed the work. As a seller of properties, we are also liable to tenants for any breach of tenancy agreements by the buyer under certain circumstances, even where we no longer have any control over the property. Moreover, we continue to be exposed to liability for breach of contract even if the buyer resells the property and the subsequent buyer breaches any tenancy agreement. If, however, we notify the tenant of the change in ownership and the tenant fails to avail itself of the opportunity to terminate the tenancy at the earliest permitted termination date, we are, ----- in general, released from liability. As a rule, when selling properties, we inform all tenants in writing of the change in landlord either alone or together with the acquirer. Such release from liability does not apply to security deposits _(Mietbürgschaften) provided by the tenants. If the tenant is unable to receive its security deposit from the buyer of the property, the liability to repay such security deposit remains with the seller. In connection with any of the aforementioned or similar risks, we may be facing legal or settlement costs, including the costs of defending lawsuits, whether justified or not, as well as potential damages associated with liability for properties that we have sold. This could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.

    Title: Our risk management and compliance systems as well as our accounting practices may prove to be partially or completely insufficient or fail, and unknown, unrecognized, underestimated or unexpected risks may materialize, any of which could lead to government investigations and significant reputation, financial or other consequences. We may fail to adequately account for potential liabilities or risk exposures.
    Text: There is no guarantee that our risk management or compliance systems are sufficient to manage the risks we face. We may be faced with risks that were previously unknown, unrecognized, underestimated or unconsidered, and our risk management or compliance systems may function incorrectly or fail. Inappropriate risk management or compliance measures may cause irregularities leading to, among other things, cash losses or delays in completion of development projects, or to official investigations or third-party claims against us, which in turn could have significant financial, reputational and other consequences. Moreover, there can be no assurance that our application of accounting policies is in accordance with principles set by various standard-setting and supervisory authorities as well as national laws. The _Commission de _Surveillance du Secteur Financier (the “CSSF”) is currently conducting a focused examination on the_ application of IFRS 15 in accordance with the priorities of its 2020 enforcement campaign. In connection with the campaign, we have received an information request from the CSSF in relation to our financial information and the application of IFRS 15 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019. The CSSF may impose administrative sanctions if it concludes that our application of IFRS 15 is in violation of Luxembourg laws. We book provisions for potential liabilities such as tax liabilities, litigation exposure and bad debt. These provisions are based on management’s assumptions, estimates and judgements, and there is no guarantee that the provisions we have taken will adequately account for our actual liabilities. Failure to take adequate provisions against potential liabilities could have significant financial consequences for us.

    Title: The structure of the Company is mainly influenced by the general tax environment in Luxembourg, Germany and further countries of the European Union (Netherlands, Denmark, Malta and Ireland) and changes in the tax environment may increase our tax burden.
    Text: In addition to the Company, which is established in Luxembourg, we consist of more than 100 companies. These companies have registered offices in Germany, Luxembourg and further countries of the European Union (Netherlands, Denmark, Malta and Ireland). Our companies are subject to the tax laws of their jurisdictions of registration and the jurisdictions where they conduct business. The cross-border participation of the Company in its subsidiaries provides for various tax aspects, including cross-border taxation issues governed by directives of the European Union and/or double-tax treaties between Luxembourg and the jurisdictions of the subsidiaries. It cannot be excluded that tax authorities in the countries in which we are active may not share the view of our tax assessment, which could lead to additional tax burdens for us in any of these countries. For example, in the course of our business, we have entered into several cross-border financing transactions and any change or different treatment in the tax treatment in this context may have adverse tax effects. The same applies to the non-deductibility or requalification of intragroup loans and financings with third parties, intragroup payments for services, the different interpretation of the tax residency of a subsidiary, the assumption of a permanent establishment, the non-recognition of the VAT group with regard to the group companies or the non-granting of the so-called further reduction for the German real estate companies. Also, the tax laws in any of these jurisdictions or double-tax treaties between these countries could change in the future, even with retroactive effect, which could cause additional tax burdens for us. Moreover, some of our group companies have significant tax loss carry forwards (“Tax Losses”) in an amount above €1 million. The aggregate amount of the companies’ Tax Losses as of December 31, 2017 was ----- €135.3 million for corporate income tax (“CIT”) purposes and €69.5 million for trade tax (“TT”) purposes. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, the aggregate amount of Tax Losses for 193 group companies for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 was €145.6 million for CIT purposes and €110.7 million for TT purposes. Final data regarding Tax Losses following the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 are not yet available and could turn out to be significant. Some of these Tax Losses may have been or may be forfeited in whole or in part in the past or future, as a result of past restructurings, the initial public offering in July 2015 or future changes of the shareholders. In particular, any past or future corporate reorganization within the Group or relating to the Company’s shareholding structure may result in the partial or complete forfeiture of the Tax Losses (to the extent the Tax Losses are not covered by taxable hidden reserves in our assets). With regard to the migration of the Company from Cyprus to Luxembourg, we have received a binding ruling that no German Real Estate Transfer Tax (“RETT”) (Grunderwerbsteuer) has been triggered but did not apply for a ruling regarding impact on the Tax Losses. The tax burden in past or future periods would increase if profits could not be set of against Tax Losses.

    Title: We are subject to the tax environment in Luxembourg, Germany and further countries of the European Union (Netherlands, Denmark, Malta and Ireland) and Israel. Our tax burden may increase as a consequence of current or future tax assessments, tax audits or court proceedings based on changes in tax laws or changes in the application or interpretation thereof.
    Text: We are subject to the tax environment in Luxembourg, Germany and further countries of the European Union (Netherlands, Denmark, Malta and Ireland) and Israel. Our tax burden primarily depends on various aspects of tax laws, as well as their application and interpretation. Amendments to tax laws may have a retroactive effect, and the application or interpretation of tax laws by tax authorities or courts may change. Furthermore, court decisions are occasionally limited to their specific facts by tax authorities. Any of these developments may increase or alter our tax burden. A number of factors may also impact our tax situation. For example, due to the Coronavirus, the managing directors of ADO Group Ltd. are currently residing in Germany and cannot travel to Israel. Therefore, all management decisions are taken in Germany and not Israel and the Israeli tax authority may come to the conclusion that this continued situation may trigger an Israeli exit-tax. Furthermore, we are required to file tax declarations in Luxembourg, Germany and further countries of the European Union as well as Israel, from time to time, and any tax assessments that deviate from our tax declarations may increase or alter our tax obligations. Our individual entities are regularly subject to tax audits by the competent tax authorities which may result in increases in our tax obligations or penalties and fines. We may also be subject to administrative or judicial proceedings with respect to its tax declarations, and may incur substantial time and effort in addressing and resolving tax issues. In addition, changes in tax legislation, administrative practice or case law, which are possible at any time and may occur on short notice, could have adverse tax consequences for us. The applicable tax rates, for example with respect to property tax, property transfer tax or capital gains tax, may also change rapidly and with short notice. Changes in RETT may also negatively affect the value of our portfolio. Additionally, changes could be made to the ability to depreciate owned real estate. Additionally, divergent statutory interpretations by the tax authorities or the courts are possible.

Does the text mention that the company is exposed to risks associated with cyclical products?

    Title: We are exposed to real estate transfer taxes (RETT).
    Text: Increases in the applicable RETT rates for the properties in our portfolio could negatively impact the portfolio by, among other things, reducing the value of and the proceeds from a sale of the affected properties or by reducing purchase demand for the affected properties or by reducing the valuation of the affected properties in the portfolio. We currently hold real estate in Germany and shares in companies which own real estate in Germany. In Germany, the transfer of real estate or of a 95% or greater interest in a company that owns real estate triggers a potential liability for RETT. It cannot be excluded that RETT will be triggered post-Completion, upon an acquisition of additional shares in ADLER Real Estate after the Completion or the reorganization of the ADLER Group. Because of the complexity of the RETT laws in Germany, we may from time to time seek to acquire properties with less than a 95% stake in the ownership company. This may result in an increased complexity of the transaction and stronger minority rights of the associate parties. As a consequence, transaction costs and future ----- administrative expenses for the newly acquired property would generally rise, too. Recently proposed changes to German RETT laws aim to tighten the statutory RETT framework with regard to share deals. Accordingly, share deals that do not trigger any RETT may no longer be possible in the future or such acquisitions might be more difficult. In broad terms these proposals are to (i) extend the stricter partnership RETT rules to incorporated companies; (ii) reduce the economic ownership threshold upon which RETT is triggered from 95% of the shares or interest in a property company, as it is currently, to 90%; and (iii) extend the 5 year cooling period to 10 years. As a result, RETT will be payable unless the seller retains over 10% of the shares or interest in a property company for at least 10 years. While the draft bill originally stipulated that the respective legislative changes shall come into force in January 2020, it was announced at the end of 2019 by the political parties currently forming the German government that the intended changes to RETT will not come into force as of January 1, 2020 as originally planned. It is currently unclear if and to which extent such changes will enter into force at a later stage potentially with retroactive effect. Any increase in applicable RETT rates for the properties in our portfolio could have a material adverse effect on our business, net assets, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.

    Title: The integration of the ADLER Real Estate Group into the ADLER Group could potentially not be consummated as intended and could result in expenses not anticipated at all or not adequately accounted for and the Company could potentially be legally bound to consummate the integration regardless of a materially adverse change of its economic rationale.
    Text: Following the Completion, the ADLER Real Estate Group is being integrated into the ADLER Group (the “Integration”). We expect the Integration to be a multi-year process that requires significant human and financial resources. The successful integration of the existing workforces, IT systems, corporate cultures and corporate structures and the introduction of joint processes are essential to the success of the Integration. The Integration will be time-consuming and costly and could negatively affect our business operations and/or those of the ADLER Real Estate Group. We and the ADLER Real Estate Group could be confronted with a variety of difficulties during the process of the Integration, including, among others: - The administration of a significantly larger group, including the size of the portfolio and number of assets; - The combinations and standardizations of the business activities, including the services offered to tenants and customers and the coordination of the business activities; - The coordination of the corporate and administrative structures and the harmonization of insurance coverage; - Unexpected problems relating to the coordination of the accounting-, IT-, communications and administrative systems and other systems; - Problems to adequately cope with potential differences in the corporate cultures and leadership philosophies; - The implementation of uniform standards, control mechanisms, procedures and guidelines; - Legal disputes related to the Integration, including legal disputes with shareholders; - The diversion of the attention of the management from other areas of the business activities; - Maintaining existing agreements and business relationships with tenants, customers, service providers and financing banks and delays related to the entering into of new contracts with future tenants, customers, service providers and financing banks; - Unforeseen and unexpected obligations in relation to the Integration and the business of the ADLER Real Estate Group; - The inability to enter into a domination agreement (Beherrschungsvertrag) with ADLER Real Estate in order to give us effective control over its management; and ----- - The identification and elimination of obsolete business activities and assets, including those that fall short of expectations. Any inability of the ADLER Group to efficiently and effectively carry out the Integration could lead to a reduction or failure or delay in the realization of the anticipated advantages and cost savings envisaged in connection with the Integration could negatively affect the ADLER Group. The Integration could result in additional or unforeseen costs and the anticipated advantages of the Integration could potentially not be realized in full or not at all. To the extent actual growth and costs savings are realized, these could fall short of anticipations and their achievement could require more time than currently anticipated by the Company. Any inability of the Company to adequately address and manage the challenges of the Integration could result in a decrease of the anticipated benefits of the Integration or in the premature termination of the Integration.

These are all risks associated with the integration of the ADLER Real Estate Group into the ADLER Group."}

Does the text mention that the company is exposed to risks associated with cyclical products?

    Title: The synergies expected as a result of the Integration could potentially not be fully realized or not realized at all or eroded by expenses not anticipated.
    Text: The Company believes that the Integration could entail various effects from synergies and economies of scale. In particular, it is anticipated that these effects will be realized by the continuous advancement of complementing services and offerings, a combined management organization, combined back-office functions, optimized local managements and a focus to achieve synergies with regards to the overhead costs of the ADLER Group. In addition to operational synergies, the Company expects certain financing synergies in relation to ADLER Real Estate’s current indebtedness. In addition, synergies and economies of scale could also be realized by implementing certain corporate measures and intra-group transactions, including a debt-to-equity swap at the level of ADLER Real Estate Group as announced on October 2, 2020. However, such measures and transactions could be challenged by the Company’s shareholders or third parties. As a result, there is no assurance that the Company will be able to implement such corporate measures and transactions as originally planned or at all. For example, on October 15, 2020, the Company received a copy of a letter by a certain minority shareholder of ADLER Real Estate to the local court (Amtsgericht) of Charlottenburg, arguing that the announced debt-to-equity swap should, in its view, not be implemented. Additionally, the costs incurred with the realization of these synergies could be higher than currently estimated by the Company. However, it cannot be ruled out that the anticipated effects from synergies and economies of scale will be realized in full or at all. Additionally, the costs incurred with the realization of these synergies could be higher than currently estimated by the Company.

    Title: Shareholders of ADLER Real Estate that did not accept the ADLER Offer may take measures to delay or prevent future plans or measures to facilitate the Integration.
    Text: Under German law, shareholders of ADLER Real Estate that, following the Completion, continue to hold a stake as minority shareholders of ADLER Real Estate, have certain rights. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, approximately 6.1% of the share capital and voting rights of ADLER Real Estate remain attributable to shareholders of ADLER Real Estate other than the Company. These shareholder rights could result in a delay or disruption of any corporate structural measures intended in relation to ADLER Real Estate (including, among others, a change in their legal form, a squeeze-out, the conclusion of a domination and profitand-loss transfer agreement or a merger) and the Integration. Any such delay or failure to implement certain essential measures as well as legal disputes in relation thereto could limit our control over and our access to the cash flows of ADLER Real Estate and delay or prevent the execution of corporate structural measures envisaged to facilitate the Integration (see also “The synergies expected as a result of the Integration could potentially not _be fully realized or not realized at all or eroded by expenses not anticipated.”). Any risk in relation to_ shareholders of ADLER Real Estate that did not accept the ADLER Offer could have a material adverse effect on our business, net assets, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.

    Title: The Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information of the ADLER Group is only provided for assessment purposes and is no indicator for the future business-, asset-, financial- and earnings situation of the ADLER Group.
    Text: The pro forma consolidated financial information of the Company included in this Offering Memorandum (the “Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information”) are only provided for illustrative purposes. They should not be considered as an indicator for the future business-, asset-, financial- and earnings situation of the ADLER Group. The _Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information is based on historical consolidated financial ----- statements of the Company and, inter alia, on the historical consolidated financial statements of ADLER Real Estate and Consus Real Estate, subject to certain adjustments, assumptions and estimates. These adjustments, assumptions and estimates are preliminary and based on information that were available during the time of preparation of the Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information. For example, it is assumed that the ADLER Offer, the Business Combination, the Consus Real Estate Acquisition (as defined below), the Rights Issue (as defined below) and the Consus Offer (as defined below) had taken place as of January 1, 2019.

Does the text mention that the company is exposed to risks associated with cyclical products?

    Title: Certain risks in connection with the business of Consus Real Estate are similar to the risks of our existing business, the benefits expected as a result of an acquisition of Consus Real Estate may not be fully realized or not be realized at all.
    Text: The Company acquired a majority stake in Consus Real Estate in several steps: On December 15, 2019, the Company entered into various share purchase agreements with minority shareholders of Consus Real Estate to acquire a 22.18% stake in Consus Real Estate, which, as a result of the Completion, increased to 25.75% due to the fact that ADLER Real Estate held 3.57% in Consus Real Estate prior to the Completion. On June 29, 2020, the Company exercised its call option under the call/put-option agreement with Aggregate Holdings S.A. (“Aggregate”) for the acquisition of 69,619,173 shares in Consus Real Estate, as amended (the “Call/Put**Option Agreement”). The settlement of the call option exercise under the Call/Put-Option Agreement occurred by transfer of newly issued shares in the Company and transfer of the Company’s existing shares previously indirectly held by ADLER Real Estate (the “Consus Real Estate Acquisition”). Under the Call/Put-Option Agreement, the Company has undertaken to make a voluntary tender offer in the form of an exchange offer to acquire the remaining shares of Consus Real Estate (save for any applicable RETTBlocker). Accordingly, the Company may make an offer to all shareholders of Consus Real Estate to purchase their shares in Consus Real Estate by way of a voluntary public exchange offer (the “Consus Offer”), subject to market conditions. The Consus Offer would be based on an exchange ratio, adjusted for the issue of 30,819,391 newly issued shares in dematerialized form with no nominal value in connection with a capital increase against contribution in cash with subscription rights for existing shareholders of the Company and gross proceeds in an amount of €457 million, which was settled on July 24, 2020 (the “Rights Issue”), of one share in Consus Real Estate for 0.272 newly issued shares in the Company as consideration. Gröner Group GmbH has irrevocably undertaken to accept the Consus Offer in relation to a shareholding of 15.3% in Consus Real Estate. Alternatively, the Company may seek to amend the Call/Put-Option Agreement and enter into a share purchase agreement regarding Gröner Group GmbH’s shareholding of 20.5% in Consus Real Estate in lieu of Gröner Group GmbH accepting the Consus Offer, whereby the Company would acquire all shares held by Gröner Group GmbH in Consus Real Estate against transfer of newly issued shares in the Company as consideration. The new shares would be created by way of a capital increase without subscription rights against contribution in kind. The Consus Real Estate Acquisition and the Consus Offer are part of our strategy to benefit from access to Consus Real Estate’s development platform with a pipeline of over 15,000 residential rental units that is focused on Berlin, Cologne, Düsseldorf, Dresden, Frankfurt am Main, Hamburg, Leipzig, Munich and Stuttgart (together, the “Top 9 Cities”). There is no assurance that the anticipated benefits of the Consus Real Estate Acquisition will be realized in full or at all. Prior to the Consus Real Estate Acquisition, we conducted a restricted due diligence on the basis of limited information. Therefore, certain important circumstances relevant for the valuation of Consus Real Estate, including its internal business operations and financial reporting, may not have been adequately or sufficiently considered. In particular, we may not have been in a position to adequately and sufficiently identify and assess all risks in connection with the Consus Real Estate Acquisition and the Consus Offer. For example, in connection with a joint venture agreement, the Consus Real Estate ----- Acquisition may have triggered a change of control under a provision that obligates the Company to present its joint venture partner with an offer to sell its participation to the Company in a multi-step procedure. In connection therewith, we could incur additional costs and be exposed to transactional and legal risks.

Does the text mention that the company is exposed to risks associated with cyclical products?

    Title: The Consus Real Estate Acquisition exposes the Company to operational risks related to the development of real estate projects.
    Text: The majority of Consus Real Estate’s revenue is generated from the development of real estate projects. The development of real estate projects involves specific significant risks to which the Company is exposed by way of the Consus Real Estate Acquisition. The Company may overestimate the value of and/or the business opportunities of or associated with the Consus Real Estate Acquisition due to numerous factors, in particular the inability to identify all risks associated with the development of real estate properties. Consus Real Estate’s profitability will depend on its ability to successfully acquire land plots, listed buildings and commercial real estate properties suitable for development, either through building, conversion or redevelopment, at financially attractive prices in appropriate geographic locations and at terms that are in line with its acquisition strategy and criteria. A key factor contributing to Consus Real Estate’s future growth and profitability is the ability to identify and, at financially attractive prices, acquire land plots or properties utilizing Consus Real Estate’s sourcing network, in particular through the individual contacts of its branches. There can, however, be no assurance that Consus Real Estate’s sourcing network will be able to continue identifying acquisition targets or that Consus Real Estate will be able to maintain its sourcing network in the future. In addition, Consus Real Estate’s ability to acquire land plots or real estate properties for its business may be adversely affected by the willingness of sellers to sell at financially attractive prices, the availability of acquisition financing, regulatory requirements, including those relating to building, zoning and environmental laws and various other market conditions. In addition, the emergence of competitors with similar business models and strategies may lead to an increasing demand for suitable real estate properties and may, therefore, lead to an increase in the acquisition costs for development opportunities or affect Consus Real Estate’s acquisition opportunities. Moreover, there can be no assurance that Consus Real Estate will be able to acquire any of the identified land plots or properties on attractive terms, if at all. Additionally, Consus Real Estate may not be able to secure all necessary permits on a timely basis or on economically viable terms, or at all. In connection with the acquisition of land plots or properties, Consus Real Estate is exposed to risks caused by the condition of the real estate property and the inaccurate assessment thereof. Consus Real Estate may not be able to identify all material risks in connection with the due diligence processes it conducts. Due to market competition and limited time frames between introduction of an acquisition opportunity onto the market and the transaction closing date, Consus Real Estate’s ability to evaluate acquisition opportunities and to engage in a diligent analysis of the specifics and constraints imposed by a seller may be limited. There can be no assurance that Consus Real Estate has been or will be in a position to accurately identify, examine and evaluate all risks associated with an acquisition. For example, Consus Real Estate may not be able to assess whether the original owner of an acquisition target or any potential successor has obtained, maintained or renewed all required permits, satisfied all permit conditions and obtained all necessary licenses. Acquisition targets may suffer from hidden defects, including contaminations, or damages that Consus Real Estate was not able to discover during the acquisition process. Consus Real Estate is also exposed to various risks relating to defective construction work or the use or installation of defective construction materials by third-party suppliers or contractors. The warranty, guarantee or indemnity protection set forth in Consus Real Estate’s contracts with such third-party suppliers and contractors, and the arrangements with insurance providers to insure against certain risks, may prove to be insufficient or may not adequately protect Consus Real Estate against relevant risks. Furthermore, it may not be able to enforce claims in the respective amount, or at all, due to the third-party contractor’s or supplier’s insolvency, or for other reasons. Significant liabilities may not be identified or may only come to light after the expiry of Consus Real Estate’s warranty, guarantee or indemnity claims. Any claims relating to defects arising from or related to one of Consus Real Estate’s development projects may give rise to contractual or other liabilities, which can extend, depending on the relevant contractual or statutory provisions, for five years following completion of the development project and may not be covered by claims against Consus Real Estate’s contractors or suppliers. ----- In addition, unanticipated cost overruns and substantial delays can arise in a development project due to numerous factors, including increases in the acquisition costs for land, lack of availability and increases in the costs of building materials, adverse events affecting contractors and sub-contractors (e.g. their employees not being granted entry into Germany due to the Coronavirus or their insolvency), increases in the costs of professional service providers, unidentified property defects, and unforeseen technical and ground conditions. In particular, higher building costs than expected may arise due to the current labor market in Germany, which exhibits a shortage of qualified personnel in the construction sector. Delays can also arise during the building permits application process as, for the realization of its development projects, Consus Real Estate has to acquire a variety of approvals from local authorities, including land-use plans (Bebauungspläne) and building permits (Baugenehmigungen). Any such delay could result in significant cost increases and, ultimately, negatively affect the profitability of Consus Real Estate’s business operations. Consus Real Estate sells its real estate developments to institutional purchasers by entering into forward sale agreements. Such forward sales can, in general, be delayed due to economic uncertainty and the willingness of institutional purchasers to invest may decline in an economic environment shaped by the Coronavirus. If Consus Real Estate is unable to enter into forward sale agreements, even after letters of intent were negotiated or agreed, or fulfill its obligations under the forward sale agreements by completing the respective project development as planned, that would permit it to refinance the acquisition costs and finance the development of a project, Consus Real Estate may experience delays in or fail to launch real estate development projects. In this event, it may have to hold real estate properties or real estate development projects for a longer period than anticipated at the time of acquisition, or, alternatively may have to dispose of an undeveloped real estate property at a price that may not provide an adequate return, if any, or may result in a loss. Additionally, any forward sale agreement may not materialize on the terms agreed upon, including as a result of amendments, withdrawals, failure to make payments or terminations by institutional purchasers. In the event that the purchaser withdraws from or terminates the forward-sale agreement, Consus Real Estate must bear the costs in connection with the sale of the property. Institutional purchasers are generally entitled to withdraw from the forward sale agreement if Consus Real Estate does not meet the agreed milestones, irrespective of the reasons, including delays related to the Coronavirus. For example, in October 2020, Consus Real Estate was notified that one institutional purchaser withdrew from its purchase of 205 residential apartments in the Vitopia-Campus Kaiserlei due to construction delays. In such event, Consus Real Estate is obligated to bear the costs in connection with the forward sale agreement and in most cases will also be obligated to pay compensation to the respective institutional purchaser. Furthermore, Consus Real Estate may be unable to let residential units in its developed properties as required under the respective forward sale agreement in a timely manner or at all, which in turn could impair Consus Real Estate’s ability to complete such forward sale agreement, which in aggregate, across Consus Real Estate’s various forward-sold development projects, could have a material adverse effect on its revenue and thus results of operations. Also, Consus Real Estate may not achieve the targeted rent per square meter or the targeted vacancy rate of a development as agreed under the forward sale agreement. In addition, this Offering Memorandum contains figures representing the estimated gross development value (“GDV”) of the development projects of Consus Real Estate. GDV is a measure of the total sales revenue that is expected to be generated from a project when it is fully developed. It reflects the expected sales value of the fully constructed and let development. The metric provides investors with the sense of scale of the business and of the total income to be generated from the portfolio.

Does the text mention that the company is exposed to risks associated with cyclical products?

    Title: Prior to the Consus Acquisition, Consus Real Estate announced various transactions, including a material divestment of real estate development projects, and could be materially adversely affected by any delay in the closing of or failure to close any of these transaction.
    Text: On May 8, 2020 and May 20, 2020, Consus Real Estate publicly announced the divestment of 17 and 8 development projects with a GDV of €2.3 billion and €2.0 billion, respectively, thereby reducing the total number of development projects and the total GDV to 39 and €8.0 billion, respectively. The divested development projects primarily comprise projects located in non-core locations and have a predominantly commercial use. Additionally, on June 22, 2020, Consus Real Estate acquired the outstanding 25% minority stake (on a fully diluted basis) of its subsidiary Consus RE GmbH (formerly Consus RE AG). The closing of each of the above transactions is subject to certain adjustments and conditions. For example, in relation to the divestment of 17 development projects, the underlying agreement provides that both seller and purchaser may rescind the agreement if the purchase price is not paid by October 30, 2020, and, in relation to the divestment of 8 development projects, the underlying agreement provides that conditions include a satisfactory purchaser due diligence, the approval of minority shareholders of certain companies sold thereunder, the consent of ----- financing banks and lenders thereunder and that all conditions must be fulfilled or waived by October 31, 2020. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, regarding each divestment, Consus Real Estate is not aware of any purchaser’s intention to not consummate the respective transaction, however, there can be no assurance that the respective rescission right will not be exercised. Consus Real Estate intends to use a portion of the proceeds from the above transactions to reduce its project finance debt. On a pro forma basis, after giving effect to the debt reduction as a result of the divestments, Consus Real Estate estimates that its average run-rate cost of debt decreases by 0.3% to approximately 7.4%. Any delay in the closing of or failure to close any of the above transactions could result in negative effects on and/or the failure of any anticipated positive effects on, among others, the LTV-Ratio, net debt and adjusted EBITDA of Consus Real Estate. Furthermore, as a result of such delay or failure, Consus Real Estate’s strategy to increase its focus on residential real estate in its strategic markets can be negatively affected.

Does the text mention that the company is exposed to risks associated with cyclical products?

    Title: Consus Real Estate requires a significant amount of cash to service its debt, and its ability to generate sufficient cash depends on factors that may be beyond its control and Consus Real Estate’s debt service obligations may make it difficult to operate its business.
    Text: Consus Real Estate utilizes a financing structure under which the acquisition of land plots or real estate properties is typically highly leveraged. Its development projects require significant up-front costs to acquire and develop land plots. Following an acquisition of a land plot, Consus Real Estate incurs considerable costs before construction work commences. Real estate development projects typically require substantial capital during construction periods and Consus Real Estate is dependent on its ability to obtain sufficient capital. Consus Real Estate depends on its ability to obtain and the availability of external funding to finance its operating business. Consus Real Estate’s targeted leverage ratio will depend on, among others, the valuation of its real estate properties. In the event that such valuation decreases materially, for example, if the currently favorable economic environment for the real estate industry deteriorates, Consus Real Estate may have to refinance its current financing arrangements to continue to meet its targeted leverage ratio, which may lead to higher financing costs. Consus Real Estate may also fail to enter into new financing arrangements on terms similar to previous terms due to a decreased valuation of its real estate properties. To service and refinance its existing and future indebtedness and for current and future development projects and real estate acquisitions, Consus Real Estate is dependent on a stable cash flow. Such cash flow is influenced by various factors, including the general economic and real estate market environment in Germany, developments affecting the legal environment in Germany and other factors beyond its control. In addition, factors in relation to Consus Real Estate’s operations may negatively impact its cash flow from operating activities due to defaults of institutional purchasers in relation to down payments under forward sale agreements or cost overruns or delays in relation to Consus Real Estate’s development projects. Consus Real Estate may also incur expenditures for non-scheduled maintenance measures. Any of these or other factors may limit or prevent its ability to generate sufficient cash flow and could require that Consus Real Estate implements costcutting measures or efficiency improvements regarding operating and fundraising activities, delay capital expenditures or sell assets, each of which in turn may affect its ability to service its financial liabilities. There can be no assurance that Consus Real Estate’s cash flow generation will be sufficient to meet its financial needs and/or debt service obligations. Consus Real Estate may be required to obtain additional debt or equity financing at terms that may be economically less favorable than in the past. Any inability to source additional financing at favorable terms or at all may force Consus Real Estate to dispose of assets, or render it unable to pursue business opportunities, including the acquisition of land plots, real estate properties or real estate companies. Additionally, in the event that a liquidity shortage occurs, Consus Real Estate may be forced to restructure or refinance all or a portion of its debt, including convertible bonds, notes or other financial instruments that it may have issued in the past. It may be required to agree upon terms and conditions which are unfavorable to its business and which are a likely to restrict its business activities even further. Additional debt may negatively affect key financial figures, such as market LTV ratio, which describes the ratio of net debt to the fair value of investment properties and inventories. Such figures are typically referred to in the covenants included in Consus Real Estate’s financial agreements. Consus Real Estate currently has and is expected to continue to have a substantial amount of outstanding debt. As of June 30, 2020, Consus Real Estate’s total financing liabilities amounted to €2,720 million, consisting of non-current financing liabilities in the amount of €1,440 million and current financing liabilities in the amount ----- of €1,281 million. A high level of financial debt may, among others, require Consus Real Estate to dedicate a substantial part of its cash flow to debt repayment (thereby reducing the free cash flow available to fund internal growth through capital expenditure and to pursue business opportunities), restrict its ability to borrow additional funds or raise equity at reasonably economic terms, if at all, and, ultimately, will make Consus Real Estate more susceptible to a downturn in the real estate industry and/or general economic conditions.

    Title: Consus Real Estate has recorded substantial goodwill, which could be subject to impairments.
    Text: As of June 30, 2020, Consus Real Estate recorded goodwill in the amount of €1,036 million. Goodwill is recognized as an intangible asset and is subject to an impairment review, which takes place at least annually, or upon the occurrence of significant events or changes in circumstances that indicate an impairment. For purposes of impairment testing following an acquisition, goodwill is allocated to a cash-generating unit (usually a country or a region) that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the acquisition. In testing goodwill, economic factors play an important role, including the global economic development or interest rates. Any negative development in relation to economic factors could necessitate an impairment test and require Consus Real Estate to reduce its goodwill or such reduction may occur during the annual impairment review. There can be no assurance that the Consus Real Estate Acquisition or the occurrence of other significant events or changes in circumstances will not result in a significant goodwill impairment.

    Text: As of June 30, 2020, the current liabilities and non-current liabilities of Consus Real Estate amounted to €1,281 million and €1,440 million, respectively. Some of the corresponding financing agreements and certain other agreements of Consus Real Estate include so-called change-of-control provisions that are triggered by the Consus Real Estate Acquisition and provide the other parties to the agreements with a right to demand early redemption or to declare the termination. Additionally, any financing agreement and other agreement entered into by Consus Real Estate could include additional termination rights that may be triggered in connection with the Consus Real Estate Acquisition (such as, among others, cross-default provisions that allow the lender to accelerate a loan or other agreement of Consus Real Estate if other liabilities of Consus Real Estate have not been paid, are accelerated). In the case of contracts that provide for termination- or redemption rights, the other party to the contract could exercise its rights following the Consus Real Estate Acquisition. To the extent Consus Real Estate terminates financing agreements or such financing agreements must be repaid otherwise, we could decide to refinance any of the existing financing agreements of Consus Real Estate. In case of the termination of existing financings due to a change of control of Consus Real Estate, the Company has entered into the Bridge Facility Agreement. However, there can be no assurance that we will be in a position to refinance financing agreements beyond the amount available to us under the Bridge Facility. Additionally, in that case, we may not be in a position to refinance our own business and the conditions of a refinancing by the Company could be negatively affected. The termination of contracts of Consus Real Estate could result in Consus Real Estate’s obligation to pay prepayment penalties. Furthermore, Consus Real Estate could be required to re-negotiate certain agreements and accept less favorable terms.

    Title: We may face additional legal risks in relation to development projects in connection with the Consus Acquisition.
    Text: The Consus Group’s business is exposed to the risk of non-compliance with building codes or environmental regulations. These regulations are frequently implemented retro-actively, thereby also impacting previously built real estate properties. There can be no assurance that all building codes or environmental regulations were, or are, complied with for all of Consus Group’s real estate properties. In the future, Consus Real Estate may acquire real estate properties that are, at the time of the acquisition, not in compliance with building codes or environmental regulations which remain undiscovered during the acquisition process. There can be no assurance that landlord responsibilities relating to environmental regulations, including, among others, environmental protection and energy efficiency, will not be amended or tightened in the future. Adapting to future regulations could require implementing extensive modernization measures which, in turn, may require the grant of building permits to be issued by relevant building authorities. There can be no assurance that such permits will be issued ----- promptly, or at all. Subsequently, we may not comply with the applicable building codes or environmental regulations and ultimately be in violation thereof. Furthermore, the lack of building permits (Baugenehmigungen) or incomplete documentation thereof could have adverse consequences under German law. Any lack of permits may partially or completely entitle the authorities to prohibit the use of the real estate property to the extent that such use is not covered by the required permit (“Formal Illegality”). In addition, building permits frequently set forth certain requirements, for example, in relation to the statics or the structural stability of a building. In the event that we fail to comply with such requirements, the constructed building would not be compliant with its building permit and therefore subject to Formal Illegality. To the extent that the status and the use of the property is not in line with currently applicable laws (“Material Illegality”), any missing permits may not be granted. In the event of Material Illegality, there is no protection from the limitation of the use of the property and a partial or complete demolition of the existing real estate property may be ordered by the respective authorities. In the case of Formal Illegality and/or Material Illegality, sole discretion rests with the relevant authorities to decide to what extent to intervene, if at all. However, even if the authorities do not intervene, the existence of any of these circumstances may have an adverse effect on Consus Real Estate’s ability to sell a non-compliant development project or commercial real estate property. In addition, some of the Consus Group’s real estate properties are subject to public easements (Baulasten) or easements in the land register (Dienstbarkeiten) for the benefit of other real estate properties or persons. Public easements and easements in the land register may affect the extent of structural use of a property, e.g., individual areas may not be built on or the extent of structural use may be limited with regard to inter alia permissible floor area, floor space index or basic area index. In addition, certain of the Consus Group’s development projects are located in urban planning zones (Gebiete des besonderen Städtebaurechts) which are issued by municipalities in order to remediate specific planning deficiencies or facilitate specific urban developments. The Federal Building Act (Baugesetzbuch) provides for different types of special urban planning zones, such as redevelopment areas (Sanierungsgebiete), conservation areas (Erhaltungsgebiete) or development areas (Entwicklungsgebiete). Existing properties located in areas, which are designated as special urban planning zones following the erection of such properties as well as properties which will be built in such urban planning zones may be subject to certain restrictions. Such restrictions include municipal pre-emptive rights or the requirement of a written permission of the municipality, for example, for rental agreements for a certain period of more than one year, property purchase agreements, the subdivision of a plot or the establishment, modification or revocation of a public easement. Additionally, it may be required to use the property in accordance with the aims and purposes of the respective planning zone. If one does not comply with such requirements, the municipality may initiate expropriation proceedings. Furthermore, in order to facilitate the redevelopment, the municipality may undertake infrastructure measures and may force the developer to compensate the respective municipality for any increase in the value of the properties resulting from such measures.

    Title: The acquisition of shares in Consus Real Estate could cause the loss of tax loss carryforwards of Consus Real Estate and/or its subsidiaries.
    Text: The Consus Real Estate Acquisition could have led to a complete or partial forfeiture of tax loss carryforwards of Consus Real Estate and/or its subsidiaries. According to German tax law, tax loss carryforwards are completely forfeited if more than 50% of the shares in an entity are transferred to an acquirer. An exception to this general rule relates to domestic taxable hidden reserves. To the extent such taxable hidden reserves are allocable to Consus Real Estate and/or its subsidiaries (to be individually analyzed for each company) for tax purposes, no forfeiture of tax loss carryforwards should occur if the difference between the tax equity of Consus Real Estate and/or its subsidiaries compared to the share purchase price based on the value of the Consus Real Estate and/or its subsidiaries includes sufficient hidden reserves. However, hidden reserves from participations in corporations held by the loss-making company are not taken into account in this respect. Accordingly, none or only some of the existing tax loss carryforwards may survive the acquisition and tax loss carryforwards may be fully or partially forfeited. Furthermore, the current German tax law that is applicable to tax loss carryforwards and their forfeiture is under dispute, and at least for the years 2008 to and including 2015 and for transfers of up to 50% of the shares of an entity, the German Constitutional Court (Bundesverfassungsgericht) ruled that the applicable laws violate the German constitution and shall be amended with retroactive effect. Accordingly, the legislature has limited the application of section 8c para. 1 of the German Corporate Income Tax Act (Körperschaftssteuergesetz ) with ----- retroactive effect to cases where more than 50% of the shares are transferred to an acquirer. In addition, there are pending fiscal court cases regarding the loss forfeiture rules applicable in case of transfers of more than 50% of the shares in an entity. These court proceedings may have an impact on the amount of tax loss carryforwards forfeited.

    Title: The acquisition of shares in Consus Real Estate could trigger an exposure to real estate transfer tax (RETT).
    Text: The acquisition of 95% or more of the shares in Consus Real Estate could trigger RETT. Despite possible and intended structures that mitigate RETT being triggered upon the acquisition of Consus Real Estate or any future increase in shareholding, it cannot be excluded that the tax authorities will not share the Company’s tax assessment and subject the acquisition to RETT. Further, there is a risk that RETT may be triggered if certain transactions implemented by Consus Real Estate in the past may be audited by German tax authorities and these authorities may take a different view on the legal interpretation of the German tax laws relating to RETT or if the intended changes to RETT should enter into force with retroactive effect (see above “We are subject to the _tax environment in Luxembourg, Germany and further countries of the European Union (Netherlands, Denmark, Malta and Ireland). Our tax burden may increase as a consequence of current or future tax assessments, tax audits or court proceedings based on changes in tax laws or changes in the application or interpretation thereof.” and “We are exposed to real estate transfer taxes (RETT).”)._

    Title: The synergies expected as a result of the Consus Real Estate Acquisition and the integration of the Consus Group into the ADLER Group could not be fully realized or not realized at all.
    Text: Following the Consus Real Estate Acquisition, the ADLER Group will seek to benefit from various synergy effects in connection therewith, e.g., a combined management organization, combined back office, streamlined local operations and reduced overhead costs. The current expectation of an illustrative development FFO contribution from Consus Real Estate for 2020 is between €50 million and €80 million before run-rate operating and refinancing synergies of €90 million to €104 million. This target is based on the assumption of a total EBITDA of Consus Real Estate (prior to giving effect to the Consus Real Estate Acquisition) of €230 million, which is based on the assumptions that in the financial year 2020, Consus Real Estate generates (prior to giving effect to the Consus Real Estate Acquisition) (i) €150 million EBITDA for recent upfront sales, and (ii) €400 million EBITDA from forward sales (based on an assumed 20% margin on €2.0 billion of signed forward and condominium sales agreements), of which 70% will be distributed over the upcoming 3.5 years less assumed interest of approximately €130 million (annualized interest expense of €80 million adjusted for €11 million nonrecurring impact of derivatives and €34 million capitalized interest, plus estimated impact of reduced expensed interest post-closing of disposals) and less 30% taxes. However, there can be no assurance that the anticipated synergies from the Consus Real Estate Acquisition will be realized in full or at all or that the underlying assumptions made in connection with estimates are complete and/or accurate. Moreover, the costs incurred in connection with the realization of these synergies could be higher than currently estimated by the Company. Any incompleteness or inaccuracy in connection with the aforementioned assumptions or estimates could materially affect the expected synergies effects resulting from the Consus Real Estate Acquisition. The integration of the Consus Group into the ADLER Group, which is a multiyear process, could potentially not be consummated as intended and could result in expenses not anticipated at all or not adequately accounted for and the Company could potentially be legally bound to consummate the integration regardless of a materially adverse change of its economic rationale. The successful integration of the existing workforces, IT systems, corporate cultures and corporate structures and the introduction of joint processes are essential to the success of the integration of the Consus Group. Such integration will be time-consuming and costly and could negatively affect the business operations of the ADLER Group and/or those of the Consus Group. The integration of the Consus Group could result in additional or unforeseen costs and any anticipated advantages could potentially not be realized in full or not at all.

    Title: Holders are exposed to risks relating to fixed interest notes.
    Text: The Notes bear interest at a fixed rate. Holders are subject to the risk that the price of the Notes may fall as a result of changes in the current interest rate on the capital market (the “Market Interest Rate”). While the nominal interest rate of a note with a fixed interest rate is fixed in advance for the entire duration or during a certain period, the Market Interest Rate typically changes on a daily basis. As the Market Interest Rate changes, the price of a note with a fixed interest rate also changes - but in the opposite direction. If the Market Interest Rate increases, the price of a note with a fixed interest rate typically falls until the yield of such note approximately equals the Market Interest Rate. If the Market Interest Rate decreases, the price of a fixed interest rate note typically increases until the yield of such note is approximately equal to the Market Interest Rate. Potential investors should be aware that movements of the Market Interest Rate can adversely affect the market price of the Notes and can lead to losses for Holders if they sell their Notes.

    Title: Holders are subject to the risk of a partial or total failure of the Issuer to make interest and/or redemption payments.
    Text: Any person who purchases Notes is relying on the creditworthiness of the Issuer and has no rights against any other person. Holders are subject to the risk of a partial or total failure of the Issuer to make interest and/or ----- redemption payments that the Issuer is obliged to make under the Notes. The worse the creditworthiness of the Issuer, the higher the risk of a loss. A materialization of the credit risk may result in partial or complete failure of the Issuer to make interest and/or redemption payments under the Notes. In addition, even if the likelihood that the Issuer will be in a position to fully perform all obligations under the Notes when they fall due, actually has not decreased, market participants could nevertheless be of that opinion. Market participants may in particular be of this opinion if market participants’ assessment of the creditworthiness of corporate debtors in general or debtors operating in the same industry as the Issuer adversely changes. If any of these risks occur, third parties may only be willing to purchase the Notes for a lower price than before the materialization of said risk, or not at all. The market value of the Notes may therefore decrease and investors could lose some or all of their investment.

    Text: The Notes represent a new issue of securities for which there is currently no established trading market. Although the Issuer intends to obtain admission of the Notes to trading on the Euro MTF market of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, there can be no assurance whether such listing will be obtained and for how long it may be sustained. Further, there can be no assurance regarding the future development of a market for the Notes or the ability of Holders to sell their Notes or the price at which Holders may be able to sell their Notes. If such a market were to develop, the Notes could trade at prices that may be higher or lower than the initial offering price depending on many factors, including prevailing interest rates, the Issuer’s operating results, the market for similar securities and other factors, including general economic conditions, performance and prospects, as well as analyst recommendations. The liquidity of, and the trading market for, the Notes may also be adversely affected by a general decline in debt securities markets. Such a decline may affect the liquidity and trading of the Notes independent of the Issuer’s financial performance and prospects. In an illiquid market, Holders may be unable to sell Notes at fair market prices, or at all. The possibility to sell Notes might additionally be restricted by country specific reasons. A potential investor must therefore be prepared to retain the Notes for an unspecified time period.

    Title: Transfer of the Notes will be restricted, which may adversely affect the value of the Notes.
    Text: The Notes have not been registered under the Securities Act, or any U.S. state securities laws. Consequently the Notes may not be offered or sold in the United States except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws, and Holders who have acquired the Notes may be required to bear the costs of their investment in the Notes until their maturity. It is the Holders’ obligation to ensure that their offers and sales of the Notes within the United States and other countries comply with applicable securities laws.

    Title: The development of market prices of the Notes depends on various factors.
    Text: The market value of the Notes is influenced by a change in the creditworthiness (or the perception thereof) of the Issuer and by the credit rating of the Issuer and a number of other factors including Market Interest Rate levels and rate of return. The development of market prices of the Notes depends on various interacting factors, including but not limited to, changes of Market Interest Rate levels, the policies of central banks, overall economic developments, political events, inflation rates or the lack of or excess demand for the relevant type of Note. Holders are therefore exposed to the risk of an unfavorable development of market prices of the Notes which could materialize upon a sale of Notes. -----

    Title: The trading market for debt securities may be volatile and may be adversely impacted by many events.
    Text: The market for debt securities issued by the Issuer is influenced by a number of interrelated factors, including economic, financial and political conditions and events in Germany as well as economic conditions and, to varying degrees, market conditions, interest rates, currency exchange rates and inflation rates in other European and other industrialized countries. There can be no assurance that events in Germany, Europe or elsewhere will not cause market volatility or that such volatility will not adversely affect the price of the Notes or that economic and market conditions will not have any other adverse effect. Accordingly, the price at which a Holder will be able to sell his Notes may be at a discount, which could be substantial, to the issue price, or the purchase price paid by such Holder.

    Title: Ratings may not reflect all risks and are subject to change.
    Text: Ratings assigned to the Issuer by rating agencies are an indicator of the Issuer’s ability to meet its obligations under the Notes in a timely manner. The lower the assigned rating is on the respective scale the higher the respective rating agency assesses the risk that the Issuer’s obligations will not be met at all or not be met in a timely manner. The market value of the Notes from time to time is likely to be dependent upon the level of credit rating assigned to the long-term debt of the Issuer. Rating agencies may change, suspend or withdraw their ratings at short notice. A change, suspension or withdrawal of a rating may affect the price and the market value of the Notes. A Holder may thus incur financial disadvantages as he may not be able to sell the Notes or will only be able to do so at a discount, which could be substantial, to the issue price or the purchase price paid by such Holder. One or more independent credit rating agencies may assign credit ratings to the Notes. Such ratings may not reflect the potential impact of all risks related to the structure, market and additional factors discussed herein, and other factors that may affect the value of the Notes. In addition, S&P, Moody’s or any other rating agency may change its methodologies for rating securities with features similar to the Notes in the future. This may include the relationship between ratings assigned to an issuer’s senior securities and ratings assigned to securities with features similar to the Notes, sometimes called “notching”. If the rating agencies were to change their practices for rating such securities in the future and the ratings of the Notes were to be lowered as a consequence thereof, this could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of the Notes. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be revised or withdrawn by the rating agency at any time.

    Title: Incidental costs related in particular to the purchase and sale of Notes may have a significant impact on the profit potential of the Notes.
    Text: When Notes are purchased or sold, several types of incidental costs (including transaction fees and commissions) may be incurred in addition to the purchase or sale price of the Notes. These incidental costs may significantly reduce or eliminate any profit from holding the Notes. Credit institutions generally charge commissions which are either fixed minimum commissions or pro rata commissions, depending on the order value. To the extent that additional - domestic or foreign - parties are involved in the execution of an order, including but not limited to domestic dealers or brokers in foreign markets, investors may also be charged for the brokerage fees, commissions and other fees and expenses of such parties (third-party costs). In addition to such costs directly related to the purchase of Notes (direct costs), investors may also incur followup costs (such as custody fees). Investors should inform themselves about any additional costs incurred in connection with the purchase, custody or sale of the Notes before investing in the Notes. These additional costs may significantly reduce or eliminate any profit from holding the Notes.

    Title: Because the Global Notes are held by or on behalf of Euroclear and CBL, potential investors will have to rely on their procedures for transfer, payment and communication with the Issuer.
    Text: The Notes will be represented by a temporary global note which is exchangeable for a permanent global note (the “Global Notes”). These global notes will be deposited with a common safekeeper for Euroclear Bank SA/NV (“Euroclear”) and Clearstream Banking S.A., Luxembourg (“CBL” and, together with Euroclear, the “Clearing System”). Investors will not be entitled to receive definitive notes. Euroclear and CBL will maintain records of the beneficial interests in the Global Notes. While the Notes are represented by the Global Notes, investors will only be able to trade their beneficial interests through Euroclear and CBL and the Issuer will discharge its payment obligations under the Notes by making payments to, or to the order of, the Clearing ----- System for distribution to their account holders. A holder of a beneficial interest in the Global Notes must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and CBL to receive payments under the Notes. The Issuer has no responsibility or liability for the records relating to, or payments made in respect of beneficial interests in, the Global Notes.

    Title: A potential investor may not rely on the Issuer, the Joint Bookrunners or any of their respective affiliates in connection with its determination as to the legality or suitability of its acquisition of the Notes.
    Text: Each potential investor in the Notes must determine, based on its own independent review and such professional advice as it deems appropriate under the circumstances, whether its acquisition of the Notes is fully consistent with its (or if it is acquiring the Notes in a fiduciary capacity, the beneficiary’s) financial needs, objectives and condition, complies and is fully consistent with all investment policies, guidelines and restrictions applicable to it (whether acquiring the Notes as principal or in a fiduciary capacity) and is a fit, proper and suitable investment for it (or if it is acquiring the Notes in a fiduciary capacity, for the beneficiary), notwithstanding the clear and substantial risks inherent in investing in or holding the Notes. A potential investor may not rely on the Issuer, the Joint Bookrunners or any of their respective affiliates in connection with its determination as to the legality of its acquisition of the Notes or as to the other matters referred to above. Without independent review and advice, a potential investor may not adequately understand the risks inherent with an investment in the Notes and may lose parts or all of its capital invested without taking such or other risks into consideration before investing in the Notes.

    Title: The Terms and Conditions of the Notes, including the terms of payment of principal and interest, can be amended by a Holders’ resolution and any such resolution will be binding for all Holders. Any such resolution may effectively be passed with the consent of less than a majority of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding.
    Text: The Terms and Conditions of the Notes may be amended or other measures relating to the Notes may be resolved by majority resolution of the Holders. The voting process under the Terms and Conditions of the Notes will be governed by the German Act on Issues of Debt Securities (Gesetz über Schuldverschreibungen aus _Gesamtemissionen) (“SchVG”), pursuant to which the required participation of Holder votes (quorum) is_ principally set at 50% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. In case there is no sufficient quorum, there is no minimum quorum requirement at a second meeting (unless the resolution to be passed requires a qualified majority, in which case Holders representing at least 25% of the principal amount of Notes then outstanding must participate in the meeting or voting). As the relevant majority for Holders’ resolutions is generally based on votes cast, rather than on principal amount of the Notes outstanding, the aggregate principal amount required to vote in favor of an amendment will vary based on the Holders participating in such vote. Therefore, a Holder is subject to the risk of being outvoted by a majority resolution of other Holders and losing rights towards the Issuer against his will in the event that Holders holding a sufficient aggregate principal amount of the Notes participate in the vote and agree to amend the Terms and Conditions or on other matters relating to the Notes by majority vote in accordance with the Terms and Conditions of the Notes and the SchVG.

    Title: The insolvency laws of Luxembourg may not be as favorable to Holders as the laws of other jurisdictions. Furthermore, the Issuer may shift its center of main interest to jurisdictions that are less favorable to Holders and thereby preclude or limit the ability of Holders to recover payments due on the Notes.
    Text: The Issuer is organized under the laws of Luxembourg and has its registered office in Luxembourg. A court is therefore likely to hold that the center of main interest of the Issuer is in Luxembourg. Consequently, provided _that this presumption will not be rebutted and the center of main interest will not be shifted to another_ jurisdiction by the Issuer, any insolvency proceedings with regard to the Issuer are likely to be initiated in ----- Luxembourg and would most likely be governed by the insolvency laws of Luxembourg. The provisions of Luxembourg insolvency law may differ substantially from the insolvency laws of other jurisdictions, including with respect to preferred satisfaction of secured creditors from enforcement proceedings, the ability to obtain post-petition interest and the duration of the insolvency proceedings, and hence may be less favorable to Holders than comparable provisions of other jurisdictions. The Issuer may shift its center of main interest, and thereby the applicable restructuring or insolvency laws, to another jurisdiction, which could offer less favorable terms to Holders than the laws of Luxembourg. In addition, even without such intentional shift of the center of main interests by the Issuer, it cannot be ruled out that a court or other competent authority of such other jurisdiction, will deem the restructuring or insolvency laws of such jurisdiction to be applicable and opens restructuring or insolvency proceedings under the laws of such jurisdiction with or without the consent of the Issuer. Thus, the ability of Holders to recover payments due on the Notes may be or may become more limited or precluded than would be the case under the laws of other jurisdictions.

    Title: In case of certain events of default, the Notes will only be redeemable if Holders holding at least 15% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding declare the Notes due and payable. Such declaration of acceleration may be rescinded by majority resolution of the Holders.
    Text: The Terms and Conditions provide that, in case of certain events of default, any notice declaring the Notes due and payable shall become effective only when BNP Paribas Securities Services, Luxembourg branch (the “Paying Agent”) has received such default notices from Holders representing at least 15% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. In addition, under the SchVG, even if the threshold of 15% for a default notice has been reached, the Holders could rescind such acceleration by majority resolution within three months. A simple majority of votes would be sufficient for a resolution on the rescission of such acceleration but, in any case, more Holders would have to consent to a rescission than have delivered default notices. Holders should be aware that, as a result, they may not be able to accelerate the Notes upon the occurrence of certain events of default, unless the required quorum of Holders delivers default notices and such acceleration is not rescinded by majority resolution of the Holders.

    Text: No initial representative for the Holders (“Holders’ Representative”) will be appointed under the Terms and Conditions and as a consequence it will become more difficult for Holders to take collective action with respect to the Notes. Any appointment of a Holders’ Representative of the Notes post-issuance of the Notes will, therefore, require a majority resolution of the Holders. If a Holders’ Representative has been appointed by majority resolution of the Holders, it is possible that a Holder may be deprived of its individual right to pursue and enforce its rights under the Terms and Conditions against the Issuer, if such right was passed to the Holders’ Representative by a majority vote. In such case, the Holders’ Representative becomes exclusively responsible to claim and enforce the rights of all of the Holders.

    Text: _An investment in the Notes of ADLER Group S.A. (the “Issuer” or the “Company” and, together with its consolidated subsidiaries, “we”, “us”, “our” or the “ADLER Group”) involves a high degree of risk. Investors should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this Offering Memorandum (including any documents incorporated by reference), before making a decision to invest in the Notes. We believe the factors described below represent the material risks inherent in investing in the Notes. In all of the following risk categories, the risks are presented in accordance with their likelihood, i.e., based on the probability of their occurrence and the extent of their negative impact on the net assets, financial condition and results of operations and cash flows of the Company. If any of the risks mentioned herein actually occur, the business, net assets, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and prospects of the ADLER Group and the market price of the Notes could be materially adversely affected. Additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we currently believe are not material may also adversely affect the business, net assets, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and prospects of the ADLER Group. The risks mentioned herein and those not presently known or believed to be not material may materialize individually or cumulatively and may, in each case, have a varying impact on any of the aforementioned factors, including the market price of the Notes. The Company changed its legal name from “ADO Properties S.A.” to “ADLER Group S.A.” by decision of the general meeting dated September 29, 2020.

    Title: The Group faces significant competition in each of the industries in which the Group operates and competitive pressures could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business.
    Text: The French telecommunications market is a mature market, marked by very active competition between the main operators and very strong pressure on prices. Despite growth in market size, the French telecommunications market has recently declined in value primarily due to price pressure in the mobile market following the arrival of a fourth player in 2012 and the decline in regulated call termination rates. The Group faces significant competition from established and more recent competitors and may face competition from new entrants and market concentrations in the future. While the nature and level of competition to which the Group is subject vary according to the products and services that it offers, in each case the Group generally competes on the basis of prices, marketing, products, network coverage, characteristics of services, and customer service. The main competitor of the Group in the residential and business services markets overall is Orange, the incumbent telecommunications operator in France, that has greater financial resources and owns a more extensive network than the Group’s and that is unlikely to be duplicated or matched by the Group in the near future. Bouygues Telecom Enterprises (“Bouygues Telecom”) and Iliad are the Group’s major competitors in the residential market. In the premium pay-TV market, Groupe Canal+ products are available throughout the French territory via satellite, cable, and DTT and DSL technologies. The Group’s main competitor in business services markets overall is Orange, the incumbent telecommunications operator in France. Orange has greater financial resources and owns a more extensive network than the Group which the Group is unlikely to duplicate or match in the near future. In the residential market, in addition to Orange and Bouygues Telecom, the Group also competes with international telecommunications operators such as Colt, Verizon, AT&T, and BT, which offer multinationals access to their international networks while the Group’s network is available only in France. The Group also has operations in the French Overseas Territories that face competition and competitive pressure risks similar to those described herein. The Group’s products and services are also subject to increasing competition from alternative new technologies or improvements in existing technologies. New players from sectors that are either unregulated or subject to different regulations (including internet players such as Yahoo!, Google, Disney+, Microsoft, Amazon, Apple, YouTube, Netflix and other audiovisual players, media players and “over the top” (“OTT”) (of an existing broadband internet network) players) have also emerged as competitors to the Group’s video content offering. These players are taking advantage of improved connectivity and platform agnostic technologies to offer OTT and cloud-based services. Telecommunications operators are expected to maintain traditional access services and billing relationships over which users access services from adjacent players such as well-known companies offering music, video, photos, apps and retail. The rapid success of audiovisual content streamed through the telecommunications network and insufficient innovation could lead to the emergence of other content or service providers as well as the saturation of the market, which would put pressure on the revenues and margins of operators like the Group, while simultaneously requiring them to increase capital expenditures to remain competitive, which could adversely affect the Group’s business, financial condition or results of operations. ----- Moreover, the Group is also facing competition from non-traditional mobile voice and data services based on new mobile internet technologies, in particular OTT applications, such as Skype, Google Talk, Facetime, Viber and WhatsApp. These OTT applications are often free of charge, accessible via smartphones and allow their users to have access to potentially unlimited messaging and voice services over the internet, thus bypassing more expensive traditional voice and messaging services, such as SMS and MMS, provided by mobile network operators, who are only able to charge the internet data usage for such services. All telecommunications operators are currently competing with OTT service providers who leverage existing infrastructures and operate capitallight business models, enhancing their ability to compete with businesses, such as the Group’s, which operate capital-intensive business models. OTT service providers have over the past years become more sophisticated and technological developments have led to a significant improvement in the quality of service, particularly in speech quality. In addition, players with strong brand capability and financial strength, such as Apple, Google and Microsoft, have turned their attention to the provision of OTT audio and data services. In the long term, if nontraditional mobile voice and data services or similar services continue to increase in popularity and if the Group, or more generally all of the telecommunications operators, are not able to address this competition, this could cause declines in subscriber base and profitability across all of the Group’s products and services, among other material adverse effects. In addition, the Group may face increasing competition from the large-scale roll-out of public Wifi networks by local governments and utilities and transportation service providers, new and existing Wifi telecommunications operators and others, which particularly benefits OTT service providers. Due to their ability to leverage existing infrastructure and to roll out public Wifi in a cost-efficient way, the Group’s competitors may be better positioned to offer their customers public Wifi access at attractive terms and conditions or as part of their current mobile and landline offerings, which may affect the Group’s ability to retain or acquire customers. Furthermore, the Group’s competitors may realize cost savings by off-loading mobile data traffic onto their own Wifi networks or those of their partners in order to reduce costs and increase bandwidth more quickly or efficiently than the Group can. An increase in public Wifi networks could also cause declines in profitability as demand for the Group’s network and services decreases. The following is an overview of the competitive landscape in France: _1. Residential—Mobile_ The Group competes with service providers that use alternative technologies for internet access, such as satellite technologies or mobile standards such as universal mobile telecommunications system (“UMTS”) and 3G/4G mobile technologies. These mobile broadband high speed internet access technologies may enable both incumbent and new broadband access providers to provide high bandwidth connection services for voice and data. Furthermore, additional access technologies may be launched in the future that will further increase competition or lead the Group to increase capital expenditure for additional upgrades. Providers of mobile broadband internet access may be able to offer fast internet access speeds at a competitive cost, with the additional possibility of allowing subscribers to access the internet remotely. The French mobile telephony market is characterized by competition among well-established mobile network operators such as Orange, Bouygues Telecom and Free and other operators without their own mobile networks. Competition has intensified, particularly as to price, since Free entered the market in early 2012 with a low-priced unlimited calling package. The mobile telephony market in France is currently undergoing a transformation because of competitive pricing, bundled packages no longer including subsidized handsets and the development of “low cost” brands. After strong price decreases in 2013 and 2014, which resulted in mobile post-paid prices in France being among the lowest in Europe, price pressure eased in 2015 and 2016 but intensified again in 2017, weakened slightly in 2018, increased again in 2019, and remained stable in 2020. If price pressure continues to intensify, the Group’s results of operations and financial condition in future periods may be materially adversely affected. _2. Residential—Fixed_ In the French pay-TV market, the Group competes with providers of premium television packages such as CanalSat, DSL triple-play and/or quadruple-play operators such as Orange, Free and Bouygues Telecom, which provide IPTV, and providers of pay DTT (such as Canal+, which operates across multiple formats: including IPTV, pay DTT, satellite and cable). The growth of IPTV, which is the most popular pay-TV distribution platform followed by satellite and DTT, has changed the market, opening up the provision of pay-TV services beyond the ----- traditional methods of cable and satellite, which is limited by the inability to install a satellite dish on the façade of buildings in certain areas, such as central Paris. The Group also competes with satellite television services that may be able to offer a greater range of channels to a larger audience, reaching wider geographic areas (especially in rural areas) for lower prices than the prices of the Group’s cable pay-TV services. Any increase in market share of satellite distribution may have a negative impact on the success of the Group’s digital cable television services. The Group also faces competition from satellite distribution of free to air television programming. While pay DTT’s share of the pay-TV market is currently low, providers of pay DTT may in the future be able to offer a wider range of channels to a larger audience for lower prices than the Group charges. In the broadband market, the Group provides high speed internet through its cable, FTTH and xDSL networks and it competes primarily with xDSL and FTTH providers, with FTTH currently being the most widespread technology used to access very high speed internet in France. Orange is the leading DSL provider in France, followed by Free, the Group and Bouygues Telecom. While the Group believes that it has the network advantage in terms of its fiber optic/cable network compared to its competitors’ xDSL networks, and better coverage of fiber networks as compared to its competitors, which currently places the Group at a competitive advantage to exploit the increased demand in France for very-high-speed internet in the areas covered by the Group’s fiber optic/cable network, such competitive advantage may be diminished to the extent that competitors increase the roll out their FTTH networks. For further information see “The deployment of fiber optic networks and/or VDSL2 by _competitors of the Group could reduce and ultimately eliminate the gap between the speed and the power of the fiber optic/cable network of the Group compared to the DSL networks of its main competitors.” In addition, the_ Group’s xDSL competitors’ networks cover more French households than the Group’s network and pricing is very competitive. _3. Business Services—B2B_ In the B2B segment the Group’s main competitors are Orange (Orange Business Services) and Colt. Bouygues Telecom is also a competitor in the SME segment. The French B2B market for voice services is extremely price sensitive, with sophisticated customers, relatively short term (typically one year) contracts, and vulnerability to cuts in mobile termination rates. The ability to compete effectively is partially a function of network capillarity, and certain of the Group’s competitors have a more extensive and denser network than us. In the data market, customers also often seek combined infrastructure and software solutions. As a result, the Group also competes with software and other IT providers of data and network solutions, which may decrease the value customers place on its infrastructure solutions, leading to a reduction in its prices and margins. IT providers may also partner with the Group’s infrastructure telecommunications competitors. _4. Business Services—Wholesale_ The French wholesale telecommunications market is dominated by Orange and the Group, although Orange’s and the Group’s market shares vary depending on the segment. The Group also faces competition from consortiums of telecommunications operators and construction companies, such as Covage, Vinci, Eiffage and Axiom (who may lay down fiber in construction sites and then lease them on the wholesale market). The wholesale market for data services in France is less volatile than the voice market. Competition is based primarily, in addition to price, on service quality and technological advancement. The wholesale market for dark fiber infrastructure in France is more open than for wholesale voice and data carriage, as providing it does not require having a dense, national network and does not include any services would require technical expertise. The Group expects competition in the French telecommunications industry to remain intense and there can be no assurance that the Group will not be negatively impacted by any future consolidation of the Group’s competitors or similar developments in one or more of the markets in which the Group competes. For further details regarding the competitive environment, in which we operate, see “Industry, Competition and Market Overview”.

    Title: The deployment of fiber optic networks and/or VDSL2 by competitors of the Group could reduce and ultimately eliminate the gap between the speed and the power of the fiber optic/cable network of the Group compared to the DSL networks of its main competitors.
    Text: The Group believes that one of its major competitive advantages is the power and speed of its fiber optic/cable network. As of June 30, 2020, the Group’s network passed approximately 17,457,000 fiber/cable homes, including fiber/cable homes now passed by SFR FTTH. However, competitors of the Group are also deploying fiber and/or VDSL2 networks enabling download speeds and bandwidths that could rival those reached by the Group’s network, and thus strongly reduce the Group’s competitive advantage. The Group’s main competitors (Orange, ----- Free and Bouygues Telecom) have begun to introduce FTTH networks to increase and harmonize their network speed. On December 4, 2019, Orange unveiled its strategic plan through 2025 indicating its objectives for FTTH lines to include the deployment of approximately 19 million lines in private areas (compared to 10.4 million already rolled-out as of June 2019) and approximately 4 million lines in investment areas (compared to 0.4 million as of June 2019) in addition of approximately 13 million lines deployed by a third party and co-financed by Orange by 2023 (Source: _Orange press release). Furthermore, other operators may obtain access to the infrastructure deployed by an operator, through joint projects for financing. All of the DSL operators have announced various agreements on sharing the deployment of FTTH in given areas. For example, Orange and Free entered into a contract in July 2013 providing for the deployment by Free of a fiber network using Orange’s infrastructure in approximately 20 French cities, which allows for open access to all competing operators. In addition, in 2013 the French government announced a FTTH deployment plan of €20 billion (invested by private operators and local authorities) with the objective of providing very-high-speed internet access to the entire territory in 2022. The government will provide a subsidy package of approximately €3,300 million, partly from funding from the Investments for the Future Program managed by the Office of the General Commissioner of Investment under the 2015 Budget Act. The rollout has been divided in three zones: very dense areas (approximately six million households) and low-density areas (approximately 13 million households), that are already covered or will be covered by FTTH with privately-funded networks; and low-density areas (approximately 15 million households), where private operators will co-invest with public partners. Orange and the Group will lead the deployment of the very-high speed network in privately-funded, low density areas, with the Group being in charge of approximately 20% of the network deployment. Various local and regional authorities have already extended subsidies to network operators, including the Group, to install FTTH connections. This trend should continue, as certain departments, municipalities and regions, such as Hauts-deSeine, Amiens and Louvin, for example, have entered into public-private partnerships to encourage such investments. In such areas, various operators will have access to the network and will be able to compete. In addition, in accordance with the conditions established by ARCEP, third-party operators may have access to the infrastructure used by an operator, including by co-financing projects, for their own very-high-speed internet offers. As a result, FTTH deployment by the Group’s competitors could accelerate and the share of FTTH on the highspeed internet market could grow significantly, thereby eliminating or reducing the Group’s fixed network advantage. VDSL2 technology has also been implemented in some areas by competitors of the Group. Deployment of VDSL2 only requires adding VDSL2 cards in already deployed digital subscriber line access multiplexers (“DSLAMs”) and does not involve physical intervention at the subscriber’s premises. Moreover, the deployment of this technology has accelerated since October 2014 given the favorable opinion of the copper experts committee that has allowed the marketing, starting from that date, of VDSL2 in indirect distribution on all lines from a main distribution frame (“MDF”) on Orange’s local copper loop. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 5,950,000 households were eligible for VDSL2 (source: ARCEP). If the competitors of the Group continue to deploy or significantly increase their fiber optic networks they could be able to compete with the Group in terms of the offering of high-speed internet and television services of a quality and speed greater than or equal to those of the Group, thus potentially eliminating the Group’s current competitive advantage, increasing the pressure upon prices and margins and leading the Group to make significant investments in order to match the services they offer. Deployment of VDSL2 and/or fiber optic networks by competitors also represents a risk for the business services activity of the Group, particularly with regard to medium-sized, small-to-medium-sized and very-small-sized businesses to which the Group’s DSL and fiber/cable networks network presently represent an advantage. Although the Group is preparing for this deployment by improving its product range and building out its fiber/cable network, such deployment could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial position and results of operations.

    Title: Changes in competitive offerings for content, including the potential rapid adoption of piracy-based video offerings, could adversely impact the Group’s business.
    Text: The market for content is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change. Through new and existing distribution channels, consumers have increasing options to access entertainment video, sports and other content. The various economic models underlying these channels include subscription, transactional, ad-supported and piracy-based models. All of these have the potential to capture meaningful segments of the content market. Piracy, in particular, threatens to damage the Group’s business, as its fundamental proposition of virtually all content being offered for ----- free to consumers is so compelling and difficult to compete against. Furthermore, in light of the compelling consumer proposition, piracy services are subject to rapid global growth. Traditional providers of content, including broadcasters, as well as internet based e-commerce or content providers are increasing their internetbased offerings. Several of these competitors have long operating histories, large customer bases, strong brand recognition and significant financial, marketing and other resources. They may secure better terms from suppliers, adopt more aggressive pricing and devote more resources to product development, technology, infrastructure, content acquisitions and marketing. New entrants may enter the market, or existing providers may adjust their services, with unique offerings or approaches to providing content. Companies also may enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive positions. If the Group is unable to successfully or profitably compete with current and new competitors, the Group’s business will be adversely affected, and it may not be able to increase or maintain market share, revenues or profitability.

    Title: Acquisitions and other strategic transactions present many risks, including the risk that the Group may not be able to integrate newly acquired operations into its business, which may prevent the Group from realizing the strategic and financial goals contemplated at the time of any such transaction and thus adversely affect the its business.
    Text: Historically, the Group’s business has grown, in part, through a significant number of selective acquisitions, including the SFR Acquisition that has enabled the Group to take advantage of existing networks, service offerings and management expertise. The Group may continue to grow its business through acquisitions of broadband and mobile communications businesses, content companies and ancillary services that we believe will present opportunities to create value by generating strong cash flows and operational synergies. In addition, we have recently entered into certain strategic transactions, such as the Towers Transactions and the sale of the Group’s Voice Carrier Business, to monetize the value of certain of our non-core assets in France, and the sale of a 49.99% interest in SFR FTTH to create an alternative FTTH infrastructure wholesale operator. Moreover, SFR FTTH (an associate of the Group) has entered into agreement to acquire all of the equity interests in Covage, which transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2020. In the future, the Group may enter into similar transactions. Any acquisition, disposal or other strategic transaction the Group may undertake in the future could result in the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities and an increase in interest expenses, amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets or in the use by us of available cash on hand to finance any such acquisitions. The Group may experience difficulties in integrating acquired operations into the Group’s business, incur higher than expected costs or fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits or synergies of these acquisitions, if any. Such transactions may also disrupt the Group’s relationships with current and new employees, customers and suppliers. In addition, the Group’s management may be distracted by such acquisitions and the integration of acquired businesses. Thus, if the Group consummates any further acquisitions or fail to integrate any previous acquisitions, there could be a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in completing business acquisitions or integrating previously acquired companies. In addition, the Group’s debt burden may increase if we borrow funds to finance any future transactions, which could have a negative impact on the Group’s cash flows and the Group’s ability to finance our overall operations. Acquisitions or disposals of additional telecommunications companies may require the approval of governmental authorities (either domestically or, in the case of the EU, at the EU level), which can block, impose conditions on, or delay the process which could result in a failure on our part to proceed with announced transactions on a timely basis or at all, thus hampering our opportunities for growth. In the event conditions are imposed and we fail to meet them in a timely manner, the relevant governmental authority may impose fines and, if in connection with a merger transaction, may require restorative measures, such as mandatory disposition of assets or divestiture of operations. Although we analyze and conduct due diligence on acquisition targets, our assessments are subject to a number of assumptions concerning profitability, growth, interest rates and company valuations and our inquiries may fail to uncover relevant information. There can be no assurance that our assessments or due diligence of and assumptions regarding acquisition targets will prove to be correct, and actual developments may differ significantly from our expectations. Moreover, our plans to acquire additional businesses in the future are subject to the availability of suitable opportunities. The Group’s competitors may also follow similar acquisition strategies and may have greater financial resources available for investments or may be willing to accept less favorable terms than we can accept, which may prevent us from acquiring businesses that we target to the benefit of our competitors. ----- The operating complexity of the Group’s business and the responsibilities of management have increased significantly as a result of the growth of our business through acquisitions, which may place significant strain on our managerial and operational resources. The Group may be unable to allocate sufficient managerial and operational resources to meet our needs as our business grows, and our current operational and financial systems and managerial controls and procedures may become inadequate. Although the Group considers the operational and financial systems and managerial controls and procedures that we currently have in place to be adequate for the Group’s purposes, we recognize that the effectiveness of these systems, controls and procedures needs to be kept under regular review as the Group’s business grows. The Group will have to maintain close coordination among our logistical, technical, accounting, finance, marketing and sales personnel. Management of growth will also require, among other things, continued development of financial and management controls and information technology systems. The constant growth may strain our managerial resources which may require the Group to hire additional managerial resources. The Group may be unable to hire managers with the relevant expertise or the hiring process may require significant time and resources, all of which could result in a disruption in the Group’s management, growth, operational and financial systems, managerial controls and procedures and, accordingly, the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations. The Group periodically evaluates, and has engaged in, the disposition of certain non-core assets and businesses. Divestitures could involve difficulties in the separation of operations, services, products and personnel, the diversion of management’s attention, the disruption of our business and the potential loss of key employees. After reaching an agreement with a buyer for the disposition of a business, the transaction may be subject to the satisfaction of pre-closing conditions as well as to obtaining necessary regulatory and government approvals, which, if not satisfied or obtained, may prevent us from completing the transaction. Divestitures may also involve continued financial involvement in the divested assets and businesses, such as indemnities or other financial obligations, in which the performance of the divested assets or businesses could impact our results of operations. Any divestiture the Group undertakes could adversely affect the Group’s financial condition and results of operations. In certain cases, the Group has entered into or may enter into joint venture arrangements with a majority or minority interest in such joint ventures. Even in cases where the Group has retained a majority interest, the joint venture partner may have significant influence over policies, including consent rights with respect to certain specified matters. The Group has a lesser degree of control over the business operations of the joint ventures and businesses in which it has made minority investments.

    Title: The Group might not be able to effectively implement or adapt its business strategy.
    Text: The Group has based its strategy on its vision of the market, especially the importance of very-high-speed fiber/cable and mobile networks and of fixed-mobile convergence. At the core of the Group’s strategy has been revenue, profitability and cash flow growth. Key elements of this strategy have included: (i) operational and financial turnaround under the leadership of a new management team; (ii) optimizing commercial performance with a particular focus on customer services; (iii) continuing to invest in best-in-class infrastructure commensurate with its market position; and (iv) monetizing content investments through various pay-TV models and growing advertising revenue. However, the Group is evolving in a market affected by economic, competitive and regulatory uncertainty and the Group must regularly adapt its business model to take into account market changes such as changes in consumer behavior, introduction of new technology, products or services, competition and the development of specific pricing policies, the adaptation of its structural costs, the streamlining of its operational organization, and the adaptation of its sales strategy. If the measures taken by the Group do not meet the demands, expectations, or habits of the consumer, it will have an adverse effect on the return on investments, financial targets, market share, and revenues generated. Consequently, any development of the Group’s business strategy that proves not to be sufficiently adapted to the actual trends and demands, expectations, or habits of the consumer in the telecommunications market may not achieve its desired goals and/or have a material adverse effect on its business, financial position and results of operations. Moreover, the transformation of the Group following the execution of certain strategic transactions, including non-core asset disposals, strategic acquisitions and investments or entry into joint venture arrangements, could create operational difficulties and unforeseen expenses and could give rise to significant administrative, financial, and managerial challenges involving the activity of the Group. Such strategic transactions may also disrupt its ongoing business, cause management’s attention to be diverted and result in legal, regulatory, contractual, labor, or other difficulties that have not been foreseen or disclosed. -----

    Title: Revenue from certain of the Group’s services has been declining or not growing, and the Group may be unable to offset such trends.
    Text: The Group’s total revenues and revenues in the residential fixed, residential mobile, business services and media segments declined in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. While the Group’s total revenues increased for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31 2018, there was a decrease in revenues in the residential-fixed and media segments. Similarly, while the Group’s total revenue increased for the six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2019, there was a decrease in revenues in the equipment sales and media segments. The Group’s Adjusted EBITDA remained flat for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 and for the six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to June 30, 2019, but increased for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. While the Group is focused on achieving an operational financial turnaround, there can be no assurance that this trend of declines in revenue will not continue in future periods. The Group expects its DSL business with Bouygues Telecom to continue to decline. In particular, churn in Bouygues Telecom’s DSL white label customers has already led to a decrease in white label subscribers. If the revenue and profitability loss from such businesses is not offset by revenue and profitability growth in other Group businesses, this could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business activities, the results of its operation and financial condition. In addition, the Group could experience further decreases in customers on its DSL network in the future due to their migration to fiber/cable networks providing them with access to greater internet speeds compared with those available on DSL networks. If the revenue and profitability loss from customers on the Group’s DSL network is not offset by revenue and profitability growth on the Group’s fiber/cable network, this could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business activities, the results of operation and financial condition.

    Title: Customer churn, or the threat of customer churn, may adversely affect the Group’s business.
    Text: The Group’s ability to attract and retain subscribers to its services or to increase profitability from existing subscribers will depend in large part on the Group’s ability to stimulate and increase subscriber usage, convince subscribers to switch from competitors’ services to our services and the Group’s ability to minimize customer churn. Customer churn is a measure of the number of customers who stop subscribing for one or more of our products or services. Churn arises mainly as a result of the contractual subscription period (generally 12 months in the residential segments and between one and three years in the business services market), competitive influences, the relocation of clients outside of the Group’s network area (which is less extensive than our competitors), introduction of new products and technologies, deterioration of personal financial circumstances, price increases and regulatory developments. Customer churn may also increase if the Group is unable to deliver satisfactory services over its network, or if it modifies the types of services it makes available in a certain region. In addition, customer churn also arises upon the cancellation of services to customers who are delinquent in their payments to the Group. In addition, the Group outsources many of its customer service functions to third party contractors over which the Group has less control than if it were performing those tasks itself. The Group has experienced significant churn in mobile and fixed customers in recent years due to intense competition. Moreover, the churn rate in the Group’s white label business may increase for reasons outside the Group’s control (as it is not involved in client services and retention). In particular, churn in Bouygues Telecom’s DSL white label customers has already led to a decrease in white label subscribers, which is expected to continue in the long term. See “Business of the Group—Material Contracts—White Label Agreements”. If the Group fails to effectively communicate the benefits of the Group’s networks through its marketing advertising efforts, it may not be able to attract new customers and our efforts to attract and retain customers may prove unsuccessful. In addition, any interruption of the Group’s services or the removal or unavailability of programming, which may not be under our control, could contribute to increased customer churn. Further the Group’s competitors may improve their ability to attract new customers, for example by offering new product bundles or product offerings at lower prices than the Group, which would make it difficult for the Group to retain its current subscribers, and the cost of retaining and acquiring new subscribers could increase. In addition, the Group’s business services operations are also subject to tariff churn (i.e. an existing customer negotiating tariff decreases). Large corporate customers in particular are highly sophisticated and often aggressive in seeking to renegotiate the pricing of their contracts, which tends to result in margin pressure. Increased customer or tariff churn may have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations. -----

    Title: The Group’s growth prospects depend on continued demand for fixed-based and mobile products and services and increased demand for bundled and premium offerings.
    Text: The use of broadband, television and fixed-line telephony and mobile services in France has increased sharply in recent years. The Group has benefited from this growth in recent years and its growth and profitability depend, in part, on continued demand for these services in the coming years. The Group relies on its multi-play and premium television services to attract new customers and to migrate existing customers to such services. Therefore, if demand for multi-play products and premium television services does not increase as expected, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

    Title: The Group’s future revenue growth depends in part on market acceptance of new product introductions and product innovations.
    Text: In general, the telecommunications industry is characterized by the frequent introduction of new products and services or upgrading of existing products and services, in connection with new technologies, as well as changes in usage patterns and in customer needs and priorities. The Group’s long term results of operations therefore depend substantially upon its ability to continue to conceive, design, source and market new products and services as well as continuing market acceptance of the Group’s existing and future products and services. Should the Group fail to or be significantly delayed in introducing new products and services in the future, if the Group’s new products and services are not accepted by customers, or if the Group’s competitors introduce more sophisticated or more popular products and services, the Group’s business and results of operations may be adversely affected.

    Title: If the Group is unable to obtain attractive content on satisfactory terms for its services, the demand for these services could be reduced, thereby lowering revenue and profitability.
    Text: The success of the Group’s pay-TV services depends on access to an attractive selection of television programming. For example, the ability to provide movies, sports and other popular programming, including videoon-demand (“VOD”) content, is a major factor that attracts subscribers to pay-TV services, especially premium services. The Group relies on digital programming suppliers for a significant portion of the Group’s programming content and VOD services. The Group may not be able to obtain sufficient high quality programming, sports and other content from third party producers for the Group’s digital cable television and other services on satisfactory terms or at all in order to offer compelling digital cable television services. The Group also relies on certain of its competitors for the provision of certain content offerings. In addition, to the extent that the Group is unable to reach agreements with certain content providers on terms that the Group believes is reasonable, the Group may be forced, or may determine for strategic or business reasons, to remove such content from its line-up and may decide to replace it with other programming, which may not be available on acceptable terms or be as attractive to customers. There can be no assurance that the Group’s expiring programming and other content contracts will be renewed on favorable or comparable terms or at all, or that the rights the Group negotiates will be adequate for it to execute the Group’s business strategy. The inability to obtain high quality content, may also limit the Group’s ability to migrate customers from lower tier programming to higher tier products, thereby inhibiting the Group’s ability to execute its business strategy. Any or all of these factors could result in reduced demand for, and lower revenue and profitability from, the Group’s digital cable television and other content services. Programming and content-related costs are one of the Group’s largest categories of expenses. In recent years, the cost of programming in the cable and satellite video industries has increased significantly and is expected to continue to increase, particularly with respect to costs for sports programming and broadcast networks. The Group may not be able to pass these increased programming costs on to the Group’s subscribers due to the increasingly competitive environment that the Group operates in. If the Group is unable to pass these increased programming costs on to its subscribers, its business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. Moreover, programming costs typically include a minimum guaranteed amount and a variable amount related directly to the number of subscribers to whom the programming is provided, which may affect the Group’s ability to negotiate lower per-subscriber programming costs and which could impact the Group’s operating margins. The expiration dates of the Group’s various programming contracts are staggered, which results in the expiration of a portion of its programming contracts throughout each year. The Group may not be able to renegotiate these agreements on terms as favorable as those of the current agreements, or at all, which could result in a decline in the revenue generated or an increase in the Group’s costs deriving from broadcaster licences. The Group attempts to control its programming costs and, therefore, the cost of the video services it charges to its customers, by negotiating favorable terms for the renewal of its affiliation agreements with programmers. To the ----- extent the Group is unable to reach agreements with certain programmers on terms it believes are reasonable, the Group may be forced to, or determine for strategic reasons to, remove certain programming from its line-up and may decide to replace such programming with alternatives which may not be as attractive to consumers or available on acceptable terms. Such negotiations have in the past and may in the future affect the Group’s carriage of particular programming services. Some of the Group’s programming contracts require it to pay prices for the programming based on a guaranteed minimum number of subscribers, even if that number is larger than the number of actual subscribers, whereas some of the Group’s programming contracts are based on a flat fee irrespective of the popularity of the content purchased under such contract. As a result, if the Group misjudges anticipated demand for the programming or if the programming it acquires does not attract the number of viewers anticipated, the profitability of the Group’s television services may be impaired. Furthermore, as the Group purchases a significant portion of its content from various content providers under relatively short term contracts, the prices the Group pays to purchase such content is subject to change and may increase significantly in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s results of operations. Furthermore, program providers and broadcasters may elect to distribute their programming through other distribution platforms, such as satellite platforms, digital terrestrial broadcasting or IPTV, or may enter into exclusive arrangements with other distributors. Such actions may inconvenience some of the Group’s subscribers and can lead to customer dissatisfaction and, in certain cases, the loss of customers, which may have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, as long as the Group continues to develop its VOD and other interactive services, its ability to acquire programs for its free VOD offerings (replay), VOD by subscription, and one-time VOD will become more and more crucial and will depend on the ability of the Group to maintain a relationship and cooperation with content providers and broadcasters, for both standard-definition as well as HD content. If the Group cannot obtain and keep competitive programs at attractive prices on its networks, demand for its services could decline, thus limiting its ability to maintain or increase the revenue. A loss of programs or an inability to ensure the availability of premium content under favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on the business activities of the Group, its financial position and its results of operations.

Does the text mention that the company is exposed to risks associated with cyclical products?

    Title: The Group’s business is capital-intensive and its capital expenditures may not generate a positive return or the Group may be unable or unwilling to make additional capital expenditures.
    Text: The Group’s business demands significant capital expenditures to add customers to our networks, including expenditures relating to equipment and labor. In particular, the Group incurs significant capital expenses for the deployment of new technologies such as 4G and 5G (for the purchase of frequencies and the deployment of network infrastructures) for its mobile operations and fiber optics (for the deployment of the fiber infrastructure) and for its fixed operations. Moreover, as spectrum auctions are infrequent and the Group may need additional spectrum in the future, the Group will likely participate in future spectrum auctions even though it might not, at the time of auction, require additional spectrum capacity. Such participation would require significant capital expenditures in the near term as acquiring spectrum is expensive, due in part to the fact that spectrum availability is limited. Furthermore, new technologies and the use of multiple applications increasing customers’ bandwidth requirements could lead to saturation of the networks and require telecommunications operators to make additional investments to increase the capacity of their infrastructures. Moreover, the Group regularly invests in the content that we offer in order to provide our subscribers with a flexible and diverse range of programming and other content options, including high-quality local content and exclusive premium content, in order to reduce churn. For example, the structure of the French telecommunications market does not allow telecommunications operators to pass along their investment costs to the end consumer in proportion to the volume of data consumed. Accordingly, telecommunications operators may not benefit from increased revenues from the growing demand for data and content even though they incur the costs of such demand through their investments in infrastructure. The Group is also bound by certain obligations of access and/or coverage for its fiber/cable and/or mobile network, particularly under its mobile licences, such as obligations to allow roaming or sharing of networks in certain deployment zones. This requires the Group to make significant and frequent investments and the conditions for ----- the implementation of these obligations, including some prices (such as roaming rates), may be regulated within the EU. Given such constraints, the Group may not be able to operate its network under economically favorable conditions, which could affect the profitability of its investments. The Group may be subject to similar obligations in the future, which could have a material effect on the manner in which the Group operates its business and, accordingly, on its outlook, financial position or results of operations. It cannot be guaranteed that the Group will continue to have sufficient resources to maintain the quality of its network and of its other products and services, and to expand the Group’s network coverage, which are key elements for its growth of over the long term. Unforeseen investment expenses, an inability to finance them at an acceptable cost or even an inability to make profitable investments could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, outlook, financial position or results of operations.

    Title: The Group is subject to increasing operating costs and inflation risks which may adversely affect its earnings.
    Text: While the Group generally attempts to increase our subscription rates to offset increases in operating costs, there is no assurance that it will be able to do so due to competitive and other factors. Therefore, operating costs may rise faster than associated revenue, resulting in a material negative impact on the Group’s cash flow and results of operations. The Group is also affected by inflationary increases in salaries, wages, benefits and other administrative costs which the Group may not be in a position to pass on to its customers, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations.

    Title: The continuity of the Group’s services strongly depends on the proper functioning of its IT and network infrastructure and any failure of this infrastructure could have a material adverse effect on the business of the Group, its financial position and its results of operations.
    Text: The reliability and quality (both in terms of service as well as availability) of the Group’s information systems and networks, particularly for its mobile and fixed businesses, are key components of its business activities, the continuity of its services and the confidence of its customers. More specifically, the unavailability or failure of information systems used by the Group, the Group’s network, the production of “electronic” communications services and television, the Group’s website, and the customer service function of the Group, could significantly disrupt the Group’s business. A flood, fire, other natural disaster, war, act of terrorism, power failure, cyber-attack, computer virus or other catastrophe affecting a portion of the Group’s network could have a material adverse impact on its business and its relations with customers. For example, the Group’s business in the French Overseas Territories has experienced network disruptions and other adverse effects in the past, and may experience network disruption and other adverse effects in the future, as a result of extreme weather and other environmental conditions. Measures with the aim of remedying such disasters, safety and security measures, or measures for protecting service continuity that have been undertaken or may be undertaken in the future by the Group, as well as the effects thereof on the performance of its network, could be insufficient to avoid losses. The Group is insured against operating losses only up to a capped amount, any disaster or other damage affecting the network of the Group could result in significant uninsured losses. The Group’s network may be subjected to disruptions and to significant technological problems, and such difficulties could escalate over time. For example, although the Group’s cable networks are generally built in resilient rings to ensure the continuity of network availability in the event of any damage to its underground fibers, if any ring is cut twice in different locations, transmission signals will not be able to pass through, which could cause significant damage to the Group’s business. In the event of a power outage or other shortage, we do not have a back up or alternative supply source for all of the Group’s network components. The occurrence of any such event could cause interruptions in service or reduce capacity for customers, either of which could reduce the Group’s revenue or cause the Group to incur additional expenses. In addition, the occurrence of any such event may subject us to penalties and other sanctions imposed by regulators. Further, the Group may incur costs and revenue losses associated with the unauthorized use of the Group’s networks, including administrative and capital costs associated with the unpaid use of the Group’s networks as well as with detecting, monitoring and reducing the incidences of fraud. Fraud also impacts interconnection costs, capacity costs, administrative costs and payments to other carriers for unbillable fraudulent roaming charges. In addition, the Group’s business depends on certain crucial systems, particularly its network operations center and its billing and customer service systems. In particular, the support for a large number of systems critical to the network of the Group is located at a relatively limited number of sites. While the Group has extensive backup systems, the risk that these systems may not be sufficient to handle a spike in activity cannot be ruled out, which could lead to a slowdown or unavailability of IT systems for a period of time and, when involving the business ----- services customers of the Group, to financial penalties. Moreover, the Group may incur legal penalties and reputational damages to the extent that any accident or security breach results in a loss of or damage to customers’ data or applications or the inappropriate disclosure of confidential information. Moreover, the technical projects of the Group that are in progress, involving both information systems and networks, and the plans for migrations planned in the short and medium terms for certain pieces of mobile network equipment, may generate an increased risk of failures of networks and information systems. In particular, the quality of the networks could be impacted by the deployment of the 4G network as well as by the concurrent work of renovating 2G and 3G networks, requiring, among other things, frequent technical interventions. Such work could also result in breakdowns or interruptions in services for the customers of the Group. Furthermore, the development of the resources used by consumers (for example, videoconferencing, telepresence, and cloud computing for business services customers), of the “Internet of Things”, and of new terminals (smartphones, tablets, etc.) may generate risks of saturating the networks due to the large volumes of data that such resources generate or promote the use of. The end-of-year period is an extremely sensitive sales period. A major failure of the information systems or of any component of the chain of production and logistics during that period would have negative consequences on revenues. To reduce the likelihood of this type of risk occurring, the Group avoids changes to the network and information systems during this period of the year (starting in mid-November until the end of the year), however, there can be no assurance that there will be no failure of the Group’s network and information systems during the end-of-year period. Should all or some of the risks described above materialize, this could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

Does the text mention that the company is exposed to risks associated with cyclical products?

    Title: The Group depends on hardware, software and other providers of outsourced services, who may discontinue their services or products, seek to charge the Group prices that are not competitive or choose not to renew contracts with the Group.
    Text: The Group has important relationships with several suppliers of hardware, software and related services that we use to operate our pay-TV, broadband internet, fixed-line telephony, mobile and business services businesses. In certain cases, we have made substantial investments in the equipment or software of a particular supplier, making it difficult for the Group to quickly change supply and maintenance relationships in the event that our initial supplier refuses to offer favorable prices or ceases to produce equipment or provide the support that the Group requires. For example, while we continue to promote a rapid take up of our premium multi-play services using a single set-top box, the Group faces potential risks in securing the required customer set-top box equipment to maintain this roll out as the Group currently relies on a single provider. Currently, the Group has a sufficient supply of these boxes available, but any future shortages may involve significant delays in seeking alternative supplies, may constrain its ability to meet customer demand and may result in increased customer churn. Further, in the event that hardware or software products or related services are defective, it may be difficult or impossible to enforce recourse claims against suppliers, especially if warranties included in contracts with suppliers have expired or are exceeded by those in our contracts with the Group’s subscribers, in individual cases, or if the suppliers are insolvent, in whole or in part. In addition, there can be no assurances that the Group will be able to obtain the hardware, software and services it needs for the operation of the Group’s business in a timely manner, at competitive terms and in adequate amounts. In particular, in the case of an industry wide cyclical upturn or high demand for a particular product, the Group’s suppliers of software, hardware and other services may receive customer orders beyond the capacity of their operations, which could result in delivery delays, particularly where suppliers elect to prioritize other customer accounts. The Group has, from time to time, experienced extensions of lead times or limited supplies due to capacity constraints and other supply-related factors as well as quality control problems with service providers. The Group may also not be able to recover monies paid to such suppliers or obtain contractual damages to which the Group may be entitled (if any) in the event our suppliers fail to comply with their obligations in a timely manner. The Group also outsources some of its support services, including parts of its subscriber services, information technology support, technical services, and maintenance operations. Should any of these arrangements be terminated by either contract party, this could result in delays or disruptions to the Group’s operations and could result in it incurring additional costs, including if the outsourcing counterparty increases pricing or if the Group is required to locate alternative service providers or in-source previously outsourced services. ----- The Group is dependent on various third parties in order to provide commercially viable services. For example, the Group depends on Orange to access a portion of its network infrastructure and on Bouygues Telecom for access to certain mobile networks. The Group is generally dependent on access to sites and network infrastructure owned by third parties, including duct space and antennas used for our networks and facility space (colocation). In addition, the Group’s telephony services are reliant on its ability to interconnect with the telecommunications networks of other fixed-line, mobile and international operators globally. The Group has limited or no control over the quality and consistency of the services that are supplied to us by third parties. Any deterioration in the provision of such services may affect the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations. The Group’s ability to renew its existing contracts with suppliers of products or services or enter into new contractual relationships with these or other suppliers upon the expiration of existing agreements, either on commercially attractive terms, or at all, depends on a range of commercial and operational factors and events which may be beyond its control. The occurrence of any of these risks or a significant disruption in the Group’s supply of equipment and services from key sourcing partners could create technical problems, damage its reputation, result in the loss of customer relationships and have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.

    Title: Pressure on customer service could adversely affect the Group’s business.
    Text: The volume of contracts handled by the Group’s customer service functions can vary considerably over time. The introduction of new product offerings can initially place significant pressure on the Group’s customer service personnel. Increased pressure on such functions is generally associated with decreased satisfaction of customers. In the business services market, customers require service to be extremely reliable and to be re-established within short timeframes if there is any disruption. Penalties are often payable in the case of failure to meet expected service quality. In addition, product installation can be complex, requiring specialized knowledge and expensive equipment. Delays and service problems may result in both penalties and the potential loss of customers. In these segments, the Group relies on its experienced customer relations personnel to handle any customer issues or requests, and the loss of such personnel can result in the loss of customers. The Group has, in the past, experienced significant levels of customer dissatisfaction as a result of operational difficulties. Improvements to customer service functions may be necessary to achieve desired growth levels, and, if the Group fails to manage such improvements effectively and achieve such growth, the Group may in the future experience customer service problems and damage its reputation, contribute to increased churn and/or limit or slow the Group’s future growth.

    Title: The operation of the Group’s conditional access systems is dependent on licensed technology and subject to illegal piracy risks.
    Text: In order to transmit encrypted digital programs, including the Group’s digital pay-TV packages and for billing its customers, the Group generates conditional access systems, which rely on a proper functioning of its conditional access systems. Even though the Group requires its conditional access system providers to provide state of the art security for the conditional access systems, the security of the Group’s conditional access systems may be compromised by illegal piracy and other means. In addition, the Group’s set-top boxes require smart cards before subscribers can receive programming and its smart cards have been and may continue to be illegally duplicated, providing unlawful access to our television signals. While the Group works diligently to reduce the effect of piracy, there can be no assurance that the Group will be able to successfully eliminate the piracy it currently faces. In addition, there can be no assurance that any new conditional access system security that the Group may put in place will not be circumvented. Encryption failures could result in lower revenue, higher costs and increased basic cable subscriber churn or may otherwise have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

    Text: The Group’s business is characterized by rapid technological change and the introduction of new products and services, and it is difficult to forecast the impact such technological innovations will have on our business. If any new or enhanced technologies, products or services that the Group introduces fail to achieve broad market acceptance or experience technical difficulties, the Group’s revenue growth, margins and cash flows may be ----- adversely affected. As a result, the Group may not recover investments that it makes in order to deploy these technologies and services. Enhanced fixed service infrastructure access and mobile services provided by competing operators may be more appealing to customers, and new technologies may enable the Group’s competitors to offer not only new services, but to also offer existing standard services at lower prices. The Group may not be able to fund the capital expenditures necessary to keep pace with technological developments. It is possible that alternative technologies that are more advanced than those the Group currently provides may be developed. The Group may not obtain the expected benefits of its investments if more advanced technology is adopted by the market. While the Group attempts to stay ahead of the market, closely following technological developments and making investments implementing such developments, it is difficult to forecast the effect that technical innovations will have on the Group’s business. The Group may also be unable to adapt to new or existing technologies to meet customer needs within an appropriate time frame, or a competitor may do so before us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Even if the Group adopts new technologies in a timely manner as they are developed, the cost of such technology may exceed their benefits. The Group’s inability to obtain the funding or other resources necessary to expand or further upgrade its systems and provide advanced services in a timely manner, or successfully anticipate the demands of the marketplace, could adversely affect the Group’s ability to attract and retain customers and generate revenue. Furthermore, given the pace of at which the Group launches new offers into the market and the multitude of its bundled service offerings, it may experience vulnerability to revenue leakage as a result of the dynamic changes in networks and IT systems. The Group’s revenue chain consists of a complex set of inter-related technologies and processes providing a seamless set of services to the end customer. Although the Group closely monitors the risks related to revenue loss and continuously improves controls in its revenue assurance processes in order to prevent and/or detect cases of revenue leakage, as the set of technologies and business processes grows bigger and more complex, the chance of failure increases in each connection of the revenue chain. Revenue leakage may have an impact on the Group’s ability to bill customers correctly for a given service or to receive the correct payment, which may adversely affect the Group’s margins and profitability. The Group anticipates that, over time, new products and services it may introduce will require upgraded or new customer premises equipment, which may constrain the Group’s ability to market and distribute such new products and services. For example, the Group does not expect that previously installed internet modems or set-top boxes will be able to support all the enhancements the Group may introduce to our broadband internet or pay-TV services over time. A portion of the Group’s subscribers will therefore require some form of upgrade or potentially a replacement of their customer premises equipment. Implementing such upgrades may entail additional costs to us and could delay the introduction of enhanced services and therefore reduce our cash flow and profitability, particularly where customers rent such customer premise equipment from us. In addition, we will need to expend significant capital expenditure to fulfil universal service obligations and to upgrade the parts of our networks that are xDSL. In particular, the Group must also continue to increase and improve the functionality, availability, and characteristics of its network, particularly by improving its bandwidth capacity and its 4G coverage, as well as the introduction of 5G technology, to meet the growing demand for the services that require very-high-speed telephony and internet services as the telecommunications industry in each of the markets in which the Group operates is facing challenges relating to: (i) rapid, significant technological evolution; (ii) frequent improvement of existing products or services resulting from the emergence of new technologies; and (iii) the establishment of new industry practices and standards that make current systems and technologies obsolete. There can be no assurance that we will have sufficient capital to finance such upgrades or that such upgrades will generate a positive return. The Group may also be required to incur additional marketing and customer service costs in order to retain and attract existing customers to any upgraded products and services we offer, as well as to respond to competitors’ advertising pressure, and potentially more extensive marketing campaigns, which may adversely affect our margins. Any of the above occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

    Title: The Group relies on interconnecting telecommunications providers and could be adversely affected if such providers fail to provide these services on a consistent basis and without disruption.
    Text: The Group’s ability to provide commercially viable telephone services depends upon the Group’s ability to interconnect with the telecommunications networks of fixed-line, mobile and international operators in France in order to complete calls between our subscribers and parties on a fixed-line or other mobile telephone network, as ----- well as third parties abroad. Generally, fixed-line telephony, mobile and international operators in France are obliged by law to provide interconnection to, and not to discriminate against, any other licensed telecommunications operator. The Group has no control over the quality and timing of the investment and maintenance activities that are necessary for these entities to provide us with interconnection to their respective telecommunications networks. The failure of these or other telecommunications providers to provide reliable interconnections to us on a consistent basis and under terms that are favorable to us could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of our operations. In addition, interconnection agreements and interconnection rates are normally subject to regulation in France. Reduced interconnection rates and other decisions by regulators may have a material impact on our business, financial condition and results of our operations.

    Title: The Group’s business activities and our development depend on the Group’s ability to enter into and maintain joint arrangements with other players in the telecommunications field.
    Text: _Bouygues Network Sharing Agreement_ On January 31, 2014, Bouygues Telecom and SFR entered into the Bouygues Network Sharing Agreement to share a portion of their mobile networks. See “Business of the Group—Material Contracts—Wireless Network _Agreements—Bouygues Telecom Agreement”. This agreement aims to allow the two operators to offer their_ respective customers better geographic coverage and better quality of service, while optimizing costs and investments. The first deliveries of cellular plans occurred on April 30, 2014. It was at that time that each operator first became aware of the deployment plans and technical characteristics of its partner’s sites. The French Competition Authority had prohibited the exchange of technical information prior to the signing of the agreement, and the engineering guidelines had been established on the basis of assumptions that proved to be incorrect in some cases. The discussions that followed upon the initial deliveries of cellular plans led, on October 24, 2014, to adaptation of the agreement and, more specifically, of some engineering choices that had been made at the time when the initial agreement was signed. Prior to its completion, the target date for completing the network was delayed by one year, to account for the time needed to make these adjustments in the target network engineering. The target network is now expected to be completed in 2021. The Group could be exposed to various risks related to the implementation of the Bouygues Network Sharing Agreement as it will be dependent upon Bouygues Telecom for the part of its network that it is to be responsible for operating. In particular, it will not have any direct operational control over the portion of the network managed by Bouygues Telecom that is to be shared. Therefore, we will not be able to control the quality of the network provided to the customers involved or to implement corrective measures necessary in the event of defect and will be exposed to the risk of failure on the part of Bouygues Telecom. In addition, the Bouygues Network Sharing Agreement implemented could also fail to generate the expected synergies, especially in terms of geographic coverage or quality of service. Any delay in its implementation may affect the ability of the Group to achieve the aforementioned objectives of geographic coverage and quality of service. The implementation of the Bouygues Network Sharing Agreement will also require significant capital expenditures and there can be no assurance that the Group will be able to make a return on such investment or recoup such investment. Further, in the event of partial or total cessation and/or failure of the joint arrangement, the Group would have to redeploy a network in the zones covered up to that time by the Bouygues Network Sharing Agreement so as to maintain its geographic coverage and the quality of its services. Such redeployment could represent a major expense for the Group. Moreover, the Group cannot guarantee that it will be able, in such a scenario, to implement coverage equivalent to that enjoyed by customers under the Bouygues Network Sharing Agreement. The competent authorities may, in the future, make decisions jeopardizing the overall economics and/or validity of the Bouygues Network Sharing Agreement. Third parties may also seek to have access to the shared network and take action against the Group and its partner. On April 29, 2014, Orange filed a complaint with the French Competition Authority with regard to the Bouygues Network Sharing Agreement, alleging that it constituted an anti-competitive practice. Investigations on the merits are currently underway. For more information on these ----- proceedings, see “Business of the Group—Legal Proceedings—Civil and Commercial Disputes—Wholesale _Disputes—Orange v. SFR and Bouygues Telecom (Network Sharing Agreement)”. Contract relating to the GSM-R mobile telecommunications network_ The Group holds a 30% minority stake in the company Synérail, which has entered into an agreement for a joint agreement with Réseau Ferré de France (“RFF”) for the design, construction, deployment, operation, maintenance and financing of the GSM-R mobile telecommunications network. See _“Business of the Group—Material _Contracts—Wireless Network Agreements—Agreement Related to the GSM-R Wireless Telecommunications Network”. The GSM-R project aims to set up a private telecommunications network dedicated to the needs of_ professionals in rail transport. It enables a European network to be created having a single communications system that is compatible and harmonized among the rail networks, replacing the existing national radio systems. This contract, with a term of 15 years starting March 24, 2010 and for a total amount of €1 billion, provides for the gradual deployment of this network. The Group is also involved as service provider in the operating phase of the GSM-R network. Delays in deployment caused by the Group or an inability to achieve the targets provided for in the contract could put the Group at risk under its contractual obligations to its key partners which could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial position, results of operations or outlook.

    Title: The Group is dependent on its national distribution network.
    Text: The Group distribute our products and services meant for the general public and businesses directly or indirectly through our national distribution network. Within the framework of our B2C activity, such distribution occurs mainly through our spaces. For indirect distribution of our services, we rely on independent partners, in which we directly or indirectly hold minority stakes. In particular, the French telecommunications market is characterized by rapid change in the habits and needs of customers. Therefore, the Group is committed to adapting its distribution network accordingly in order to respond to new market characteristics. This evolution of the distribution network involves regular adaptation of indirect distribution and thus on the part of all of its independent partners. However, some of them might not have the ability or might not wish to implement the necessary adaptations. In addition, the Group is engaged in significant disputes with former or current partners, particularly demands to re-characterize agreements for joint arrangements as commercial agent agreements, to obtain compensation due to breakdowns in commercial relations, and to invoke the status of management employee, as well as demands from its own employees for recognition of the Group’s status as employer and for application of the employment status applicable inside of the “SFR Social and Economic Unit” (“UES”) convention. The Group has already implemented policies for adapting its contractual tools in order to prevent such risks and manage tailored protective policies, however it cannot guarantee that such claims will not increase or that the factual or legal arguments put forward by the Group to rebut these claims will be received favorably by the courts. In particular, the Group may be obligated to apply its employment status outside its current UES convention. Such events could have an adverse effect on the Group’s distribution network and compel it to modify it. More generally it could have a significant material adverse effect on the organization, business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects of the Group. See “Business _of the Group—Legal Proceedings—Litigation over distribution in the independent network (Consumer Market and SFR Business Team)”._

    Title: The Group relies on third parties for access to, and the operation of, certain parts of our network.
    Text: The Group is generally dependent on access to sites and land belonging to, and network infrastructure owned by, third parties, including for cable duct space and antennas used for our networks and facility space (colocation). In this respect, the Group has generally obtained leases, rights and licenses from network operators, including incumbent operators, governmental authorities and individuals. For example, in January 2014, we entered into the Bouygues Network Sharing Agreement to share a portion of our mobile networks. See “Business of the Group— _Material Contracts—Wireless Network Agreements—Bouygues Telecom Agreement”. The Group is dependent on_ Orange to access a portion of our network infrastructure, on Bouygues Telecom to access certain mobile networks and on Canal+ Group, with which we have entered into a number of contracts, for the supply of content. These contracts are generally subject to rights of termination upon sufficient notice, in the event of a material breach or upon the commencement of liquidation or insolvency proceedings. In the event that the Group is unable to reach agreements with third parties or favorably renegotiate or renew our existing roaming, network sharing agreements or other agreements on terms we believe are reasonable, our fixed-based and mobile services may be adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of ----- operations. There can be no assurance that such agreements will be renewed on favorable or comparable terms. For a description of the material agreements that the Group is party to as of the date hereof, see “Business of the _Group.”_ The Group’s ability to offer our services to customers depends on the performance of these third parties of their obligations under such leases, licenses and rights. If the Group is not able to renew our current lease agreements for these sites and/or enter into new lease agreements for suitable alternate sites, this could have a negative impact on the coverage of our network. If third parties refuse to or only partially fulfil their obligations under or terminate the licenses granted to us or prevent the required access to certain or all of such sites, it could prevent or delay the connection to sites or customers, limit the growth of our offerings and influence the Group’s ability to supply high quality services to our customers in a timely and cost effective manner. In addition, the costs of providing services is dependent on the pricing and technical terms under which the Group is given such access and any change in such terms may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In many cases, the Group may not be able to find suitable alternatives at comparable cost or within a reasonable timeframe.

    Title: The Group’s business may be adversely affected by actual or perceived health risks and other environmental requirements relating to exposure to electromagnetic fields through telecommunications equipment.
    Text: The Group operates several facilities classified by the government as ICPEs (installation classée pour la _protection de l’environnement) in mainland France, particularly its data centers. The Group remains attentive to_ environmental risks that might arise or be discovered in the future and it has adopted programs aimed at ensuring compliance with applicable environmental regulations. Environmental and health concerns are expressed in numerous countries and particularly arise in the context of the deployment of mobile technology regarding exposure to electromagnetic fields through telecommunications equipment, relay antennas and Wifi. A number of studies have been conducted to examine the health effects of mobile phone use and network sites, and some of these studies have been construed as indicating that radiation from mobile phone use causes adverse health effects. The World Health Organization has classified the radiofrequency of electromagnetic fields, linked particularly with the use of cordless phones, as “possibly carcinogenic to humans”, but, to date, no adverse health effects have been established as being caused by mobile phone use. Several lawsuits have been filed against mobile operators and other participants in the mobile industry alleging adverse health effects and other claims relating to radio frequency transmissions to and from sites, handsets and other mobile telecommunications devices. The perception of increased health risks related to mobile network sites may also cause the Group increased difficulty in obtaining leases for new mobile network site locations or renewing leases for existing locations or otherwise in installing mobile telecommunication devices. The fears generated by the potential health risks connected with electromagnetic waves could also lead third parties to act against the Group by, for example, bringing actions demanding the withdrawal of antennas or towers, which could ----- affect the Group’s conduct of operations and the deployment of our network, and could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial position and results of operations. If it is ever determined that health risks existed or that there was a deviation from radiation standards which would result in a health risk from sites, other mobile technology or handsets, this would have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations, including through exposure to potential liability, a reduction in subscribers and reduced usage per subscriber. Furthermore, the Group does not expect to be able to obtain insurance with respect to such liability.

    Title: The possible inability of the Group to protect its image, reputation and brand and intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on its business.
    Text: The brands under which the Group sells its products and services, including “SFR”, “RED by SFR” and Altice are well recognized brands in France and the French Overseas Territories, as applicable. The Group has developed the brands it uses through extensive marketing campaigns, website promotions, customer referrals, and the use of a dedicated sales force and dealer networks. For a description of the Group’s brands and offers, see “Business of _the Group—Suppliers”._ These brands have been developed through extensive marketing campaigns, website promotions and customer referrals, and the use of a dedicated sales force and dealer networks. The Group’s success depends on its ability to maintain and enhance the image and reputation of its existing products and services and to develop a favorable image and reputation for new products and services. The image and reputation of the Group’s products and services may be adversely affected by several factors, including if concerns arise about (i) the quality, reliability and benefit/cost balance of its products and services, (ii) the quality of its support centers or (iii) its ability to deliver the level of service advertised. An event or series of events that threatens the reputation of one or more of the Group’s brands, or one or more of the Group’s products could have an adverse effect on the value of that brand or product and subsequent revenues therefrom. Restoring the image and reputation of the Group’s products and services may be costly and not always possible. The Group relies upon copyright, trademark and patent laws to establish and protect its intellectual property rights, but no assurance can be given that the actions they have taken or will take in the future will be adequate to prevent violation of our intellectual property rights. Adverse publicity, legal action or other factors could lead to substantial erosion in the value of the Group’s brand, which could lead to decreased consumer demand and have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, results of operations or financial condition and prospects. Although we try to manage the Group’s brands, it cannot guarantee that its brands will not be damaged by circumstances that are outside the Group’s control or by third parties such as hackers, sponsorees, or interfaces with its clients, such as subcontractors’ employees or sales forces, with a resulting negative impact on our activities. In particular, the Group’s image is increasingly tied to LaBox and its associated technology, an innovative set-top box which it sources from a third party supplier. A failure on the Group’s part to protect its image, reputation and the brands under which the Group markets our products and services may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

Does the text mention that the company is exposed to risks associated with cyclical products?

    Title: The current macroeconomic environment is highly volatile, and continuing instability in global markets may jeopardize the Group’s growth targets, have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations and significantly increase the Group’s cost of debt.
    Text: The Group’s operations are subject to macroeconomic and political risks that are outside of its control. High levels of sovereign debt in the U.S. and certain European countries combined with weak growth and high unemployment could lead to fiscal reforms (including austerity measures), sovereign debt restructurings, currency instability, increased counterparty credit risk, high levels of volatility and, potentially, disruptions in the credit and equity markets as well as other outcomes that might adversely impact our business and financial operations. In Europe, future developments are dependent upon a number of political and economic factors, including the effectiveness of measures by the EU Commission to address debt burdens of certain countries in Europe and the overall stability of the Eurozone. The current macroeconomic environment is highly volatile, and continuing instability in global markets, including instability related to international trade, tariffs, sovereign debt issues, the risk of deflation and the stability of the euro, has contributed to a challenging global economic environment. As France seeks to recover from any natural disasters and pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) or the French government seeks new sources of revenue due to high fiscal deficit, the government may impose new or increased taxes and levies. Accordingly, ----- our results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected if the macroeconomic environment remains uncertain or declines further or the government increases taxes or levies as a result of fiscal deficits, pandemics or natural disasters. We are currently unable to predict the extent of any of these potential adverse effects. Furthermore, we rely on third-party vendors for the equipment (including customer premises equipment, telecommunications equipment, network infrastructure and mobile handsets), software and services that we require in order to provide services to our customers. Our suppliers often conduct business worldwide and their ability to meet our needs is subject to various risks, including political and economic instability, international regulations or sanctions, natural calamities, interruptions in transportation systems or power supplies, terrorism, pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) and labor issues. With regard to currency instability issues, concerns exist in the Eurozone with respect to individual macro fundamentals on a country-by-country basis, as well as with respect to the overall stability of the European monetary union and the suitability of a single currency to appropriately deal with specific fiscal management and sovereign debt issues in individual Eurozone countries. Following Brexit on January 31, 2020, the U.K. entered into a transition period set to terminate on December 31, 2020 during which it will continue to apply European Union law. Thereafter, the effects of Brexit will depend, in part, on agreements the U.K negotiates during the transitional period to retain access to markets in the European Union, including current trade and finance agreements. Brexit has created substantial political uncertainty within the European Union, uncertainty in international financial markets and reduced economic growth in certain jurisdictions. It is possible that other members of the European monetary union could hold similar referendums regarding their membership within the Eurozone in the future. The realization of these concerns could lead to the exit of one or more countries from the European monetary union and the re-introduction of individual currencies in these countries or, in more extreme circumstances, the possible dissolution of the euro entirely, which could result in the redenomination of a portion or, in the extreme case, all of the Group’s euro-denominated assets, liabilities and cash flows to the new currency of the country in which they originated. This could result in a mismatch in the currencies of the Group’s assets, liabilities and cash flows. Any such mismatch, together with the capital market disruption that would likely accompany any such redenomination event, could have a material adverse impact on the Group’s liquidity and financial condition. Furthermore, any redenomination event would likely be accompanied by significant economic dislocation, particularly within the Eurozone countries, which in turn could have an adverse impact on demand for our products and, accordingly, on our revenue and cash flows. Moreover, any changes from euro to non-euro currencies in countries would require the Group to modify its billing and other financial systems. No assurance can be given that any required modifications could be made within a timeframe that would allow the Group to timely bill its customers or prepare and file required financial reports. In light of the significant exposure that the Group has to the euro through its euro-denominated borrowings, derivative instruments, cash balances and cash flows, a redenomination event could have a material adverse impact on the Group’s business. On November 8, 2013, Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services downgraded France’s sovereign debt rating by one notch to AA, where it currently stands. On December 13, 2014, France was downgraded by Fitch by one notch to AA, where it currently stands. On September 18, 2015, France was downgraded by Moody’s by one notch to Aa2, where it currently stands. There can be no guarantee that there will not be a downgrade of France’s sovereign debt rating in the future. Poor performance of the French economy, particularly due to a possible resurgence of the Eurozone debt crisis, could have a direct negative impact on consumer spending habits and on businesses in relation to products and their usage levels. Such poor performance could (i) make it more difficult for the Group to capture new subscribers and customers, (ii) increase the likelihood that some subscribers or customers of the Group might reduce the level of subscribed services or terminate their subscriptions and (iii) make it more difficult for the Group to keep its prices at current levels. Negative macroeconomic developments in France, in particular increasing levels of unemployment, may have a direct negative impact on the spending patterns of retail consumers, both in terms of the products they subscribe for and usage levels. Because a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from residential subscribers who may be impacted by these conditions, it may be more difficult to attract new subscribers and more likely that certain of the Group’s subscribers will downgrade or disconnect their services. In addition, we can provide no assurances that a deterioration of any of these economies will not lead to a higher number of non-paying customers or generally result in service disconnections. Similarly, a deterioration in economic conditions would be likely to adversely affect the demand for, and pricing of, our business services as a result of businesses and governments reducing spending. Therefore, a weak economy and negative economic development in the French markets may jeopardize our growth targets and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and ----- results of operations. In addition, adverse economic conditions (including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic) may lead to a rise in the number of our customers who are not able to pay for our services. Each of the above-mentioned risks has been heightened by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the world economy.

    Title: Our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by the recent COVID-19 pandemic.
    Text: The COVID-19 pandemic, and measures to prevent its spread, may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The severity and timing of the impact will depend on a number of factors, including the level and rapidity of infection, duration of the pandemic and related containment measures, changes in consumer spending patterns, measures imposed or taken by governmental authorities in response to the pandemic, macroeconomic conditions in our markets, and negative effects on the financial condition of our customers, suppliers and vendors. Under difficult economic conditions, including prolonged unemployment and employment furloughs, demand for our products and services could decline and some customers may be unable or unwilling to pay for our products and services. Additionally, in order to prioritize the demands of the business and/or depending on any restrictions that may be imposed by the French government on deployment of new infrastructure, we may, or may be required to, delay certain capital investments, such as FTTH or in other new initiatives, products or services, which may adversely affect our business in the future. If these events occur and were to continue, our revenue may be reduced materially which could result in reduced operating margins and a reduction in cash flows. Governmental and non-governmental initiatives to reduce the transmission of COVID-19, such as the imposition of restrictions on work and public gatherings and the promotion of social distancing, along with certain temporary regulations concerning collections, or changes in consumer behaviour, have impacted and could continue to impact our operations and financial results. Even though the strict lockdown in France was lifted on May 11, 2020, significant restrictions and social distancing measures remain in place, which continue to adversely affect the overall French economy and, in turn, our operations. If a significant portion of our workforce is unable to work effectively due to prolonged illness, quarantines, shelter-in-place arrangements, government actions, facility closures or other reasons in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, our operations could be further materially impacted. Our suppliers and vendors also may be affected by such measures in their ability to provide products and services to us and these measures could also make it more difficult for us to serve our customers. It is unclear whether measures taken by the French government to contain the COVID-19 pandemic in France are adequate and will be effective in achieving their goals. It is unclear when, if at all, the COVID-19 pandemic will be contained. We have implemented enhanced health and safety measures in our operations in line with public health rules and guidelines and industry practices to combat the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to the increase in costs associated with the implementation of such measures, we are also exposed to the risk of an increase in the number of workplace and third-party claims arising from actual or alleged failures to implement such measures adequately, or at all, and a potential increase in legal, advisory and other costs as a result of any COVID-19 pandemic related claims from workers or third party customers and suppliers that may come into contact with our operations. Financial markets have been experiencing extreme fluctuations that may cause a contraction in available liquidity globally as important segments of the markets react to the development. The pandemic may lead to a decline in business and consumer confidence and presents the risk of an economic recession in France and around the globe, which could adversely impact our results. Further, political repercussions of responses to the COVID-19 pandemic by European Union institutions as well as by other countries in the European Union could have complex and hard-to-predict consequences for the future, including a destabilization of the European Union or its institutions or a slow-down or reversal of European integration. In addition, the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on our business, financial condition and results of operations could exacerbate the other risks identified in this Offering Memorandum. -----

    Title: Changes in financial accounting standards may cause unexpected revenue fluctuations and affect our reported results of operations.
    Text: The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. These estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are considered by our management to be reasonable under the circumstances and at the time. These estimates and assumptions form the basis of judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources. Areas requiring more complex judgments may shift over time based on changes business mix and industry practice which could affect our reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. In addition, management’s judgments, estimates and assumptions and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses may be affected by changes in accounting policy. In January 2016, the IASB issued a new standard coming into effect on January 1, 2019, IFRS 16 (Leases), which has superseded the current standard (IAS 17) and its current interpretations. IFRS 16 specifies how to recognize, measure, present and disclose leases. The standard provides a single lessee accounting model, requiring lessees to recognize assets and liabilities for all leases unless the lease term is 12 months or less or the underlying asset has a sufficiently low value. IFRS 16 applies to annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019. The Group has applied IFRS 16 using the modified retrospective method, with the date of initial application of January 1, 2019. Under this method, the standard is applied retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard recognized at the date of the initial application. IFRS 16 had a significant impact on our consolidated statement of financial position from periods beginning on January 1, 2019, due to the recognition of rights-of-use related to leased assets and corresponding lease liabilities. Moreover, our consolidated statement of profit or loss was impacted as operating lease expenses no longer comprise a part of operating expenses, but instead fall under depreciation and interest expenses. The Group’s consolidated statement of cash flows was also impacted given that payment for lease liabilities is now presented within financing activities. The principal effects of the application of IFRS 16 on our consolidated statement of financial position and results of operations as of January 1, 2019, were a recognition of right-of-use (“ROU”) assets of €3,233 million which include the lease assets in the amount of €121 million previously recognized under finance leases and reclassified from the property, plant and equipment and intangible assets line items, and an increase in lease liabilities by €3,214 million, of which the current and non-current liabilities increased by €663 million and €2,551 million, respectively. The Group has completed its assessment of IFRS 16 with respect to subsurfacing rights and has concluded that in its relevant contracts, the suppliers have a substantive right to substitute the asset throughout the period of use and therefore, such contracts do not constitute a lease. For further details on new accounting standards that may have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements, see note 1.2 to the 2019 Financial Statements and note 1.2 to the Unaudited Financial Statements, in each case, included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. The Group is closely monitoring the work of IASB and the IFRS Interpretation Committee, aiming to clarify interpretation of IFRS 16, which could lead to a revision of the accounting policies applied by the Group.

    Title: The liquidity and value of our interests in certain of the Group’s subsidiaries and the Group’s ability to take certain corporate actions may be adversely affected by shareholder agreements and other similar agreements to which the Group is a party.
    Text: Certain of our operations (including, for example, Hivory and SFR FTTH), are conducted through subsidiaries or associates in which third parties hold a minority equity interest or with respect to which we have provided third parties with rights to acquire minority equity interests in the future. The Group’s equity interests in such subsidiaries are subject to shareholder agreements, partnership agreements and other instruments and agreements that contain provisions that affect the liquidity, and therefore the realizable value, of those interests. Most of these agreements subject the transfer of equity interests to consent rights, pre-emption rights or rights of first refusal of the other shareholders or partners. All of these provisions will restrict the ability to sell those equity interests and may adversely affect the prices at which those interests may be sold. In addition, the present or potential future shareholders in the Group’s subsidiaries have the ability to block certain transactions or decisions that we would otherwise undertake. Although the terms of our investments vary, our operations may be affected if disagreements ----- develop with other equity participants in the Group’s subsidiaries. Failure to resolve such disputes could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

    Title: The Group’s significant leverage could adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations and prevent the Group from fulfiling its debt obligations under the Notes or impede its ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations.
    Text: The Group has significant outstanding debt and debt service requirements and may incur additional debt in the future. As of June 30, 2020, after giving effect to the Transactions, the Group had total third party debt (excluding other long term and short term liabilities, other than finance lease liabilities prior to giving effect to IFRS 16) of €18,636 million (comprising of the Notes offered hereby, the Existing Senior Secured Notes, the Existing Term Loans, the Existing Revolving Credit Facilities, the 2019 Hivory Senior Revolving Facilities and finance leases and other liabilities (prior to giving effect to IFRS 16). See “Capitalization.” For a description of such changes to our financial profile and our third party indebtedness, see “Description of Other Indebtedness”. The Group’s significant level of debt could have important consequences, including, but not limited to, the following: - requiring the Group to devote a significant portion of its cash flow deriving from its operations to the repayment of its debt, thus reducing the availability of the Group’s cash flows for financing internal growth using working capital and investments and for other general business requirements; - impeding the Group’s ability to compete with other providers of pay-TV, broadband internet services, fixed line telephony services, mobile services and business services in the regions in which it operates; - restricting the Group from exploiting business opportunities or making acquisitions or investments; - increasing the vulnerability of the Group to a business slowdown or to economic or industrial circumstances; - limiting the Group’s flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in its business and its sector; - adversely affecting public perception of the Group and its brands; - limiting the ability of the Group to make investments in its growth, especially those aimed at modernizing its network; and - in particular, limiting the Group’s ability to borrow additional funds in the future and to increase the costs of such additional financing, especially due to restrictive clauses in our current debt agreements. Any of these factors or their consequences could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s ability to satisfy its debt obligations under the Notes. The terms of the agreements and instruments governing the Group’s debt restrict, but do not prohibit, us from incurring additional debt. The Group may refinance our outstanding debt or increase our consolidated debt for various business reasons which might include, among other things, financing acquisitions, funding the prepayment premiums, if any, on the debt that we refinance, funding distributions to our shareholders or general corporate purposes. In the event that we incur additional debt, the related risks that we now face will intensify. -----

    Title: The Group may not generate sufficient cash flow to fund its capital expenditures, ongoing operations and debt obligations, and may be subject to certain tax liabilities.
    Text: The ability of the Group to service its debt and to finance its operations in progress will depend on its ability to generate cash flows. The Group cannot provide any assurance that its businesses will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future debt or equity financing will be available to the Group in an amount sufficient to enable the Group to pay its debt obligations when due. The ability of the Group to generate cash flows and finance its capital expenditures, current operations, and debt service obligations depends on numerous factors, including: - its future operating performance; - the demand and price levels for its current and projected products and services; - its ability to maintain the level of technical capacity required on its networks and the subscriber equipment and other pertinent equipment connected to the Group’s networks; - its ability to successfully introduce new products and services; - its ability to reduce the churn rate; - the general economic conditions and other circumstances affecting consumer spending; - competition; - sufficient distributable reserves, in accordance with applicable law; - the outcome of certain disputes in which it is involved; and - legal, tax and regulatory developments affecting the Group’s business. Some of these factors are beyond the control of the Group. If the Group is not able to generate sufficient cash flows it might not be able to repay its debt, expand its business, respond to competitive challenges, or finance its other cash and capital requirements, including capital expenditures. If the Group is not able to meet its debt service obligations, it might have to sell off assets, attempt to restructure or refinance its existing debt or seek additional financing in the form of debt or equity. The Group may not be able to do so in a satisfactory manner, or at all.

    Title: The agreements and instruments governing the Group’s debt, including the Indenture, contain restrictions and limitations that could adversely affect the Group’s ability to operate its business.
    Text: The terms of the agreements and instruments governing the Group’s debt, including the Indenture, contain a number of significant covenants or other provisions that could adversely affect the Group’s ability to operate our business. These covenants restrict the Group’s ability, and the ability of its subsidiaries, to, among other things: - pay dividends or make other distributions; - make certain investments or acquisitions, including participating in joint ventures; - make capital expenditures; - engage in transactions with affiliates and other related parties; - dispose of assets other than in the ordinary course of business; - merge with other companies; - incur additional debt and grant guarantees; - repurchase or redeem equity interests and subordinated debt or issue shares of subsidiaries; and ----- - grant liens and pledge assets. All of these limitations are subject to certain exceptions and qualifications, including the ability to pay dividends, make investments or to make significant prepayments of shareholder debt. However, these covenants could limit the Group’s ability to finance our future operations and capital needs and the Group’s ability to pursue business opportunities and activities that may be in our interest. In addition, the Group’s ability to comply with these restrictions may be affected by events beyond our control. In addition, the Group is also subject to the affirmative covenants contained in certain of the debt agreements it is a party to, which requires us to maintain specified leverage ratios, see “Description of Other Indebtedness”. The Group’s ability to meet these leverage ratios may be affected by events beyond its control and, as a result, the Group cannot assure you that it will be able to meet these ratios. In addition to limiting our flexibility in operating our business, the breach of any covenants or obligations under the agreements and instruments governing the Group’s debt may result in a default under the applicable debt agreement or instrument and could trigger the acceleration of related debt, which in turn could trigger defaults under agreements governing our other debt. A default under any of the agreements governing our other debt could materially adversely affect our growth, financial condition and results of operations.

    Title: A substantial amount of the Group’s indebtedness will mature before the Notes, and the Group may not be able to repay this indebtedness or refinance this indebtedness at maturity on favorable terms, or at all.

See “Capitalization”. The Group’s ability to refinance its indebtedness, on favorable terms, or at all, will depend in part on its financial condition at the time of any contemplated refinancing. Any refinancing of the Group’s indebtedness could be at higher interest rates than its current debt and it may be required to comply with more onerous financial and other covenants, which could further restrict the Group’s business operations and may have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects and the value of the Notes. The Group cannot assure you that it will be able to refinance its indebtedness as it comes due on commercially acceptable terms or at all and, in connection with the refinancing of its debt or otherwise, it may seek additional refinancing, dispose of certain assets, reduce or delay capital investments, or seek to raise additional capital.

Does the text mention that the company is exposed to risks associated with cyclical products?

    Title: The Group is exposed to interest rate risks. Shifts in such rates may adversely affect its debt service obligations.
    Text: The Group is exposed to the risk of fluctuations in interest rates, primarily under the Existing Term Loans. In addition, any amounts the Group borrows under the Existing Revolving Credit Facilities will bear interest at a floating rate. See “Description of Other Indebtedness”. An increase in the interest rates on the Group’s debt will reduce the funds available to repay its debt and to finance its operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities. The Group enters into various derivative transactions to manage exposure to movements in interest rates; however, there can be no assurance that it will be able to continue to do so at a reasonable cost. There can be no guarantee that the Group’s hedging strategies will adequately protect the Group from the effects of interest rate fluctuation, or that these hedges will not limit any benefit that we might otherwise receive from favorable movements in interest rates. Following allegations of manipulation of LIBOR, regulators and law enforcement agencies from a number of governments and the European Union are conducting investigations into whether the banks that contribute data in connection with the calculation of daily EURIBOR or the calculation of LIBOR may have been manipulating or attempting to manipulate EURIBOR and LIBOR. In addition, LIBOR, EURIBOR and other interest rates or other types of rates and indices which are deemed to be “benchmarks” are the subject of ongoing national and international regulatory reform, including the implementation of the IOSCO Principles for Financial Market Benchmarks (July 2013) and the new European regulation on indices used as benchmarks in financial instruments and financial contracts or to measure the performance of investment funds, which entered into force on June 30, 2016. Following the implementation of any such reforms, the manner of administration of benchmarks may change, with the result that they may perform differently than in the past, or benchmarks could be eliminated entirely, or there could be other consequences which cannot be predicted. For example, on July 27, 2017, the UK Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”) announced that it will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of the LIBOR benchmark after 2021 (the “FCA Announcement”). The FCA Announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed after 2021. The ----- potential elimination of the LIBOR benchmark or any other benchmark, changes in the manner of administration of any benchmark, or actions by regulators or law enforcement agencies could result in changes to the manner in which EURIBOR or LIBOR is determined, which could require an adjustment to the terms and conditions, or result in other consequences, in respect of any debt linked to such benchmark (including, but not limited to, the Existing Revolving Credit Facilities and/or the Existing Term Loans having interest rates that are linked to LIBOR or EURIBOR, as applicable). Any such change, as well as manipulative practices or the cessation thereof, may result in a sudden or prolonged increase in reported EURIBOR or LIBOR, which could have an adverse impact on the Group’s ability to service debt that bears interest at floating rates of interest.

    Title: Changes or uncertainty in respect of LIBOR may affect the Group’s sources of funding.
    Text: Some of the Group’s sources of funding are linked to LIBOR. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Term _Loans” and “Description of Other Indebtedness—Revolving Credit Facilities”. Various interest rate benchmarks_ (including LIBOR) are the subject of recent regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. Some reforms are already effective while others are still to be implemented, including the EU Benchmark Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/1011). In addition, the sustainability of LIBOR has been questioned by the FCA as a result of the absence of relevant active underlying markets and possible disincentives (including possibly as a result of regulatory reforms) for market participants to continue contributing to such benchmarks. On November 29, 2017, the Bank of England and the FCA announced that the market Working Group on Sterling Risk-Free Rates would have an extended mandate to catalyze a broad transition to the Sterling Over Night Index Average rate (“SONIA”) across sterling bond, loan and derivatives markets so that SONIA is established as the primary sterling interest rate benchmark by the end of 2021. The Bank of England and FCA have stated that a key near-term priority for the Working Group will be to make recommendations relating to the potential development of term SONIA reference rates. These reforms and other pressures may cause such benchmarks to disappear entirely, to perform differently than in the past (as a result of a change in methodology or otherwise), create disincentives for market participants to continue to administer or participate in certain benchmarks or have other consequences which cannot be predicted. Based on the foregoing, investors should in particular be aware that: - any of the reforms or pressures described above or any other changes to a relevant interest rate benchmark (including LIBOR) could affect the level of the published rate, including to cause it to be lower and/or more volatile than it would otherwise be; and - if LIBOR is discontinued, then the rate of interest applicable to the Group’s sources of funding may be determined for a period by applicable fall-back provisions, although such provisions, often being dependent in part upon the provision by reference banks of offered quotations for the LIBOR rate, may not operate as intended (depending on market circumstances and the availability of rates information at the relevant time) and may in certain circumstances result in the effective application of a fixed rate based on the rate which applied in the previous period when LIBOR was available. More generally, any of the above matters or any other significant change to the setting or existence of LIBOR could affect the Group’s ability to meet our obligations under the Group’s sources of funding and/or could have a material adverse effect on the liquidity of, and the amount payable under, the Group’s sources of funding. See also “—The Group is exposed to interest rate risks. Shifts in such rates may adversely affect the Group’s debt _service obligations.” Changes in the manner of administration of LIBOR could result in adjustments to the_ conditions applicable to the Group’s sources of funding or other consequences relevant to the Group’s sources of funding. No assurance can be provided that changes will not be made to LIBOR or any other relevant benchmark rate and/or that such benchmarks will continue to exist.

    Title: Currency fluctuations and interest rate and other hedging risks could adversely affect our financial results.
    Text: The Group’s business is exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. The primary transactional currency of the Group is euro and most of the Group’s revenues and operating cash flows are in euro. The Group conducts, and will continue to conduct, transactions in currencies other than such primary transactional currencies, particularly the U.S. dollar. A significant portion of the Group’s existing debt is denominated in U.S. dollars. The exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the euro has fluctuated significantly in recent years and may continue to fluctuate significantly in the future. The Group has historically covered a portion of our U.S. dollar cash outflows arising on anticipated and committed obligations through the use of foreign exchange derivative instruments. Further, while we manage the risk of certain currency fluctuations in respect of a portion of our existing debt and to hedge our exposure to interest rate changes in respect of indebtedness linked to interest rates, these arrangements may be costly and may not insulate us completely from such exposure. There can be no ----- guarantee that our hedging strategies will adequately protect our operating results from the effects of exchange rate fluctuation or changes in interest rates, or that these hedges will not limit any benefit that we might otherwise receive from favorable movements in exchange rates or interest rates.

    Title: Disruptions in the credit and equity markets could increase the risk of default by the counterparties to its financial instruments, undrawn debt facilities and cash investments and may impact the Group’s future financial position.
    Text: The Group seeks to manage the credit risks associated with its financial instruments, cash and cash equivalents and undrawn debt facilities; nonetheless, disruptions in credit and equity markets could increase the risk that the Group’s counterparties could default on their obligations to us. Were one or more of the Group’s counterparties to fail or otherwise be unable to meet its obligations to it, the Group’s cash flows, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. It is not possible to predict how disruptions in the credit and equity markets and the associated difficult economic conditions could impact our future financial position. In this regard, (i) the financial failures of any of the Group’s counterparties could (a) reduce amounts available under committed credit facilities and (b) adversely impact the Group’s ability to access cash deposited with any failed financial institution and (ii) sustained or further tightening of the credit markets could adversely impact the Group’s ability to access debt financing on favorable terms, or at all.

    Title: Negative changes in our credit rating and future ratings downgrades of sovereign debt may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.
    Text: One or more independent credit rating agencies may assign credit ratings to the Notes. The ratings may not reflect the potential impact of all risks related to the structure, market, additional risk factors discussed herein and other factors that may affect the value of the Notes. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal by the rating agency at any time. No assurance can be given that a credit rating will remain constant for any given period of time or that a credit rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by the credit rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances in the future so warrant. A suspension, reduction or withdrawal at any time of the credit rating assigned to the Notes by one or more of the credit rating agencies may adversely affect the cost and terms and conditions of our financings and could adversely affect the value and trading of such Notes. A downgrade in our credit rating may negatively affect the Group’s ability to obtain future financing to fund our operations and capital needs, which may affect our liquidity. It may also increase our financing costs by increasing the interest rates of our outstanding debt or the interest rates at which it is able to refinance existing debt or incur additional debt. There can be no assurance that the Group’s corporate rating, or the instrument rating with respect to the Notes, will be maintained at existing levels. See “—Risks Relating to the Notes—Credit ratings may not _reflect all risks”._ Because the financial condition, revenues and profitability of our operating subsidiaries are closely linked to the economies of their countries of operations, we expect that the Group as a whole will also be impacted by any downgrading in the sovereign debt rating of such countries. Any deterioration in the economic condition of the other countries in which we operate or any ratings downgrade of sovereign debt of these countries may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

    Title: The Group’s long-lived assets may become impaired in the future, which could cause a non-cash charge to its earnings.
    Text: The valuations of certain of the Group’s assets in connection with acquisitions have resulted in increases to the book value of long lived assets, including property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets. Amortizable longlived assets must be reviewed for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. Non-amortizable longlived assets are required to be reviewed for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently whenever indicators of impairment exist. Indicators of impairment could include, but are not limited to: - an inability to perform at levels that were forecasted; - a permanent decline in market capitalization; - an implementation of restructuring plans; ----- - changes in industry trends; and/or - unfavorable changes in our capital structure, cost of debt, interest rates or capital expenditure levels. Situations such as these could result in an impairment that would require a material non-cash charge, which could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

    Title: A significant amount of the Group’s book value consists of goodwill and intangible assets that may not generate cash in the event of a voluntary or involuntary sale, and we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings if our goodwill or intangible assets become impaired.
    Text: As of June 30, 2020, the Group reported €34,226 million of consolidated total assets, of which €11,043 million were goodwill and €5,183 million were other intangible assets. Intangible assets primarily include customer relationships, trade names, franchises and patents, software and licences and other amortizable intangibles. While the Group believes that the carrying values of our intangible assets are recoverable, you should not assume that the Group would receive any cash from the voluntary or involuntary sale of these intangible assets, particularly if the Group were not continuing as an operating business. Moreover, we may be required in the future to record additional charges to earnings if a portion of our goodwill or intangible assets become impaired. Factors that could lead to impairment of goodwill and intangible assets include significant adverse changes in the business climate, a deterioration in our performance or a decline in expected future cash flows. Any such charges would adversely impact our financial results.

    Title: The Group is subject to significant government regulation and supervision, which could require it to make additional expenditures or limit our revenues and otherwise adversely affect our business, and further regulatory changes could also adversely affect our business.
    Text: The Group’s activities as a cable television, broadband internet infrastructure access provider, ISP, fixed-line and international long distance telephony and mobile operator are subject to regulation and supervision by various regulatory bodies, including local and national authorities in France. Such regulation and supervision, as well as future changes in laws or regulations or in their interpretation or enforcement that affect us, our competitors or our industry, strongly influence how we operate our business. Complying with existing and future law and regulations may increase our operational and administrative expenses, restrict the Group’s ability or make it more difficult to implement price increases, affect the Group’s ability to introduce new services, force us to change our marketing and other business practices, and/or otherwise limit our revenues. In particular, our business could be materially and adversely affected by any changes in relevant laws or regulations (or in their interpretation) regarding, for example, licensing requirements, access and price regulation, interconnection arrangements or the imposition of universal service obligations, or any change in policy allowing more favorable conditions for other operators or increasing competition. There can be no assurance to you that the provision of our services will not be subject to greater regulation in the future. Furthermore, a failure to comply with the applicable rules and regulations could result in penalties, restrictions on our business or loss of required licenses or other adverse consequences. Although the regulations applicable to our business vary, such regulations may include, amongst other things: - price regulation for certain of the services we offer, exit fees and cancellation charges; - rules governing the interconnection between different telephone networks and the interconnection rates that we can charge and that we pay; - requirements that, under specified circumstances, a cable system carry certain broadcast stations or obtain consent to carry a broadcast station; - rules for authorizations, licensing, acquisitions, renewals and transfers of licenses and franchises; - requirements that we provide or contribute to the provision of certain universal services; - rules and regulations relating to subscriber privacy and data protection; ----- - rules and regulations relating to our networks, including universal access obligations imposed on us, coinstallation and co-location obligations (including our submarine cable landing stations), right of way and ownership considerations; - rules governing the copyright royalties; requirements on portability; and - other requirements covering a variety of operational areas such as equal employment opportunity, emergency alert systems, disability access, technical standards, environmental standards, city planning rules and customer service and consumer protection requirements. The regulations applicable to our operations within the EU often derive from EU Directives. The various Directives require EU Member States to harmonize their laws on communications and cover such issues as access, user rights, privacy and competition. These Directives are reviewed by the EU from time to time and any changes to them could lead to substantial changes in the way in which our business is regulated and to which we would have to adapt. In addition, the Group is subject to antitrust rules and regulations and are, from time to time, subject to review by authorities concerning whether we exhibit monopoly power in any of the market in which we operate. To the extent that the Group is deemed by relevant authorities to exhibit significant market power, we can be subject to various regulatory obligations adversely affecting our results of operations and profitability. Regulatory authorities may also require the Group to grant third parties access to our bandwidth, frequency capacity, facilities or services to distribute their own services or resell our services to end customers. Currently, the Group is considered to have significant market power in France. No assurance can be given that we will not be identified as having significant market power in the future and we will not be subject to additional regulatory requirements.

    Title: Future regulatory changes could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business.
    Text: The Group is subject to the provisions of the French Postal and Electronic Communications Code (“CPCE”), which imposes certain general obligations on all operators and certain specific obligations on mobile operators. The French regulatory framework applicable to operators is also subject to the analysis of the relevant markets carried out by the French telecom regulator (“ARCEP”) which is charged with (i) defining the relevant markets in France, (ii) analyzing the markets or identifying the companies reputed for exercising significant influence on these markets and (iii) deciding whether or not to impose on these companies regulatory obligations to remedy the effects of such influence. The Group is not considered by ARCEP to be an operator deemed to have significant influence over a relevant market, except over the markets for voice-call termination on its fixed and mobile networks. Nevertheless, it cannot be guaranteed that the Group, in the future, will not be identified by ARCEP as an operator deemed to exercise significant power in one or more relevant markets, and that ARCEP will not therefore impose additional regulatory obligations in this regard. For example, the possibility cannot be excluded that, in the future, particularly in the context of a growth in FTTH networks, the Group may be required to grant competitors some access to its fiber optic network, under conditions to be determined. At the request of the French Competition Authority, ARCEP has recently issued an opinion addressing the issues raised by the digital revolution currently affecting the audiovisual sector (ARCEP opinion dated October 11, 2018). In this document, ARCEP provided an overview of audiovisual content broadcasting techniques (DTT, copper and fiber networks, satellite, OTT and cable networks) before detailing the sector’s recent evolutions at both the operator and consumer ends, emphasizing the necessity to determine a common technical framework for these new services. ARCEP has not provided a timeline for the determination of such framework and has recommended the implementation of a horizontal regulation for all devices allowing access to audiovisual content. As the technical framework develops, the Group may be subject to ongoing obligations. The Group is also subject to other individual obligations resulting from the approvals to use frequencies. See “— _The Group can only operate its business for as long as it has licenses from the relevant authorities and it may not be able to obtain, retain or review the licenses and authorizations necessary for conducting its activities.”_ In September 2017, the French government asked ARCEP to begin work on the binding commitments that mobile operators were likely to make, above and beyond their existing rollout plans. Based on ARCEP’s proposals, and as part of a dialogue with mobile network operators, the French Government reached an agreement that aims to ----- ensure the availability of a high standard of mobile coverage for every person in France. With respect to these elements, mobile operators have committed to: - improving reception quality across the entire country, and particularly in rural areas. The new baseline quality standard applied to operators’ obligations will be that of “good coverage”; - increasing the pace of targeted programmes for improving coverage, with each operator deploying at least 5,000 new cell sites across the country to this end, some of which will be shared, which will henceforth go beyond so-called “white areas” and for which operators will now be fully responsible. Over the next three years, we will bring coverage to as many areas as the total number covered by government programmes over the past fifteen years. Government authorities will work closely with local authorities to identify the areas that need to be covered; - achieving ubiquitous 4G coverage, which will mean bringing it to more than a million additional people in 10,000 municipalities in France, by making every cell site 4G-capable; - accelerating the coverage of transportation routes, so that all of the major roads and railways have 4G coverage. The agreement also provides for coverage on regional railway lines; and - achieving ubiquitous indoor telephone coverage, notably by using voice over Wi-Fi. Facilitated by an increase of network sharing which ensures more efficient rollouts, along with a planned simplification of the measures contained in the new housing bill, stepping up the pace of deployment for new mobile phone equipment will significantly improve the user experience of mobile coverage in every part of the country. On July 3, 2018, ARCEP handed down a decision (decision no. 2018-0684) setting out the conditions under which licenses for 900 MHz, 1800 MHz and 2100 GHz-band frequencies may be granted in 2021, 2022 and 2024. One of these conditions is that operators are required to take actions to achieve the goals set out in Articles L. 32 et seq. of the CPCE (digital development of the French territory, fair and effective competition between operators on the mobile market and effective management and use of the frequency spectrum). Mobile operator frequency licences granted in July 2018 are now binding and a failure to meet these new obligations will result in sanctions from ARCEP. On June 4, 2019, ARCEP updated its mobile new deal roadmap underlining the priority of deploying and/or enhancing the quality of mobile coverage on highways and other strategic transport networks. On July 12, 2019, a new decree regarding network coverage obligations was passed. This decree identifies specific interests locations (strategic sites) that must be covered by mobile networks or in which the quality of the services provided must be improved by the operators. The decree no. 2019-1592 of December 31, 2019, initiated the 5G public tender and the ministerial decree of December 30, 2019 determined modalities and conditions for the tender. 31 frequencies in the 10 MHz band will be allocated as follows: - Four blocks of 50 MHz are expected to be allocated at a set price provided the operators agree on several commitments detailed in the tender specifications; and - The remaining frequencies will be allocated through an auction process, per blocks of 10 MHz. SFR, Orange, Free Mobile and Bouygues Telecom have agreed to obtain one of the four blocks of 50 MHz (comprising five blocks of 10 MHz each). On April 2, 2020, ARCEP announced that: - the four candidates were qualified; ----- - the four candidates had made the commitments set out in the specifications, and each will be able to obtain a block of 50 MHz at the end of this procedure, for the sum of €350 million. The four candidates are now authorised to participate in the auction stage, during which the 11 blocks of 10 MHz that remain available in the 3.4 – 3.8 GHz band will be awarded. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the main auction to award the remaining 11 blocks of 10 MHz have been postponed. Their allocation is scheduled to be launched on September 29, 2020. The Group monitors the regulations to which it is subject; however, the weight of the regulatory burden on “electronic” telecommunications operators, including the Group, may change and may lead to the application of different obligations in their regard depending on the level of ownership of direct access networks and the level of market power that may be more or less significant to or constrictive upon certain operators by virtue of changes in the technology used for providing services. If the Group becomes subject to regulations relatively more constrictive than its competitors, this could have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations or financial position. Furthermore, as an “electronic” telecommunications operator and a distributor of television services, the Group is subject to special taxes. The burden of such taxes could increase in the future due to changes in legislation. In addition, the Group cannot guarantee that additional taxes will not be instituted in the telecommunications industry. Any future restrictions on the Group’s ability to market its products or services in the way it wishes could have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations or financial position.

    Title: The European Commission’s “Digital Single Market” legislation could adversely affect the Group’s businesses.
    Text: The EU Regulation 531/2012, which initially set a rate for roaming, was further amended through the regulation 2015/2120 of 25/11/2015 to establish the conditions and the viability of a removal of retail roaming charges from June 15, 2017 (“roam like at home” subject to fair-usage). Moreover, the regulation introduces measures relating to “net neutrality”. Furthermore, the roaming regulation was completed by other pieces of legislation: - Implementing regulation EU 2016/2286 of 15/12/2016 laying down detailed rules on the application of fair use policy and on the methodology for assessing the sustainability of the abolition of retail roaming surcharges and on the application to be submitted by a roaming provider for the purposes of that assessment; and - Regulation UE 2017/920 of 17/05/2017 amending Regulation (EU) No 531/2012 with respect to rules for wholesale roaming markets. The Commission’s proposals on telecommunications markets presented in September 2016 intends to fix rules to support the creation of Gigabit Society. The electronic communications code proposal aims to make investment in very high capacity networks a binding objective and it also aims to promote sustainable long term competition. It was adopted through Directive 2018/1972 of December 11, 2018 establishing the European Electronic Communications Code (the “EECC”), which entered into force on December 20, 2018. This legislation is expected to have both a positive and adverse effect on revenue generated from the Group’s operations due to anticipated price decreases, higher operational costs and increased competition. All of these factors may adversely affect the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations. The EECC brings together the rules on electronic communications networks and services and aligns them with the latest technological developments. The EECC regulates (i) electronic communications networks and services (“ECN” and “ECS”), (ii) associated facilities and services, (iii) the authorisation of networks and services, (iv) radio spectrum use and numbering resources, (v) access to and interconnection of electronic communications networks and associated facilities and (vi) the protection of end-users. It aims to: - Promote connectivity, access to and take-up of very high capacity networks by all citizens and businesses of the EU; - Promote competition in the provision of electronic communication networks and services; ----- - Contribute to the development of the internal market in the field of electronic communications networks and services, radio spectrum, and connectivity; and - Promote the interests of European citizens. The EECC has singled out citizen connectivity as a key objective for the EU, since it is instrumental in guaranteeing freedom of expression, pluralism, democracy, culture, social cohesion, and even safety. The EECC also adopts a broader definition of ECS to regulate services delivered via internet (known as “over-the-top” or “OTT” services). ECS now includes internet access services, interpersonal communications services (“ICS”), and services consisting wholly or mainly in the conveyance of signals. The EECC also provides for strategic planning and coordination of a radio spectrum policy, as well as for effective management of radio spectrum by Member States. Finally, national regulation authorities are responsible for ensuring access, interconnection, and the interoperability of services. Consequently, and under certain circumstances, they can impose on undertakings obligations such as interconnecting networks, ensuring the interoperability of their services and granting physical access to their infrastructure. A public concertation was initiated on December 2019 with regard to the transposition into French national law of the EECC. The concertation covers the following topics: - the maximum duration of the contracts between customers and service providers, - framing the conditions under which bundled offers (mobile phone and plan) can be offered to the customers, - the regulation of added value services, - the termination conditions (to ensure that termination provisions do not carry any deterrent effect), and - the conditions under which service providers who refuse to respect the provisions of the EECC (number portability, change of operator, etc.) can be sanctioned. Member States must enact the EECC into their national laws by December 21, 2020. As of the date hereof, France has not yet enacted EECC into its national laws.

    Title: The legal status of the Group’s network is complex and in certain cases subject to challenges or renewals.
    Text: The legal status of the Group’s network is complex and the network is mainly governed by public law, which could affect the predictability of the Group’s rights over its network. For a description of the legal status of the Group’s cable network see “Regulation—Legal Status of Networks”. The Group’s telecommunications network is essentially composed of the physical infrastructure (conduits, network head-ends, switches and radio frequency stations) in which telecommunications (mainly cable) equipment is installed. These components of the Group’s network are subject to different legal regimes. As the Group does not own certain land where such physical infrastructures are located and infrastructure is established on public or private property, it has entered into concessions, rights-of-way, leases or even IRUs with the owners of the land. In order to establish a substantial part of its telecommunications network and of its wireless network, the Group has thus entered into public and private property occupancy agreements with public and private entities or holds public property occupancy permits. Under these agreements or permits, the Group may install its network equipment along roads, highways, railways or canals, for example. No transfer of ownership takes place within this framework. Such agreements are entered into for terms that vary greatly, from 3 to 25 years. The Group does not have any right to renewal of such agreements, although the agreements with the shortest terms generally provide for tacit renewal. The Group’s occupancy of public property, as is the case for all occupants of public property, is always precarious and subject to considerations beyond the Group’s control. The public entities with which the Group has entered into these agreements or that have issued permits to it can thus at any time terminate these public property occupancy agreements for misconduct or for reasons of public interest and some of the agreements even exclude any compensation in such case. ----- If the Group fails to obtain such renewal, the company involved would be obliged, upon expiration of these agreements, (i) to return the site to its original condition upon the demand of the manager or owner of the public property involved and/or (ii) to transfer to the latter, in certain cases for the payment of compensation and in certain cases free of charge, ownership of the facilities established on the property involved. If the Group loses all or part of the rights relating to its network, it could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial position, results of operations or outlook of the Group.

    Title: The Group can only operate its business for as long as it has licenses from the relevant authorities and it may not be able to obtain, retain or review the licenses and authorizations necessary for conducting its activities.
    Text: The Group is required to hold licenses, franchises, permits and similar authorizations to own and operate the Group’s networks and to broadcast its signal to its customers. These authorizations generally require that we comply with applicable laws and regulations, meet certain solvency requirements and maintain minimum levels of service. Should the Group fail to comply with these, it may be subject to financial penalties from the relevant authorities and there may also be a risk that licenses could be partially or totally withdrawn. The imposition of fines and/or the withdrawal of licenses could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition and prevent us from conducting the Group’s business. In addition, such authorizations are generally granted for fixed terms and must be periodically renewed. The procedure for obtaining or renewing these licenses can be long and costly and authorities often demand concessions or other commitments as a condition for renewal. In addition, these licenses may not be obtainable or renewable in a timely manner or at all. In some instances, such authorizations have not been renewed at expiration, and we have operated and are operating under either temporary operating agreements or without an authorization while negotiating renewal terms with the local franchising authorities. Should we not be able to obtain or renew the licenses needed to operate or develop our business in a timely fashion, the Group’s ability to realize our strategic objectives may be compromised. In certain cases the Group’s mobile licenses require it to comply with certain obligations (population coverage, sharing in certain areas, national roaming) and the Group may suffer adverse consequences if is not able to comply with these obligations. In certain countries, we have provided significant bank guarantees to guarantee our performance under our licenses. If the Group is found to be in material breach of our licenses, the guarantees may be forfeited and our licenses may be revoked. Some of the Group’s activities depend on obtaining or renewing licences issued by regulatory authorities, particularly ARCEP in the telecommunications field and CSA in the audiovisual field. Under the licences allocated to the Group’s subsidiaries, the latter have committed themselves to complying with certain obligations (population coverage, sharing in some areas, roaming allowance). The Group is required to deploy a 3G and 4G generation radio network adhering to certain rates of coverage for the metropolitan population according to a given timetable. Within the framework of its 4G licences, if certain conditions are met, the Group will eventually have to allow Free Mobile roaming on a portion of its 4G network. The Group will also have to provide coverage, in conjunction with other 800 MHz band holders and under its 2G licence, for the city centers identified under the “white zones” plan, and accede to reasonable requests for network sharing in a priority deployment zone. The Group will also have to accede to reasonable requests to allow MVNOs throughout its very-high-speed mobile network open to the public in Metropolitan France. A failure to adhere to any one of these commitments could put the Group at risk under its regulatory obligations and possibly expose it to penalties (fines, total or partial suspension or withdrawal of licence). This could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial position, results of operations or outlook of the Group. To provide the Group’s various stakeholders with certainty over the future of some spectrum resources and with a view to issuing a call for applications that will enable a reallocation of longstanding 2G and 3G frequency bands for a period of 10 years (the licences relating to which will begin to expire in 2021), ARCEP has laid the ground rules for public consultation on the terms and conditions for such reallocation in its decision no. 2018-0684. The frequencies concerned are the frequencies in the 900 and 1800 MHz bands that were allocated to Orange, the Group and Bouygues Telecom in 2006 and 2009 for 15 years, and the 2.1 GHz band frequencies allocated to these same three operators in 2001 and 2002 for 20 years. Some of the existing 900, 1800 and 2100 MHz frequency licences for Metropolitan France are set to expire in 2021, 2022 and 2024. The terms for allocating frequencies seek to satisfy two main goals: digital regional development and achieving fair and effective competition between operators. The call for applications procedures for the allocation of 900, 1800 and 2100 MHz band frequencies took into account the goal of ensuring fair and effective competition in the mobile market by implementing the conditions needed to ensure that all mobile operators have fair and equal access to spectrum. It has been approved by the Minister responsible for electronic communications who launched the allocation procedure in early August 2018. The licences were awarded by ARCEP on November 15, 2018, and the frequencies will be made available starting in 2021. ----- The acquisition of licences also represents a high cost, the timing of which varies depending on when the frequencies involved are auctioned. Furthermore, this cost could rise due to strong competitive pressure in the telecommunications field. If we fail to obtain or retain, in a timely manner, the licences necessary for performing, continuing or developing our activities, the Group’s ability to achieve our strategic objectives could be subjected to alteration. In addition, the Group may fail to be awarded the desired licences, which could have an adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial position, results of operations or outlook. For further information on the licences and authorizations necessary for performance of the Group’s activities, see “Regulation”.

    Title: There are uncertainties about the legal framework under which we own and operate certain of our networks.
    Text: The Group’s systems depend on extensive physical facilities (lines, network, headends, switches and radio stations) in which telecommunication equipment (mainly cables) is installed. Significant portions of those physical facilities occupy public rights of way and are subject to governmental regulations. Other portions occupy private property under express or implied easements or pursuant to leases, and many miles of the cable are attached to utility poles governed by pole attachment agreements or other commercial arrangements. No assurances can be given that we will be able to maintain and use our facilities in their current locations and at their current costs. Changes in governmental regulations or changes in these relationships could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business and results of operations. In particular, the legal status of the Group’s network is complex, mainly governed by public and in certain cases subject to challenges or renewals. The Group’s telecommunications network is essentially composed of the physical infrastructure (conduits, network head-ends, switches and radio frequency stations) in which telecommunications (mainly cable) equipment is installed.

    Title: The Group is subject to requirements in terms of protection of personal data and data security.
    Text: Within the context of our business activities, we must collect and process personal data. In the EU, the European Parliament and the European Council adopted the regulation on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation, the “GDPR”) on April 27, 2016. The GDPR has been directly applicable in all EU member states since May 25, 2018, replacing Directive 95/46/EC and current national data protection legislation in member states, and was implemented in the EEA countries with effect from the same date. The GDPR significantly changes the EU/EEA data protection landscape, including strengthening of individuals’ rights, stricter requirements on companies processing personal data and stricter sanctions with substantial administrative fines. The GDPR also offers data subjects the option to let a privacy organization litigate on their behalf, including collecting the potential damages. After an initial transition period, data protection authorities across the EU have now begun using their new sanctioning powers (in 2019, Google was fined ----- €50 million by the French authority (CNIL), British Airways and Marriott were provisionally fined £183 million and £99 million, respectively by the UK authority (ICO), and many cases are currently under investigation). The Group does business in the hosting of data relating to the health of individuals, which subjects us to the specific obligations provided for by the Public Health Code such as obtaining and maintaining authorization or certification for the hosting of such data. If we breach our obligations or fail to adhere to the requirements applicable to sensitive data processing, the Group may be subjected to criminal and financial penalties likely to have a material adverse impact on our business, financial position and results of operations. In its judgment on October 6, 2015 (known as the “Schrems Judgment”), the European Court of Justice overturned the decision by the European Commission that the transfer of European personal data to the United States under the “Safe Harbor” framework provides an adequate level of protection. The successor “Privacy Shield” agreement negotiated by representatives of the EU and the United States have been overturned by a judgment of the European Court of Justice of July 16, 2020 (case C-311/18, known as “Schrems II”) which could impact our business and results. In 2016, the CJEU further clarified what safeguards are required for data retention to be lawful. In the case of Tele2 Sverige and Home Secretary v. Watson, the court concluded that Member States cannot impose a general obligation on providers of electronic telecommunications services to retain data, but did not ban data retention altogether. Such retention is compatible with EU law if deployed against specific targets to fight serious crime. Retention measures must be necessary and proportionate regarding the categories of data to be retained, the means of communication affected, the persons concerned and the chosen duration of retention. Furthermore, national authorities’ access to the retained data must be conditional and meet certain data protection safeguards. New data retention rules are currently being discussed at an EU level in response to this decision. In the case of Breyer, the CJEU concluded that Internet Protocol addresses may constitute personal data where the individual concerned can be identified, even where a third party must obtain additional data for the identification to take place. The CJEU also held that website operators may rely on a legitimate interest as a legal basis when retaining and using their visitors’ personal data. This is of major importance for data retention rules; it follows that online media service providers can lawfully store their visitors’ personal data to pursue a legitimate interest, rather than just for the purposes previously outlined in the invalidated Data Retention Directive. Thus, the grounds justifying data retention have become broader. The French legal framework for data protection has been gradually brought in line with the GDPR and the Police and Justice Directive. The French Data Protection Law of January 6, 1978 (Law no. 78-17), was amended by Law no. 2018-493 of June 20, 2018 and its implementing decree, and by decree no. 2018-687 of August 1, 2018. Such Law was rewritten and made consistent with GDPR by Order no. 2018-1225 of December 12, 2018. Finally, a new decree implementing the Law, no. 2019-536 of May 29, 2019 came into force on June 1, 2019. The French legal framework for data protection has now been stabilised. It imposes obligations on companies processing personal data in the context of the activities of an establishment in France concerning the conditions in which such a company may process personal data of individuals, the obtaining of their consent with respect to such processing (especially for the use of cookies) and carrying out the necessary measures for disclosure and transfer of data outside of the EU. Any breach of these obligations may lead to criminal and administrative financial penalties against us and damage to our reputation. On June 28, 2019, the French data protection authority (CNIL) announced new guidelines on the use of cookies for direct marketing purposes (online targeted advertisement), ruling out the use of implied or “soft” consent to place cookies on users’ devices. To assist companies in complying with these new rules, the CNIL published a draft recommendation on cookies on January 14, 2020 and the new legal regime applicable in France regarding cookies should be stabilised by the end of 2020. Regardless of the measures we adopt to protect the confidentiality, security of data and respect the rights of the people whose data we process, there remains the risk of possible attacks or breaches of data processing systems, which could give rise to penalties and damage our reputation. The Group could be compelled to incur additional costs in order to protect against these risks or to mitigate the consequences thereof, which could in turn have a material adverse impact on our business, financial position, results of operations or outlook. Furthermore, any loss of confidence on the part of our customers as a result of such events could lead to a significant decline in sales and have a material adverse impact on our business, financial position and results of operations. -----

Does the text mention that the company is exposed to risks associated with cyclical products?

    Title: The Group’s business may suffer if it cannot continue to license or enforce the intellectual property rights on which our business depends or if it is subject to claims of intellectual property infringement.
    Text: The Group relies primarily on copyright, trademark and trade secret laws and licenses and other agreements with our employees, customers, suppliers and other parties to establish and maintain our intellectual property rights in content, technology and products and services used to conduct our businesses. However, our intellectual property rights or those of our licensors could be challenged or invalidated, we could have difficulty protecting or obtaining such rights or the rights may not be sufficient to permit us to take advantage of business opportunities, which could result in costly redesign efforts, discontinuance of certain product and service offerings or other competitive harm. The Group has received, and may receive in the future, claims of infringement or misappropriation of other parties’ proprietary rights, particularly creative rights with respect to broadcasted programs. In addition to claims relating to broadcasts on channels which the Group owns, it may be subject to intellectual property infringement claims with respect to programs broadcast on the other channels, including foreign channels that it carries. Moreover, the telecommunications industry is characterized by a high concentration of intellectual property rights, which increases the risk of litigation resulting from our activities upon the grounds of prior rights of third parties. Therefore, the Group is particularly exposed to the risk of proceedings initiated by patent trolls. See “—The Group _may be subject to intellectual property infringement claims by “patent trolls”.”_ Any such claims may require the Group to initiate or defend protracted and costly litigation, regardless of the merits of these claims. Successful challenges to our rights to intellectual property or claims of infringement of a third party’s intellectual property could require the Group to enter into royalty or licensing agreements on unfavorable terms, incur substantial monetary liability or be temporarily or permanently prohibited from further use of the intellectual property in question. This could require the Group to change our business practices and limit the Group’s ability to provide our customers with the content that they expect. Even if we believe that the claims of intellectual property infringement are without merit, defending against the claims can be time consuming and costly and may divert management’s attention and resources away from our business. An inability on our part to effectively protect certain important elements of our intellectual property rights and of our technology could have a material adverse effect on our activities, financial position, results of operations or outlook.

    Title: The Group may be subject to intellectual property infringement claims by “patent trolls”.
    Text: The Group may be the target of so-called “patent trolls” (also referred to as “non-practicing entities”), which have as their core business the acquisition of patents and licences, without actively producing goods or providing services, and commonly litigate alleging that such patents or licences have been infringed. The Group cannot exclude the possibility of risk from contentious claims from patent trolls, which could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business activities, financial condition and results of operations.

    Title: The Group face risks arising from the outcome of various legal, administrative and regulatory proceedings.
    Text: In the ordinary course of business, we become party to litigation and other legal proceedings, including administrative and regulatory proceedings, and may be subjected to investigations and audits. Some of the proceedings against us may involve claims for considerable amounts and may require that our general management devote time to addressing such issues, to the detriment of managing the business. In addition, such proceedings may result in substantial damages and/or may impair our reputation, which may result in a decline in the demand for our services which could have a material adverse effect on our business. The outcome of these proceedings and claims could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, our results of operations or our cash flows during the years when such disputes are decided or the sums potentially involved in them are paid. The Group may also be exposed to proceedings that could involve our independent distributor partners, as well as other telecommunications operators which are so exposed. The Group is currently involved in number of disputes and proceedings referred to in “Business of the Group— _Legal Proceedings”. The costs that may result from these lawsuits are only accrued when it is more likely than_ not that a liability, resulting from past events, will be incurred and the amount of that liability can be quantified or estimated within a reasonable range. The amount of the provisions recorded in the Unaudited Financial Statements of the Group as of June 30, 2020 in respect of lawsuits amounted to €85 million in the aggregate, based on a case by case assessment of the risk level of each individual lawsuit, and events arising during the course of legal proceedings may require a reassessment of this risk. The Group’s assessment of risk is based both on the advice of legal counsel and on our estimate of the probable settlement amounts that are expected to be incurred, ----- if such a settlement would be agreed by both parties. Any increase in the frequency or size of such claims could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and cash flows and could have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations and financial position.

    Title: The Group is subject to risk or litigation in the event of defective software or a claim by a third party as to software ownership.
    Text: In contrast to more traditional licences of standard (so-called “proprietary”) software, users of open source software (“OSS”) are generally permitted by the licensor to access, copy, modify and distribute the underlying source code. Such broad rights (such as in the GNU General Public Licence) are usually subject to the requirement that users not place any additional restrictions on access to the source code in any onward distribution of the software, and that such onward licensing be on the original licence terms. OSS is commonly viewed as having two major risks. First, the OSS licence usually also covers onward distributions of derivative works (based on the original OSS), with the result that proprietary software integrated with the OSS becomes “infected” and the entire integrated software program (OSS and proprietary software components) is covered by the OSS licence. One notable result of this is that the publisher or distributor of the derivative work would have to make available the source code of the entire work, including the proprietary software portions. The second commonly viewed risk is that OSS software is usually licenced “as is” without any contractual warranties. As a result, the Group would bear the risks in the event of defects with any OSS that the Group utilizes in its products and services without necessarily having any contractual recourse. Further, if the Group integrates OSS into any of the software that it publishes or distributes, then the use by the Group of OSS could have an impact on the ownership of the intellectual property in such software, particularly in terms of exclusivity, as the refusal to disclose any modifications made could be characterized as an infringement of the OSS licence. Moreover, the Group cannot rule out any risk of a request for disclosure or the request by a third party to access the modifications of the source code performed on such software. This situation could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial position, results of operations or outlook.

    Title: The introduction into French law of a class action open to consumer protection associations could increase the exposure of the Group to material litigation.
    Text: As of October 1, 2014, French law allows consumers to join a class action brought by a consumer protection association in order to obtain compensation for property damage suffered by virtue of the activity of consumption. Considering the B2C activities of the Group, in the event of a challenge by consumers pertaining to the products or services offered by the Group, the Group could be faced, as could all operators in the industry, with possible class actions joining numerous customers desiring to obtain compensation for possible harm. Under such circumstance, if damages or prohibited practices are proven or even merely alleged the Group could face significant amounts in claims. Moreover, such actions could undermine the Group’s reputation.

    Title: The Group may have exposure to greater than expected tax liabilities resulting from tax disputes, tax audits, adverse decisions by tax authorities or changes in tax treaties, laws, regulations or the interpretations thereof.
    Text: The tax laws and regulations in France may be subject to change and there may be changes in the content as well as in the interpretation and enforcement of tax law. As a result, the Group may face increases in taxes payable if tax rates increase, or if tax laws and regulations are modified by the competent authorities in an adverse manner. In addition, the tax authorities in France periodically examine our activities. Any change in local or international tax rules, for example prompted by the implementation of the OECD’s recommendations on Base Erosion and Profits Shifting (a global initiative to improve the fairness and integrity of tax systems), or new challenges by tax authorities, may have an adverse effect on the Group’s tax positions and its financial results. Any changes may also affect the return on an investors’ investment in the Group and result in changes in personal tax rates and tax relief. The Group has structured its commercial and financial activities in compliance with various regulatory obligations to which it is subject, as well as in line with our commercial and financial objectives. Significant judgment is required in determining our tax positions, including, amongst others, corporate income tax and value added tax (“VAT”). In the ordinary course of business, there are transactions where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. To the extent that the laws and regulations of the various countries in which our companies are located or operate do not establish clear or definitive provisions, the tax treatment applied to our activities or our intra ----- group reorganizations is sometimes based on interpretations of the applicable tax regulations. The Group cannot guarantee that such interpretations will not be called into question by the competent tax administrations, which could have a material adverse effect on the financial position or results of our operations More generally, any breach of the tax regulations and laws of the countries in which our companies are located or operate could result in adjustments or the payment of late fees, fines or penalties. The French tax authorities have reassessed the application of VAT rates on certain multi-play offerings for fiscal years 2011 to 2016. The Group is disputing all of the proposed reassessments and has initiated appeals and dispute proceedings, which are at different stages for each of the years subject to reassessments. For more details, see “Business of the Group—Legal Proceedings— _Tax Audits”._ In addition, tax laws and regulations could change and could be subject to changes in their interpretation and in the application thereof. In particular, in the current macroeconomic environment, governmental authorities could decide to increase tax rates, to eliminate existing tax exemptions, to expand tax bases, or to introduce new taxes. As a result, we could undergo an increase in our tax burden if tax rates rise or if legislation or the interpretation thereof by the administration changes. In particular, the Group is exposed to the risk of a further increase in the VAT (and / or sectorial taxes such as turnover taxes on electronic communications operators) and might not be able to pass along such increase, in full or in part, through subscription prices, and this would then have a negative impact on overall revenue. Furthermore, any such increase in subscription prices would expose the Group to a risk of an increased churn rate from of its existing subscribers and could limit the recruitment of new subscribers. Any such occurrence could have a material impact on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

    Title: The future results of operations of the Group, French tax rules, tax audits or litigation and possible intra- group reorganizations could limit the ability of the Group to make use of its tax losses and could thus reduce its net cash position.
    Text: The Group has significant tax losses. The ability to effectively make use of such losses will depend on a combination of factors, including (i) the ability to earn tax profits and the degree of matching between the level of such profits realized and the level of the losses, (ii) the general limitation under French tax law pursuant to which the percentage of carry forward tax losses that can be used to offset the portion of taxable profit exceeding €1 million is limited to 50% as well as certain more specific restrictions on the use of certain categories of losses, (iii) the consequences of present or future tax disputes or audits and (iv) possible changes in applicable laws and regulations. The impact of these factors could increase the tax burden of the Group and thus have an adverse effect on its cash position, the effective tax rate, the financial position and the results of operations of the Group.

    Title: French tax rules could limit the ability of the Group to deduct interest for tax purposes, thus reducing the net cash position of the Group.
    Text: As a general rule, pursuant to Article 39,1-1° of the French Tax Code (Code général des impôts) (“FTC”), expenses incurred by a French company are deductible provided, among other conditions, that (i) they are incurred in its direct corporate interest and (ii) they correspond to actual and justified expenses. In this respect, French case law has developed the concept of “abnormal act of management”, according to which the expenses incurred by a French company in relation with transactions that are not aligned with its direct corporate interest are not tax deductible. Given the complex intragroup transactions within the Group, the risk that the French Tax Authorities might try to challenge the deductibility of interest expenses resulting from intragroup financings (e.g., interest expenses on an intragroup loan), considering that such transactions (i) are not performed in the direct corporate interest of the French company of the Group at the level of which these interest expenses are incurred or (ii) have not been set at arm’s length conditions, cannot be excluded. Under Article 39.1.3° of the FTC, the deduction of interest paid by a French company to lenders who are direct shareholders of such company but are not related parties to such company within the meaning of Article 39.12 of the FTC, is subject to the conditions that (i) the share capital of the borrowing company is fully paid-in and (ii) the interest rate on the corresponding loans does not exceed a rate equal to the annual average rate of floating rate loans granted by financial establishments for a minimum term of two years (1.32% with respect to fiscal years closed on December 31, 2019). By exception, pursuant to Article 212, I-(a) of the FTC, the deductibility of interest ----- paid on loans granted by a related party within the meaning of Article 39.12 of the FTC is deductible within the limit of the interest that would have resulted from the application of the maximum tax rate computed as per Article 39, 1-3° of the FTC, or, if higher, from the rate that the borrower could have obtained from independent financial establishments in similar conditions. Pursuant to Article 39.12 of the FTC, two entities will be regarded as related if (i) one of the entities holds directly or indirectly the majority of the other entity’s share capital or actually exercises the power of decision in that entity or (ii) both entities are placed under the conditions defined in (i) to the control of a same third entity. In both of the above mentioned cases of interest and deductibility limitation, non-deductible expenses might be recharacterized as constructive dividends pursuant to Article 109 et seq. of the FTC, which may be subject to the withholding tax set out under Article 119 bis, 2 of the FTC, at a rate of (i) 28% (such rate will be lowered to 26,5% for fiscal years beginning as from January 1, 2021 and to 25% for fiscal years beginning as from January 1, 2022 in order to be aligned on the French standard corporate income tax rate) for payments benefiting legal persons who are not French tax residents or (ii) 75% for payments made in non-cooperative jurisdictions within the meaning of Article 238-0 A of the FTC other than those mentioned in 2° of 2 bis of the same Article 238-0 A, subject in any case to the more favorable provisions of an applicable double tax treaty. The French Finance Law for 2020 introduced new Articles 205 B, 205 C and 205 D in the FTC in order to implement under French tax law the provisions of the Council Directive (EU) 2017/952 of May 29, 2017 (the “ATAD 2”) on hybrid mismatches. These new rules aim at challenging hybrid and residency mismatches (the “Hybrid Mismatch Rules”) and replace the former anti-hybrid limitation that was set out by Article 212 I, b) of the FTC (pursuant to which the deductibility of interest paid on loans granted by a related party – within the meaning of Article 39.12 of the FTC – was subject to the requirement that the lender was, for the current year and with respect to concerned interest, subject to an income tax in an amount which was at least equal to 25% of the corporate income tax determined under standard French tax rules). Most of the Hybrid Mismatch Rules apply as from fiscal years starting on or after January 1, 2020 (consequently, Article 212 I-b of the FTC has been repealed from January 1, 2020). In substance, hybrid mismatches may result from the difference in the CIT tax treatment of (i) financial instruments, (ii) entities or (iii) payment attribution rules between two countries. Such differences may result in either: i A deduction for tax purposes in one country (the payer’s jurisdiction) without corresponding inclusion in the other (the payee’s jurisdiction); or ii A deduction in both countries (i.e., in the jurisdiction in which the payment has its source and in the investor’s jurisdiction). The new Hybrid Mismatch Rules provide for neutralization mechanisms of these mismatches which broadly lead to either (i) a non-deduction of payments or (ii) an inclusion in the taxable income of these payments. In practice, the Hybrid Mismatch Rules may concern any type of expenditure (including financial expenses) but shall only apply if a mismatch outcome arises either (i) between associated enterprises or (ii) under a structured arrangement (i.e., an arrangement involving a hybrid mismatch where the mismatch outcome is priced into the terms of the arrangement or an arrangement that has been designed to produce a hybrid mismatch outcome). For the purposes of these rules, an associated enterprise is different from a related party within the meaning of Article 39.12 of the FTC and means: - an entity in which the taxpayer (i) holds directly or indirectly a participation in terms of voting rights or capital ownership of 50% or more or (ii) is entitled to receive 50% or more of the profits of that entity; - a person which (i) holds directly or indirectly a participation in terms of voting rights or capital ownership in a taxpayer of 50% or more or (ii) is entitled to receive 50% or more of the profits of the taxpayer; - a taxpayer in which a person, who holds directly or indirectly a participation of 50% or more of the taxpayer’s voting rights or capital, also holds an interest of 50% or more of the voting rights or capital; ----- - an entity that is part of the same consolidated group for financial accounting purposes as the taxpayer; An enterprise in which the taxpayer has a significant influence in the management or an enterprise that has a significant influence in the management of the taxpayer. Pursuant to Article 212 bis of the FTC, subject to certain exceptions and safeharbour clauses, net financial charges, which are defined as the portion of financial charges exceeding financial income, accrued by companies that are subject to French corporate income tax, without distinction between third-party debts and related-party debts are deductible from their taxable result only up to a maximum amount equal to the higher of: (i) €3 million (to be adjusted on a _prorata temporis basis for fiscal years which do no last twelve months) and (ii) 30% of the company’s result before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization adjusted for tax purposes (“Tax EBITDA”) generated in the same fiscal year (the “30% EBITDA Limitation”). By exception, subject to certain exceptions and safeharbour clauses, where the average amount of the relatedparty debts of a company within the meaning of Article 39.12 of the FTC during a fiscal year exceeds in respect of that fiscal year one and a half times the amount of its equity (fonds propres), net financial expenses borne by such company are deductible for a portion of their amount up to the higher of (i) 30% of its Tax EBITDA and (ii) €3 million multiplied by a ratio equal to (A) the average amount of non-related party debts increased by 1.5x the company’s equity (assessed either at the beginning or at the closing date of the fiscal year) divided by (B) the average amount of all sums borrowed by or made available to the company during said year. The balance of net financial expenses is deductible for a portion of their amount up to the highest of (i) 10% of its Tax EBITDA and (ii) €1 million multiplied by a ratio equal to (A) the average amount of related-party debt exceeding 1.5x the company’s equity (assessed either at the beginning or at the closing date of the fiscal year) divided by (B) the average amount of all sums borrowed by or made available to the company during said fiscal year Under Article 223 B bis of the FTC, the above mentioned limitations apply, mutatis mutandis, to companies that belong to French tax-consolidated groups with respect to amounts made available by lenders outside such group. Finally, pursuant to Article 223 B of the FTC (generally referred to as the “Amendement Charasse”), when the shares of a target company are purchased from a seller by a company controlled directly or indirectly by such seller (or placed under common control with the seller), and the target company and the acquiring company become members of the same French tax-consolidated group, a portion of the interest incurred by the French taxconsolidated group in respect of a fiscal year is considered as non-deductible and is therefore added back to the tax-consolidated income. This add-back of financial costs is applicable over a maximum period of nine fiscal years (including the acquisition’s fiscal year) unless the target company leaves the French tax consolidated group (other than as a result of a merger with a company of the tax group to which the acquiring company belongs). If the limitation applies, the amount to be added back for each fiscal year is computed as follows: Purchase price of the shares Non-deductible interest Interest expenses deducted from the tax = x expenses group’s taxable income Average amount of the tax group’s debts The above mentioned tax rules may limit the Group’s ability to deduct interest accrued on the Group’s indebtedness incurred in France and, as a consequence, may increase the Group’s tax burden, which could adversely affect the Group’s business, results of operations and financial condition and reduce the cash flow available to service the Group’s indebtedness.

    Title: The Group’s employees may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, which could harm its business.
    Text: Given the size of the Group, it is likely to be exposed to instances of employee fraud, including, but not limited to, payroll fraud, falsification of expense claims, thefts of cash, assets or intellectual property, false accounting and other misconduct. Individual employees may also act against the Group’s instructions and either inadvertently or deliberately violate applicable law, including competition laws and regulations, by engaging in prohibited activities such as price fixing or colluding with competitors regarding markets or clients, or the Group’s internal ----- policies. In addition, because the Group delegates a number of operational responsibilities to its subsidiaries and the Group’s local managers retain autonomy regarding the management of the Group’s operations in their markets, it may face an increased likelihood of the risks described above occurring. The Group also subcontracts, through ACS, ATS and certain other Group entities, certain of the Group’s maintenance, customer service, installation and other activities to third party suppliers acting on the Group’s behalf and instances of fraud perpetuated by employees of these suppliers might also expose us to claims and/or may have a detrimental impact on the Group’s brand and reputation. In addition, because we delegate a number of operational responsibilities to the Group’s subsidiaries and the Group’s local managers retain substantial autonomy regarding the management of the Group’s operations in their markets, it may face an increased likelihood of the risks described above occurring.

    Title: The Group’s relations with its employees could be affected by changes in the competitive landscape.
    Text: The Group operate in highly competitive and changing markets, which requires us to constantly adapt, anticipate and adopt new measures in order to preserve our competitiveness and efficiency. This leads to regular changes in the Group’s organizational structure and operations, which requires the Group’s employees to be flexible in responding to such changes. This process requires mobilization and motivation of teams with the Group’s objectives. As a result, the Group’s business could be affected by deterioration in labor relations with its employees, staff representative bodies or unions. The Group’s ability to maintain good relations with our employees, staff representative bodies and unions is crucial to the success of our various projects. Therefore, we must continuously consult with staff representatives in order to ensure the success of our current and future projects, which may delay the completion of certain projects. Furthermore, projects may be poorly received by employees and lead to a deterioration in labor relations, which could, in turn, lead to declines in productivity and possible labor disputes (e.g., strikes, disruptions), which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, planned decisions may not be well received by employees and may lead to a deterioration of the social climate, causing decreases in productivity and potential social conflicts (work interruptions, disruptions, etc.). Such situations could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial situation and operational results of the Group.

    Title: The loss of certain key executives and personnel, failure to apply the necessary managerial and operational resources to our growing business or failure to sustain a good working relationship with employee representatives, including workers’ unions, could harm our business.
    Text: The Group depends on the continued contributions of our senior management and other key personnel and, in particular, Patrick Drahi, who is the President of the Board at Altice Europe and our principal shareholder. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in retaining their services or that we would be successful in hiring and training suitable replacements without undue costs or delays. As a result, the loss of the support of our founder and controlling shareholder (including the allocation of his time to any other business interests) or any of these key executives and employees could cause disruptions in our business operations, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any failure to apply the necessary managerial and operational resources to our growing business and any weaknesses in our operational and financial systems or managerial controls and procedures may impact the Group’s ability to produce reliable financial statements and may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In our business, we rely on sales forces and call center employees to interface with the major part of our customers. Their reliability is key, as is our relationship with employee representatives. Some of our employees currently belong to organized unions and works councils, and there can be no assurance that more employees will not form or join unions in the future. An increase in the number of our unionized employees could lead to an increased likelihood of strikes, work stoppages and other industrial actions. In addition, we also face the risk of strikes called by employees of our key suppliers of materials or services as well as our installation providers, which could result in interruptions in the performance of our services. The Group cannot predict the extent to which future labor disputes or disturbance could disrupt our operations, cause reputational or financial harm or make it more difficult to operate our businesses.

    Title: The interests of the Issuer’s controlling shareholders may differ from the interests of the holders of the Notes.
    Text: The interests of the controlling shareholders of the Issuer, in certain circumstances, may conflict with your interests as holders of the Notes. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, Next Alt is the controlling ----- shareholder of Altice Europe, and Altice Europe (through its indirect subsidiaries) owns 100% share capital and voting rights in the Issuer. In the event of consummation of the Take-Private Transaction, Next Alt will be the sole shareholder of Altice Europe and consequently Altice Europe would no longer have public investors as minority shareholders. When business opportunities, or risks and risk allocation arise, the interests of Altice Europe (or its affiliates) or Next Alt may be different from, or in conflict with, the Group’s interests on a standalone basis. Altice Europe and Next Alt may allocate certain of their risks to the Issuer or the Group and the Issuer cannot assure you that Altice Europe or Next Alt will permit the Group to pursue certain business opportunities. As a result of its controlling position, Altice Europe or Next Alt has, directly or indirectly, the power, among other things, to affect the Group’s legal and capital structure and day-to-day operations, as well as the ability to elect and change the Group’s management and to approve any other changes to the Group’s strategy, structure and operations. A change of strategy or management adversely affecting the Group’s operations could indirectly have an adverse effect on the Issuer’s abilities to meet its obligations under the Notes. In addition, Altice Europe or Next Alt has, directly or indirectly, the power to control the Group’s ability to enter into any corporate transaction and prevent any transaction that requires the approval of shareholders, regardless of whether holders of the Notes believe that any such transactions are in their own best interests. For example, Altice Europe or Next Alt could exercise such power to cause us to incur additional indebtedness or sell certain material assets, in each case, so long as the Group’s debt instruments and the Intercreditor Agreement permit. The incurrence of additional indebtedness would increase the Group’s debt service obligations and the sale of certain assets could reduce the Group’s ability to generate revenues, each of which could adversely affect the holders of the Notes. Furthermore, Altice Europe and its other subsidiaries also have substantial indebtedness. To the extent permitted by the Indenture and other agreements governing the indebtedness of the Group, the Board of Directors of the Issuer may (in compliance with their fiduciary duties as directors of a public company), in addition to the proceeds of the Notes which will be upstreamed by the Issuer to shareholders and used by a subsidiary of Altice Europe to (and an indirect shareholder of Altice France Holding and the Issuer) to repay certain of its indebtedness, vote to distribute cash to its shareholders to allow them to service and repay such indebtedness, including certain senior debt incurred by Altice France Holding.

    Title: Possible labor conflicts could disrupt our activities, affect our image or make the operation of our facilities more costly.
    Text: In the year ended December 31, 2019, we had on average approximately 32,500 employees, some of whom are union members. The Group may have to negotiate at length with unions and works councils, and may suffer strikes, labor conflicts, work stoppages and other labor action, and it may also encounter difficulties in attracting and keeping staff due to local or general strikes. Strikes and other labor action, as well as the negotiating of new collective bargaining agreements or wage negotiations, could disrupt our activities and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations. The Group is active in very competitive markets that are constantly evolving, thus requiring its constant adaptation to, anticipation and adoption of new operational practices and technologies to preserve its competitiveness and our efficiency. This entails regular changes in organizations, which requires adaptation on the part of the human resources involved. In particular, this process demands an ability to mobilize skills and motivate and orient teams toward our objectives. As a result, the Group’s activities may sometimes be affected by a deterioration of the labor relations with our employees, staff representative bodies or labor unions. In such instances, certain of the Group’s entities would have to consult their staff representative bodies, or will have to do so, in order to successfully execute the Group’s current and future projects, which is likely to slow down the performance of certain operations. The Group also faces the risk of strikes called by employees of our main suppliers of equipment or services, as well as our facility providers, the latter generally organized in regional unions, which could lead to interruptions in our services. The Group cannot guarantee that labor conflicts or difficulties in retaining our staff will not have a material adverse effect our business and, potentially, our results of operations and our financial position. The Group has undertaken a simplification of its organization and implemented certain operating synergies measures. This transformation plan involves numerous situations of internal mobility, which may result in employee dissatisfaction or loss of personnel. In addition, the Group has optimized its workforce and executed a voluntary retirement plan taken up by a significant number of employees. There can be no assurance that these measures will generate the expected efficiencies or benefits. As a result of these initiatives, there can be no guarantee that the Group will not experience employee dissatisfaction or personnel loss in the future. -----

    Title: The Issuer and certain Guarantors are holding companies and conduct no business of their own and will depend on payments from their direct and indirect subsidiaries to provide them with funds to meet their obligations under the Notes and Notes Guarantees.
    Text: The Issuer and certain of the Guarantors are holding companies with no business or revenue generating operations of their own. The only significant assets of the Issuer on the Issue Date will consist of cash in its bank accounts and its shares in its direct subsidiaries and various intercompany loans to its subsidiaries. As such, the Issuer will be wholly dependent upon payments under such loans and other payments from members of the Group in order to service its debt obligations under the Notes to the extent it does not have cash to meet those obligations. The ability of members of the Group to make such payments will depend upon their cash flows and earnings which, in turn, will be affected by all of the factors discussed in these “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. Furthermore, the payment of dividends and the making, or repayment, of loans and advances to the Issuer by the Issuer’s subsidiaries are subject to various restrictions. The ability of any of the Issuer’s direct or indirect subsidiaries to make certain distributions may be limited by the laws of the relevant jurisdiction in which the subsidiaries are organized or located, including financial assistance rules, corporate benefit laws, requirements that dividends must be paid out of reserves available for distribution and other legal restrictions which, if violated, might require the recipient to refund unlawful payments. In some cases, receipt of such payments or advances may be subject to onerous tax consequences. Although the Indenture, the Existing Senior Secured Indentures, the Existing Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement and the Existing Term Loans Agreement limit the ability of the Issuer’s subsidiaries to enter into future consensual restrictions on their ability to pay dividends and make other payments to the Issuer or the Guarantors, there are significant qualifications and exceptions to these limitations. We cannot assure you that arrangements with the Issuer’s subsidiaries and the funding permitted by the agreements governing existing and future indebtedness of the Issuer’s subsidiaries will provide the Guarantors or the Issuer with sufficient dividends, distributions or loans to fund payments under their Notes Guarantees or the Notes when due. See “Description of _Other Indebtedness” and “Description of Notes”._

Does the text mention that the company is exposed to risks associated with cyclical products?

    Title: Your right to receive payments under the Notes may be structurally or effectively subordinated to the claims of certain existing and future creditors of the Issuer’s subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes.
    Text: On the Issue Date, the Notes will be guaranteed on a senior secured basis by the Guarantors. Generally, claims of creditors of a non-Guarantor subsidiary, including trade creditors and claims of preference shareholders (if any) of the subsidiary, will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of the subsidiary over the claims of creditors of its parent entity, including claims by holders of the Notes under the Notes Guarantees. In the event of any foreclosure, dissolution, winding up, liquidation, administration, reorganization or other insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding of any of the Group’s non-Guarantor subsidiaries, holders of their debt (including any intercompany loan to such subsidiaries) and their trade creditors will generally be entitled to payment of their claims from the assets of those subsidiaries before any assets are made available for distribution to its parent entity. As such, the Notes and the Notes Guarantees, will be structurally subordinated to the creditors (including trade creditors) and preference shareholders (if any) of the Group’s non-Guarantor subsidiaries. The Group’s non-Guarantor subsidiaries may also be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, further increasing the risks associated with leverage. If any of the Group’s non-Guarantor subsidiaries incurs additional indebtedness, the holders of that debt will be entitled to share ahead of you in any proceeds distributed in connection with any insolvency, liquidation, reorganization, dissolution or other winding up of such nonGuarantor subsidiaries.

    Title: The value of the Notes Collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy the Issuer’s obligations under its Notes and the obligations of the Guarantors under the Notes Guarantees and such Notes Collateral may be reduced or diluted under certain circumstances.
    Text: In the event of liquidation, insolvency, foreclosure, bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceeding, the proceeds from the sale of the Notes Collateral that secures the Notes and the Notes Guarantees may not be sufficient to satisfy the Issuer’s obligations under the Notes and the obligations of the Guarantors under the Notes Guarantees. The value of the Notes Collateral and the amount that may be received upon a sale of Notes Collateral will depend upon many factors including, among others, the condition of the Notes Collateral, the ability to sell the Notes ----- Collateral in an orderly sale, industry, market and economic conditions, whether the business is sold as a going concern, the availability of buyers and other factors. With respect to any shares of the Group’s subsidiaries pledged to secure the Notes and the Notes Guarantees, such shares may also have limited value in the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation, winding up or other similar proceedings in relation to the entity’s shares that have been pledged because all of the obligations of the entity whose shares have been pledged must first be satisfied, leaving little or no remaining assets in the pledged entity. As a result, the creditors secured by a pledge of the shares of these entities may not recover anything of value in the case of an enforcement sale. In addition, courts could limit recoverability with respect to the Notes Collateral if they deem a portion of the interest claim usurious in violation of applicable public policy. As a result, liquidating the Notes Collateral may not produce proceeds in an amount sufficient to pay any amounts due on the Notes. If the proceeds of Notes Collateral were not sufficient to repay amounts outstanding under the Notes, then holders of the Notes (to the extent not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the Notes Collateral) would only have an unsecured claim against the Issuer’s and Guarantors’ remaining assets. See “—It may be difficult to realize the value of the Notes Collateral securing the Notes.” No appraisal of the fair market value of the Notes Collateral has been made in connection with this offering of Notes. The book value of the Notes Collateral should not be relied on as a measure of realizable value for such assets. The value of the Notes Collateral could be impaired in the future as a result of changing economic and market conditions, the Group’s failure to successfully implement the Group’s business strategy, competition and other factors. The Notes Collateral may include intangible or other illiquid assets that by their nature may not have a readily ascertainable market value, whose value to other parties may be less than its value to the Group, or may not be readily saleable or, if saleable, there may be substantial delays in their liquidation. In addition, the value of the Notes Collateral may decrease because of obsolescence, impairment or certain casualty events. The Indenture, the Existing Senior Secured Indentures, the Existing Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement and the Existing Term Loans Agreement permit the granting of certain liens other than those in favor of the holders of the Notes on the Notes Collateral securing the Notes. To the extent that holders of other secured indebtedness or third parties enjoy such liens, including statutory liens, whether or not permitted by the Indenture, the Existing Senior Secured Indentures, the Existing Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement and the Existing Term Loans Agreement or the Notes Collateral Documents, such holders or third parties may have rights and remedies with respect to the Notes Collateral that, if exercised, could reduce the proceeds available to satisfy the Issuer’s obligations under the Notes and the obligations of the Guarantors under the Notes Guarantees, to the extent such Notes and Notes Guarantees are secured by such Notes Collateral. Moreover, if the Issuer issues additional Notes under the Indenture, holders of such additional Notes would benefit from the same Notes Collateral as the holders of the Notes being offered hereby, thereby diluting holders of Notes’ ability to benefit from the liens on the Notes Collateral securing their Notes. The Intercreditor Agreement provides for detailed enforcement mechanisms with respect to the Notes Collateral and any enforcement of the Notes Collateral will be subject in many cases to significant limitations under local law. Please see “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement” and “Limitation on Validity and _Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests and Insolvency Laws of Certain Jurisdictions— France—Limitation on Enforcement of Security Interests.”_

    Title: It may be difficult to realize the value of the Notes Collateral securing the Notes.
    Text: The Notes Collateral will be subject to any and all exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens, loss of legal perfection and other imperfections permitted under the Indenture and/or the Intercreditor Agreement. The Initial Purchasers have neither analyzed the effect of, nor participated in any negotiations relating to, such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections. The existence of any such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens, loss of legal perfection and other imperfections could adversely affect the value of the Notes Collateral, as well as the ability of the Security Agent to realize or foreclose on such Notes Collateral. Furthermore, the ranking of security interests can be affected by a variety of factors, including, among others, the timely satisfaction of perfection requirements, statutory liens or recharacterization under the laws of certain jurisdictions. The security interests of the Security Agent will be subject to practical problems generally associated with the realization of security interests over real or personal property such as the Notes Collateral. For example, the Security Agent may need to obtain the consent of a third party, including that of competent regulatory authorities or courts, to enforce a security interest. The Group cannot assure you that the Security Agent will be able to obtain any such consents. The Group also cannot assure you that the consents of any third parties will be given when required to facilitate a foreclosure on such assets. Accordingly, the Security Agent may not have the ability to foreclose upon those assets, and the value of the Notes Collateral may significantly decrease. ----- Furthermore, enforcement procedures and timing for obtaining judicial decisions in Luxembourg may be materially more complex and time consuming than in equivalent situations in jurisdictions with which investors may be more familiar. In addition, the Group’s business requires a variety of national and local permits and licenses. The continued operation of properties that comprise part of the Notes Collateral and that depend on the maintenance of such permits and licenses may be prohibited or restricted. The Group’s business is subject to regulations and permitting requirements and may be adversely affected if we are unable to comply with existing regulations or requirements or if changes in applicable regulations or requirements occur. In the event of foreclosure, the grant of permits and licenses may be revoked and the transfer of such permits and licenses may be prohibited or may require us to incur significant cost and expense. Furthermore, we cannot assure you that the applicable governmental authorities will consent to the transfer of all such permits. If the regulatory approvals required for such transfers are not obtained, are delayed or are economically prevented, the foreclosure may be delayed, a temporary or lasting shutdown of operations may result, and the value of the Notes Collateral may be significantly decreased.

Does the text mention that the company is exposed to risks associated with cyclical products?

    Title: Rights in the Notes Collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect security interests in the Notes Collateral.
    Text: Applicable law may require that a security interest in certain assets can only be properly perfected and its priority retained through certain actions undertaken by the secured party or the grantor of the security. The liens on the Notes Collateral may not be perfected with respect to the Notes and the Notes Guarantees, as the case may be, if the Security Agent is not able to or does not take the actions necessary to perfect or maintain the perfection of any such liens. Such failure may result in the invalidity of the relevant security interest in the Notes Collateral securing the Notes or the Notes Guarantees, as applicable, or adversely affect the priority of such security interest in favor of such debt against third parties, including a trustee in bankruptcy and other creditors who claim a security interest in the same Notes Collateral. In addition, applicable law may require that certain property and rights acquired after the grant of a general security interest can only be perfected at the time such property and rights are acquired and identified. There can be no assurance that the Security Agent will monitor, or that we will inform the Security Agent of, the future acquisition of property and rights that constitute Notes Collateral, and that all necessary action will be taken to properly perfect the security interest in such after acquired collateral. Neither the Security Agent nor the Trustee has any obligation to monitor the acquisition of additional property or rights that should constitute Notes Collateral or the perfection of, or to take steps to perfect, any security interest therein. Such failure may result in the loss of the security interest in the Notes Collateral or adversely affect the priority of the security interest in favor of the Notes and the Notes Guarantees against third parties including a trustee in bankruptcy and other creditors who may claim a secured interest in any part of the Notes Collateral. Additionally, the Indenture and the Notes Collateral Documents may require the Group to take a number of actions that might improve the perfection or priority of the liens of the Security Agent in the Notes Collateral. To the extent that the security interests created by the Notes Collateral Documents with respect to any Notes Collateral are not perfected, the Security Agent’s rights will be equal to the rights of general unsecured creditors in the event of a liquidation, foreclosure, bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceeding.

    Title: There are circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the Notes under which the Notes Guarantees and the Notes Collateral will be released automatically, without your consent or the consent of the Trustee.
    Text: Under various circumstances, the Notes Guarantees will be released. See “Description of Notes—The Notes _Guarantees—Releases of the Notes Guarantees”. In addition, under various circumstances, the Issuer and the_ Guarantors will be entitled to release the security interests in respect of the Notes Collateral securing the Notes and the Notes Guarantees. The Group will also be permitted to release and/or re-take any lien on any Notes Collateral to the extent otherwise permitted by the terms of the Indenture, the Notes Collateral Documents, the Existing Senior Secured Indentures and/or the Intercreditor Agreement or any additional intercreditor agreement. Such a release and re-taking of Notes Collateral may give rise to the start of a new hardening period in respect of the Notes Collateral and/or the Notes Collateral may be void under applicable law. Under certain circumstances, other creditors, insolvency administrators or representatives or courts could challenge the validity or enforceability of the grant of the Notes Collateral. Any such challenge, if successful, could potentially limit your recovery in respect of the Notes Collateral and thus reduce your recovery under the Notes. See “Description of Notes—Notes Security”. ----- The Indenture permits us to designate one or more of our restricted subsidiaries as an unrestricted subsidiary. If we designate any other restricted subsidiary as an unrestricted subsidiary for purposes of the Indenture, all of the liens on any Notes Collateral owned by such subsidiary or any of its subsidiaries (if any) and any guarantees of the Notes by such subsidiary (if any) or any of its subsidiaries will be released under the Indenture. The designation of an unrestricted subsidiary will reduce the aggregate value of the Notes Collateral securing the Notes to the extent that liens on the assets of the unrestricted subsidiary and its subsidiaries are released. In addition, the creditors of the unrestricted subsidiary and its subsidiaries will have a senior claim on the assets of such unrestricted subsidiary and its subsidiaries.

    Title: Some of our present and future subsidiaries and associates, including SFR FTTH and SportCoTV and their respective present and future subsidiaries, will constitute Unrestricted Subsidiaries under the Indenture governing the Notes, and will, therefore, not be subject to the restrictive covenants thereunder and may incur additional indebtedness without limitation in the future.
    Text: SFR FTTH, an associate in which the Group owns 50.01% interest (with the remaining held by the JV Consortium), and SportCoTV, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Issuer of which financial condition and results of operations will be fully consolidated to the Group’s financial statements, and their respective subsidiaries, will be designated as Unrestricted Subsidiaries on the Issue Date under the Existing Senior Secured Indentures and the Indenture. Any of their future subsidiaries will also be Unrestricted Subsidiaries under the Existing Senior Secured Indentures and the Indenture. So long as such subsidiaries or associates, as the case may be, remain as Unrestricted Subsidiaries, they will not guarantee the Notes and the restrictive covenants under the Indenture (or those under the Existing Senior Secured Indentures) will not apply to such subsidiaries or associates. Accordingly, Unrestricted Subsidiaries may, among other things, incur unlimited debt (including debt that is secured on the assets of such Unrestricted Subsidiaries and the Group’s equity interests in such Unrestricted Subsidiaries), pay unlimited dividends or make other distributions to their shareholders or to third parties and sell their assets without any restriction on the consideration received or the use of proceeds therefrom. If any of the Unrestricted Subsidiaries were to default on any additional debt they may incur, such subsidiary or associate, as the case may be, may require funding from the Issuer or any of its subsidiaries or could face the risk of becoming insolvent, which would in turn have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. In addition, while the relationship between the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries on the one hand and the Unrestricted Subsidiaries on the other hand will be subject to the covenants under the Indenture, there are a number of exceptions and qualifications to these restrictions. For more information, see “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions”, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial _Condition and Results of Operations – Post-Balance Sheet Date Events” and “Description of Notes”._

    Title: The Group will in most cases have control over the Notes Collateral securing the Notes and the sale or disposal of particular assets could reduce the pool of assets securing such debt.
    Text: The Notes Collateral Documents will allow the Issuer and the Guarantors, as applicable, to remain in possession of, retain exclusive control over, freely operate, and collect, invest and dispose of any income from the Notes Collateral. So long as no default or event of default under the Indenture would result therefrom, the Issuer and the Guarantors may, among other things, without any release or consent by the Security Agent, conduct ordinary course activities with respect to the Notes Collateral, such as selling, factoring, abandoning or otherwise disposing of Notes Collateral and making ordinary course cash payments, including repayments of debt. Any of these activities could reduce the value of the Notes Collateral and consequently the amounts payable to you from proceeds of any sale of Notes Collateral in the case of an enforcement of the liens.

    Title: The security interests in the Notes Collateral will be granted to the Security Agent rather than directly to the holders of Notes. The ability of the Security Agent to enforce certain of the Notes Collateral may be restricted by local law.
    Text: The security interests in the Notes Collateral will not be granted directly to the holders of Notes, but will be granted only in favor of the Security Agent. The Indenture will provide (along with the Intercreditor Agreement) that only the Security Agent has the right to enforce the respective security documents. As a consequence, holders of the Notes will not have direct security interests and will not be entitled to take enforcement action in respect of the Notes, except through the Trustee, who will (subject to the provisions of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement) provide instructions to the Security Agent in respect of the Notes Collateral. The ability of the Trustee to control enforcement of any such collateral is subject to significant limitations. See “Description of Other _Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement”._ ----- The appointment of a foreign security agent will be recognized under Luxembourg law, (i) to the extent that the designation is valid under the law governing such appointment and (ii) subject to possible restrictions, depending on the type of the security interests. Generally, according to article 2(4) of the Luxembourg Act dated August 5, 2005 concerning financial collateral arrangements, as amended, a security (financial collateral) may be provided in favor of a person acting on behalf of the collateral taker, a fiduciary or a trustee in order to secure the claims of third party beneficiaries, whether present or future, provided that these third party beneficiaries are determined or may be determined. Without prejudice to their obligations vis à vis third party beneficiaries of the security, persons acting on behalf of beneficiaries of the security, the fiduciary or the trustee benefit from the same rights as those of the direct beneficiaries of the security aimed at by such law. The respective security documents governing the Notes Collateral will be governed by the laws of a number of jurisdictions. Bankruptcy laws could prevent the Security Agent on behalf of the holders of the Notes from repossessing and disposing of the Notes Collateral upon the occurrence of an event of default if a bankruptcy proceeding is commenced by or against the relevant grantor, before the Security Agent repossesses and disposes of such Notes Collateral to the extent applicable. See “—Enforcing your rights as a holder of the Notes or under _the Notes Guarantees or any future guarantees, if any, or security across multiple jurisdictions may prove difficult or provide less protection than U.S. bankruptcy law.”_

    Title: The granting of the security interests in connection with the issuance of the Notes, or the incurrence of permitted debt in the future, may create or restart hardening or voidance periods for such security interests in accordance with the laws applicable in certain jurisdictions.
    Text: The granting of the security interests to secure the Notes may create hardening or voidance periods for such security interests in certain jurisdictions. The granting of shared security interests to secure future permitted debt may restart or reopen such hardening or voidance periods in particular, because the Indenture will permit the release and retaking of security granted in favor of the Notes in certain circumstances, including in connection with the incurrence of future debt. The applicable hardening or voidance period for these new security interests can run from the moment each new security interest has been granted or perfected. At each such time, if the security interest granted or recreated were to be enforced before the end of the respective hardening or voidance period applicable in such jurisdiction, it may be declared void or ineffective and/or it may not be possible to enforce it.

    Title: Enforcing your rights as a holder of the Notes or under the Notes Guarantees or any future guarantees, if any, or security across multiple jurisdictions may prove difficult or provide less protection than U.S. bankruptcy law.
    Text: The Notes will be issued by the Issuer, which is incorporated under the laws of France. The Notes will be guaranteed as from the Issue Date by the Guarantors, which are incorporated under the laws of France, Luxembourg and the United States. In the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency or similar event, proceedings could be initiated in any, all or any combination of the above jurisdictions. Such jurisdictions may not be as favorable to investors as the laws of the United States or other jurisdictions with which investors are familiar, and proceedings in these jurisdictions are likely to be complex and costly for creditors and otherwise may result in greater uncertainty and delay regarding the enforcement of your rights. Your rights under the Notes, the Notes Guarantees and the Notes Collateral will be subject to such bankruptcy, insolvency and administrative laws and there can be no assurance that you will be able to effectively enforce your rights in such complex, multiple bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceedings. See “—Each Notes Guarantee will be subject to certain limitations _on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability”._ In particular, French bankruptcy laws and regulations are unfavorable to creditors in many respects. Applicable fraudulent transfer and conveyance principles, insolvency laws and limitations on the enforceability of judgments obtained in France could limit the enforceability of the Notes, of the Notes Guarantees or of the security interests over the Notes Collateral. The insolvency court may also in certain circumstances void the security interests if insolvency proceedings have been commenced against a company incorporated in France. For a brief description of certain aspects of insolvency laws in France, see “Limitation on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes _Guarantees and the Security Interests and Insolvency Laws of Certain Jurisdictions—France—French insolvency laws”._ In addition, in the event that the Issuer, the Guarantors and any future guarantor, if any, or any of the Group’s other subsidiaries experiences financial difficulty, the bankruptcy, insolvency, administrative and other laws of ----- the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ jurisdictions of organization and location of assets may be materially different from, or in conflict with, each other and those of the United States, including in the areas of rights of creditors, priority of governmental and other creditors, ability to obtain post-petition interest and duration of the proceedings. The application of these laws, or any conflict among them, could call into question whether the law of any particular jurisdiction should apply, and may adversely affect the ability to enforce your rights under the Notes, the Notes Guarantees and the Notes Collateral in those jurisdictions or limit any amounts that you may receive. See “Limitation on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests and Insolvency _Laws of Certain Jurisdictions”._

Does the text mention that the company is exposed to risks associated with cyclical products?

    Title: Any Notes Guarantee will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability.
    Text: The Notes Guarantee provides the holders of the Notes with a direct claim against the relevant Guarantor. However, the Indenture will provide that such Notes Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that may be guaranteed by the relevant Guarantor without, among other things, rendering the relevant Notes Guarantee, as it relates to that Guarantor, voidable or otherwise ineffective or limited under applicable law or causing the officers of the Guarantors to incur personal civil or criminal liability, and enforcement of each such Notes Guarantee would be subject to certain generally available defenses. See “Limitation on Validity and Enforceability of the _Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests and Insolvency Laws of Certain Jurisdictions”._ Enforcement of any of the Notes Guarantees against any Guarantor, or of the security interests in respect thereof will be subject to certain defenses available to Guarantors (including the Issuer) in the relevant jurisdiction. Although laws differ among various jurisdictions, in general, under bankruptcy or insolvency law and other laws, a court could (i) void or invalidate all or a portion of a Guarantor’s obligations under its Notes Guarantee or the security interests in respect thereof, (ii) direct that the holders of the Notes return any amounts paid under a Notes Guarantee to the relevant Guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of the Guarantor’s creditors or (iii) take other action that is detrimental to you, typically if the court found that: - the relevant Notes Guarantee was incurred with actual intent to give preference to one creditor over another, hinder, delay or defraud creditors or shareholders of the relevant Guarantor or, in certain jurisdictions, when the granting of the Notes Guarantee has the effect of giving a creditor a preference or when the recipient was aware that the relevant Guarantor was insolvent when it granted the relevant Notes Guarantee; - the relevant Guarantor did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value or corporate benefit for the relevant Notes Guarantee and such Guarantor was: (i) insolvent or rendered insolvent because of the relevant Notes Guarantee; (ii) undercapitalized or became undercapitalized because of the relevant Notes Guarantee; or (iii) intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, indebtedness beyond its ability to pay at maturity; - the relevant Notes Guarantee was held to exceed or breach financial assistance rules or the corporate objects of the Guarantors or not to be in the best interests or for the corporate benefit of the Guarantors; or - the amount paid or payable under the relevant Notes Guarantee was in excess of the maximum amount permitted under applicable law. These or similar laws may also apply to any future guarantee granted by any of the Group’s subsidiaries pursuant to the Indenture. Limitations on the enforceability of judgments obtained in New York courts in such jurisdictions could limit the enforceability of the Notes Guarantee against the Guarantor. We cannot assure you which standard a court would apply in determining whether a Guarantor was “insolvent” at the relevant time or that, regardless of the method of the valuation, a court would not determine that a Guarantor was insolvent on that date, or that a court would not determine, regardless of whether or not a Guarantor was insolvent on the date its Notes Guarantee was issued, that payments for the benefit of holders of the Notes constituted preferences, fraudulent transfers or conveyances on other grounds. The measures of insolvency for purposes of fraudulent transfer laws vary depending upon applicable governing law. Generally, an entity would be considered insolvent if, at the time it incurred indebtedness: ----- - the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, is greater than the fair value of all its assets; - the present fair saleable value of its assets is less than the amount required to pay the probable liability on its existing debts and liabilities, including contingent liabilities, as they become due; or - it cannot pay with its available assets its debts as they become due. The liability of each Guarantor under its Notes Guarantee will be contractually limited to the amount that will result in such Notes Guarantee not constituting a preference, fraudulent conveyance or improper corporate distribution or otherwise being set aside. However, there can be no assurance as to what standard a court will apply in making a determination of the maximum liability of each Guarantor. There is a possibility that the entire Notes Guarantee may be set aside, in which case the entire liability may be extinguished. If a court decided that a Notes Guarantee was a preference, fraudulent transfer or conveyance and voided such Notes Guarantee, or held it unenforceable for any other reason, you or the Security Agent for your benefit may cease to have any claim in respect of the relevant Guarantor and would be a creditor solely of the Issuer and, if applicable, of any other Guarantor under the relevant Notes Guarantee that has not been declared void. In the event that any Notes Guarantee is invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, or to the extent the agreed limitation of the Guarantee obligations apply, the Notes would be effectively subordinated to all liabilities of the applicable Guarantor, and if the Issuer cannot satisfy its obligations under the Notes or any Notes Guarantee is found to be a preference, fraudulent transfer or conveyance or is otherwise set aside, you may not be repaid in full amounts outstanding under the Notes. See “Limitation on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees _and the Security Interests and Insolvency Laws of Certain Jurisdictions”._

    Title: The Issuer may not be able to obtain enough funds necessary to finance an offer to repurchase the Notes upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a change of control triggering event (as defined in the applicable Indenture) as required by the Indenture.
    Text: Upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a change of control triggering event, the Issuer will be required to offer to repurchase all the applicable outstanding Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof on the date of purchase plus accrued and unpaid interest if any, to (but excluding) the date of purchase. If a change of control triggering event were to occur, there can be no assurances that the Issuer would have sufficient funds available at such time to pay such purchase price or that the restrictions in agreements and instruments governing the Group’s debt would allow such Issuer to make such required repurchases. Additionally, under the Existing Revolving Credit Facilities a change of control triggering event (as defined therein) constitutes a mandatory prepayment event and an automatic cancellation of the facilities thereunder and under the Existing Term Loans a change of control triggering event (as defined therein) constitutes an event of default permitting the lenders to accelerate the maturity of borrowings under the Existing Term Loans Agreement and the commitments thereunder to lend would terminate. The Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the holders of the Notes, and its other indebtedness following the occurrence of a change of control triggering event may be limited by the Group’s then existing financial resources. Sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. Furthermore, the Issuer’s ability to repurchase the Notes may be limited by law. If an event constituting a change of control triggering event occurs at a time when any of the Issuer is prohibited from repurchasing the Notes, under the agreements and instruments governing the Group’s debt, the Issuer may be required to seek the consent of the creditors under such indebtedness to purchase the Notes or may attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If we do not obtain such consent or refinance such borrowings, we will remain prohibited from any such repurchases. In addition, we expect that we would require third party financing to make an offer to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control triggering event, as set forth in the Indenture. The Group cannot assure you that it would be able to obtain such financing. Any failure by the Issuer to offer to purchase Notes would constitute a default under the Indenture, which could, in turn, constitute a default under other agreements governing the Group’s debt. See “Description of Notes—Change of Control”. The change of control triggering event provisions contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection in the event of certain important corporate events, including reorganizations, restructurings, mergers, recapitalizations or other similar transaction involving us that may adversely affect you, because such corporate events may not involve a shift in voting power or beneficial ownership or, even if they do, may not constitute a “change of control triggering event” as defined in the Indenture. Except as described under “Description of _Notes—Change of Control”, the Indenture will not contain provisions requiring the Group to offer to make_ ----- repurchases or redemptions, in the event of a reorganization, restructuring, merger, recapitalization or similar transaction. The definition of “change of control” to be contained in the Indenture includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer, and its restricted subsidiaries taken as whole to any person other than certain permitted holders. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all”, there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries taken as a whole. In addition, holders of the Notes may not be entitled to require the Issuer to purchase its Notes in certain circumstances involving a significant change in the composition of Altice Europe’s board of directors, including in connection with a proxy contest, where Altice Europe’s board of directors initially publicly opposes the election of a dissident slate of directors, but subsequently approves such directors for the purposes of the Indenture. This may result in a change in the composition of the board of directors that, but for such subsequent approval, would have otherwise constituted a change of control requiring a repurchase offer under the terms of the Indenture. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a change of control has occurred and whether the Issuer is required to make an offer to repurchase its Notes.

    Title: The Group cannot assure you that an active trading market will develop for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes will be limited.
    Text: The Group cannot assure you as to: - the liquidity of any market that may develop for the Notes; - the Group’s ability to sell your Notes; or - the prices at which you would be able to sell your Notes. Future trading prices of the Notes will depend on many factors, including, among other things, prevailing interest rates, our operating results and the market for similar securities. Historically, the market for non-investment grade securities has been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to the Notes, as applicable. The liquidity of a trading market for the Notes, as applicable, may be adversely affected by a general decline in the market for similar securities and is subject to disruptions that may cause volatility in prices. It is possible that the market for the Notes will be subject to disruptions. Any such disruption may have a negative effect on you, as a holder of the Notes, as applicable, regardless of our prospects and financial performance. The Initial Purchasers have advised the Issuer that they currently intend to make a market in the Notes. However, the Initial Purchasers are not obliged to do so, and they may discontinue any market making activities at any time without notice. As a result, there is no assurance that an active trading market will develop for the Notes. If no active trading market develops, you may not be able to resell your Notes at a fair value, if at all.

    Title: The Notes may not become, or remain, listed on the Official List of The International Stock Exchange.
    Text: Although the Issuer will agree in the Indenture to use commercially reasonable efforts to have the Notes listed on the Exchange within a reasonable period after the Issue Date, and to maintain such listing as long as the Notes are outstanding, the Issuer cannot assure you that the Notes will become or remain listed. If the Issuer is unable to or can no longer maintain the listing on the Exchange, the Issuer may cease to make or maintain such listing on the Exchange, provided that it will use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and maintain the listing of the Notes on another recognized stock exchange, although there can be no assurance that the Issuer will be able to do so. Although no assurance is made as to the liquidity of the Notes as a result of listing on the Exchange or another recognized listing exchange for high yield issuers in accordance with the Indenture, failure to be approved for listing or the delisting of the Notes from the Exchange or another listing exchange in accordance with the applicable Indenture may have a material adverse effect on a holder’s ability to resell Notes in the secondary market.

    Title: Transactions in the Notes could be subject to the European financial transaction tax, if adopted.
    Text: On February 14, 2013, the European Commission published a proposal for a Directive for a common financial transaction tax (the “EU FTT”) in Austria, Belgium, Estonia, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Slovenia, ----- Slovakia and Spain (together, except for Estonia, the “Participating Member States”) and which, if enacted and implemented by France, should replace the French financial transaction tax provided for by Article 235 ter ZD of the FTC. Following the ECOFIN Council meeting of December 8, 2015, Estonia officially announced its withdrawal from the negotiations and, on March 16, 2016, completed the formalities required to leave the enhanced cooperation on the EU FTT. The EU FTT could, if introduced in its current draft form, apply, under certain circumstances, to some transactions involving the Notes and to persons both established within and outside the Participating Member States. The EU FTT proposal remains subject to negotiations between the Participating Member States, the scope of such tax being therefore uncertain. The timing of its implementation remains also unclear. Additional Member States may decide to participate and certain of the Participating Member States may decide to withdraw. At the ECOFIN Council meeting of June 14, 2019, a state of play of the work on the EU FTT was presented on the basis of a note prepared by Germany on June 7, 2019 indicating a consensus among the Participating Member States (excluding Estonia) to continue negotiations on the basis of a joint French-German proposal based on the French financial transactions tax model which in principle would only concern shares of listed companies whose head office is in a Member State of the European Union. However, such proposal is still subject to change until a final approval. Respective holders of the Notes are advised to seek their own professional advice in relation to the consequences of the EU FTT associated with subscribing for, purchasing, holding and disposing of the Notes.

    Title: Credit ratings may not reflect all risks.
    Text: The credit ratings assigned to the Notes are an assessment by the relevant rating agencies of the Issuer’s ability to pay its debts when due, which is, in respect of payment obligations under the Notes dependent upon dividends, others distributions and other payments from its subsidiaries to meet its obligations. Consequently, real or anticipated changes in our or the Notes’ credit ratings may generally affect the market value of the Notes. Ratings may not reflect the potential impact of all risks relating to structure, market and additional factors discussed in this Offering Memorandum, and other factors not discussed herein may affect the value of the Notes. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be revised or withdrawn by the rating agency at any time. An explanation of the significance of such rating may be obtained from the applicable rating agency. There is no assurance that such credit ratings will be issued or remain in effect for any given period of time or that such ratings will not be lowered, suspended or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies, if, in the applicable rating agency’s judgment, circumstances so warrant. It is also possible that such ratings may be lowered in connection with the application of the proceeds of this offering or in connection with future events, such as future acquisitions. Holders of the Notes will have no recourse against us or any other parties in the event of a change in or suspension or withdrawal of such ratings. Any lowering, suspension or withdrawal of such ratings may have an adverse effect on the market price or marketability of the Notes.

    Title: Certain covenants may be suspended upon the occurrence of a change in our ratings.
    Text: The Indenture will provide that, if at any time following the date of the Indenture, the Notes are rated Baa3 or better by Moody’s and BBB- or better from S&P and no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing, then beginning that day the following provisions of the Indenture will not apply: “—Limitation on Indebtedness”, “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”, “—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted _Subsidiaries”, “—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock”, “—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions”,_ “—Additional Guarantors” and “—Impairment of Security Interests” and the provisions of clause (3) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Merger and Consolidation—The Issuer”. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the rating assigned by any such rating agency to such Notes should subsequently decline to below Baa3 or BBB-, respectively, the foregoing covenants will be reinstituted as at and from the date of such rating decline. If these covenants were to be suspended, we would be able to incur additional debt or make payments, including dividends or investments, which may conflict with the interests of holders of the Notes, as applicable. There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever achieve an investment grade rating or that any such rating will be maintained. -----

    Title: You may face currency exchange risks or adverse tax consequences by investing in the Notes denominated in currencies other than your reference currency.
    Text: The Notes will be denominated and payable in U.S. dollar and euro. If your investments are denominated in a currency other than the currency in which the Notes are denominated, an investment in the Notes will entail foreign exchange related risks due to, among other factors, possible significant changes in the value of the U.S. dollar or euro relative to such currency or other relevant currencies because of economic, political or other factors over which we have no control. Depreciation of the U.S. dollar or euro against such currency or other relevant currencies could cause a decrease in the effective yield of the Notes below their stated coupon rates and could result in a loss to you when the return on the Notes is translated into the currency by reference to which you measure the return on your investments. Investments in the Notes by U.S. investors may also have important tax consequences as a result of foreign currency exchange gains or losses, if any.

    Title: Recoveries may be limited if certain provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement are held to be unenforceable.
    Text: Pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the holders of the Notes, the lenders under the Existing Revolving Credit Facilities and the lenders of the Existing Term Loans agree to share equally in respect of any recoveries from the Guarantors (subject to the limitations set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement). In addition, although the security interests in the Notes Collateral and the Notes Guarantees will, in some cases, be junior ranking to existing liens securing the Existing Senior Secured Notes, the Existing Revolving Credit Facilities, the Existing Term Loans and certain hedging obligations, pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the holders of the Notes, the holders of the Existing Senior Secured Notes, the lenders under the Existing Revolving Credit Facilities, the lenders under the Existing Term Loans and counterparties to certain hedging obligations secured on the Notes Collateral will share in recoveries from the enforcement of the security interests in the Notes Collateral on a pari passu basis. However, there can be no assurance that all provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, will be held enforceable by French courts, as the enforceability of intercreditor arrangements has not been tested before the French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation). If any of the security interests or if any part of the sharing provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, were to be held unenforceable by French courts, you may recover less than your claims under the Notes, in the event of enforcement of the Notes Collateral.

    Title: Transfers of the Notes are restricted, which may adversely affect the value of the Notes.
    Text: The Notes are being offered and sold pursuant to an exemption from registration under the U.S. Securities Act and applicable state securities laws of the United States. The Notes have not been, and will not be, registered under the U.S. Securities Act or any U.S. state securities laws. Therefore, you may not transfer or sell the Notes in the United States except pursuant to an exemption from, or a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and applicable state securities laws, or pursuant to an effective registration statement, and you may be required to bear the risk of your investment in the Notes for an indefinite period of time. The Notes and the Indenture will contain provisions that restrict the Notes from being offered, sold or otherwise transferred except pursuant to the exemptions available pursuant to Rule 144A and Regulation S, or other exemptions under the U.S. Securities Act. In addition, by acceptance of delivery of any Notes, the holder thereof agrees on its own behalf and on behalf of any investor accounts for which it has purchased the Notes that it shall not transfer the Notes, in an aggregate principal amount of less than $200,000, in the case of Dollar Notes, and €100,000, in the case of Euro Notes. Furthermore, the Issuer has not registered the Notes under any other ----- country’s securities laws. It is your obligation to ensure that your offers and sales of the Notes within the United States and other countries comply with applicable securities laws. See “Notice to Investors”.

    Title: You may be unable to recover in civil proceedings for U.S. securities laws violations.
    Text: The Issuer is incorporated under the laws of France and the Guarantors are incorporated under the laws of France, Luxembourg and the United States. It is anticipated that some or all of the directors and executive officers of the Issuer and the Guarantors incorporated in France and Luxembourg will be non-residents of the United States and that all or a majority of their assets will be located outside the United States. As a result, it may not be possible for investors to effect service of process within the United States upon the Issuer, the Guarantors incorporated in France or Luxembourg or their respective directors and executive officers, or to enforce any judgments obtained in U.S. courts predicated upon civil liability provisions of the U.S. securities laws. Additionally, there is doubt as to the enforceability in many foreign jurisdictions of civil liabilities based on the civil liability provisions of the federal or state securities laws of the United States against the Issuer, the Guarantors incorporated in France and Luxembourg, the directors, controlling persons and management and any experts named in this Offering Memorandum who are not residents of the United States.

    Text: _An investment in the Notes involves risks. Before purchasing the Notes, you should consider carefully the specific risk factors set forth below, as well as the other information contained in this Offering Memorandum. If any of the events described below, individually or in combination, were to occur, this could have a material adverse impact on the Group’s business, financial condition, results of operations and financial condition and ability to make payments on the Notes and could therefore have a negative effect on the trading price of the Notes. Described below and elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum are the risks considered to be the most material, although there may be other unknown or unpredictable economic, business, competitive, regulatory or other factors that could also have material adverse effects on the Group’s results of operations, financial condition, business or operations in the future. In addition, the Group’s past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance, and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. This Offering Memorandum also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including the risks described below and elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

    Title: We may not be able to complete the Acquisition or the Term Loan Financing on or during the timeline expected, or at all, or we may not realize the expected benefits of the Acquisition.
    Text: On September 7, 2021, we announced that we entered into the Purchase Agreement to acquire the Masterflex bioprocessing business and related assets of Antylia Scientific. We intend to use the net proceeds of the Financing Transactions, along with cash on hand and borrowings under our A/R Facility, to finance the Acquisition and to pay related fees and expenses. There is no assurance that the Transactions will be consummated on the terms contemplated, or at all, and this offering is not conditioned on the completion of the Acquisition or the Term Loan Financing. In the event this offering of notes is consummated prior to the completion of the Acquisition then, pending the consummation of the Acquisition then the notes will be subject to certain special mandatory redemption provisions. To the extent the Acquisition is not consummated or certain other conditions are not met, the notes will be subject to special mandatory redemption. See “—If the Acquisition is not consummated by the Outside Date or certain other conditions are not met, the Issuer will be required to redeem the notes, which means that you may not obtain the return you expect on the notes” and “Description of Notes—Special Mandatory Redemption.” In addition, regardless of whether we close the Acquisition, the expected benefits of the Acquisition may not materialize in the expected manner or timeframe or at all, including due to potential complications with respect to Masterflex’s integration; potential disruptions to Masterflex’s management or current or future plans and operations due to the Acquisition; or domestic or international litigation developments, investigations, or otherwise. Failure to realize the expected benefits of the Acquisition could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results following the consummation of the Acquisition and many of these costs will be borne by us even if the Acquisition is not consummated. In addition, if a qualitative assessment of impairment of our investment in Masterflex were to indicate that its fair value is less than its carrying value, the investment would be written down to its fair value, which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial position.

    Text: The net proceeds from the offering relating to the notes will not be sufficient to pay the special mandatory redemption price with respect to the notes. The special mandatory redemption price for the notes will be a price equal to 100% of the issue price of the notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest on the notes from the initial issue date ----- to the redemption date. In the event of a special mandatory redemption, we will need to fund the balance of the special mandatory redemption price from other sources of liquidity.

    Title: The Issuer has a substantial amount of indebtedness which could adversely affect the Issuer’s financial condition, and prevent the Issuer from fulfilling its obligations under the notes.
    Text: After completion of the Transactions, the Issuer will have a substantial amount of indebtedness, which requires us to make significant interest and principal payments. On an as-adjusted basis after giving effect to the Transactions and the use of proceeds therefrom, the Issuer and the Issuer’s subsidiaries would have had approximately $7,533.3 million of indebtedness as of June 30, 2021, including the notes offered hereby, and estimated cash interest for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021 would have been approximately $297.0 million. On an as-adjusted basis after giving effect to the Transactions, the Issuer would also have had an additional $515.0 million available for borrowing under the Revolver (excluding issued but undrawn letters of credit) and an additional $200.0 million would have been available for borrowing under the A/R Facility (excluding issued but undrawn letters of credit). The Issuer’s substantial level of indebtedness could have important consequences to us and to the holders of the notes, including the following: - making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the notes and or other debt; - exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates as certain of our borrowings, including borrowings under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, are at variable rates of interest, which could further adversely impact our cash flows; - restricting us from making strategic acquisitions or causing us to make non-strategic divestitures; - requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, which would reduce the funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, investments, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes; - limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business, future business opportunities and the industry in which we operate; - placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to any of our less leveraged competitors; - increasing our vulnerability to a downturn in our business and both general and industry-specific adverse economic conditions; and - limiting our ability to obtain additional financing at a favorable cost of borrowing, or at all, or to dispose of assets to raise funds, to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, investments, acquisitions or other general corporate requirements. The Issuer and the Issuer’s subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, subject to the restrictions contained in the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the indentures that govern the Existing Notes and the indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby. To the extent the Issuer and the Issuer’s subsidiaries incur further indebtedness, the substantial risks related to the Issuer’s level of indebtedness would increase. See “Description of Notes.” The Issuer’s ability to meet expenses, to remain in compliance with its covenants under such debt instruments and to make future principal and interest payments in respect of the Issuer’s debt depends on, among ----- other things, the Issuer’s operating performance, competitive developments and financial market conditions, all of which are significantly affected by financial, business, economic and other factors. The Issuer is not able to control many of these factors. Given current industry and economic conditions, the Issuer’s cash flow may not be sufficient to allow the Issuer to pay principal and interest on its debt, including the notes, the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, and the Existing Notes, and meet its other obligations.

    Title: Due to many factors beyond the Issuer’s control, including as a result of the impact of COVID-19, the Issuer may not have sufficient cash flows from operating activities to service all of the Issuer’s indebtedness, including the notes, the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the Existing Notes, and meet the Issuer’s other ongoing liquidity needs, and it may be forced to take other actions to satisfy the Issuer’s obligations under its debt agreements, which may not be successful.
    Text: The Issuer’s ability to make payments on and to refinance its indebtedness, including the notes, the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the Existing Notes, will depend on its ability to generate cash in the future. The Issuer’s ability to generate cash will be subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors, some of which are beyond the Issuer’s control, such as the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Issuer’s future cash flow, cash on hand or available borrowings may not be sufficient to meet such obligations and commitments. If the Issuer is unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service its indebtedness and to meet its other commitments, the Issuer will be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as refinancing or restructuring the Issuer’s indebtedness (including the notes), selling material assets or operations or seeking to raise additional debt or equity capital. These actions may not be effected on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms or at all, or these actions may not enable us to continue to satisfy the Issuer’s capital requirements. In addition, the Issuer’s existing or future debt agreements contain and will contain restrictive covenants that may prohibit us from adopting any of these alternatives. The Issuer’s failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all its debts. See “Description of Notes.” In addition, the Issuer conducts substantially all of its operations through its subsidiaries, certain of which will not be issuers or guarantors of the notes or its other indebtedness. Accordingly, repayment of such indebtedness, including the notes, will be dependent in part on the generation of cash flow by its subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us, by dividend, debt repayment or otherwise. Unless they are guarantors of the notes, the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the Existing Notes or such other indebtedness, the subsidiaries will not have any obligation to pay amounts due on the notes, the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the Existing Notes or such other indebtedness, as applicable, or to make funds available for that purpose. The Issuer’s subsidiaries may not be able to, or may not be permitted to, make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of the Issuer’s indebtedness, including the notes. Each subsidiary is a distinct legal entity, and under certain circumstances legal and contractual restrictions may limit the Issuer’s ability to obtain cash from the Issuer’s subsidiaries. While the indentures that govern the Existing Notes, the credit agreement that governs the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the agreements governing certain of our other indebtedness limit, and the indenture that will govern the notes will limit, the ability of certain of the Issuer’s subsidiaries to incur consensual restrictions on their ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany payments to the Issuer, these limitations are, in the case of our existing debt, and will be, in the case of the notes offered hereby, subject to certain qualifications and exceptions. In the event that the Issuer does not receive distributions from its subsidiaries, the Issuer may be unable to make the required principal and interest payments on the Issuer’s indebtedness, including the notes. If the Issuer cannot make scheduled payments on its debt, the Issuer will be in default, and as a result, holders of the notes and certain of its other indebtedness could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable, the lenders under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities could foreclose against the assets securing the borrowings under such agreements and the Issuer could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation, which, in each case, could result in your losing all or a portion of your investment in the notes. -----

    Title: The notes and the related guarantees will be unsecured and will be effectively subordinated to the Issuer’s and the guarantors’ indebtedness under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the Existing Secured Notes and any of their other secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness.
    Text: The notes and the related guarantees are not secured by any of the Issuer’s and the guarantors’ assets and therefore are effectively subordinated to the claims of their respective secured debt holders (including, without limitation, the lenders under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the holders of the Existing Secured Notes) to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. The notes will be effectively subordinated to all such secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the Existing Secured Notes. As of June 30, 2021, on an as-adjusted basis after giving effect to the Transactions, the aggregate amount of the Issuer’s and the Issuer’s subsidiaries secured indebtedness would have been $4,709.3 million, and there would have been $515.0 million (excluding issued but undrawn letters of credit) of availability under the Revolver and $200.0 million of availability under the A/R Facility (excluding issued but undrawn letters of credit), all of which would have been effectively senior to the notes to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. In addition, the Issuer is permitted to add incremental facilities under the credit agreement that governs the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and additional secured indebtedness, including additional Existing Secured Notes, under the indentures governing the Existing Notes, in each case, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. The indenture that will govern the notes will also permit us to incur additional secured indebtedness, which could be substantial and the holders of which will also be entitled to the remedies available to a secured lender. See “Description of Notes.” If the Issuer becomes insolvent or is liquidated, or if payment under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities or under the Existing Secured Notes is accelerated, the holders of such senior secured indebtedness will be entitled to exercise the remedies available to a secured holder under applicable law (in addition to any remedies that may be available under documents pertaining to such indebtedness). If an event of default occurs under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities or under the indenture that governs the Existing Secured Notes, the holders of such senior secured indebtedness will have a prior right to the Issuer’s assets, to the exclusion of the holders of the notes, even if the Issuer is in default with respect to the notes. In that event, the Issuer’s assets would first be used to repay in full all indebtedness and other obligations secured thereby (including all amounts outstanding under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the Existing Secured Notes), resulting in all or a portion of the Issuer’s assets being unavailable to satisfy the claims of the holders of the notes and other unsecured indebtedness. Therefore, in the event of any distribution or payment of the Issuer’s assets in any foreclosure, dissolution, winding-up, liquidation, reorganization or other bankruptcy or reorganization proceeding, holders of the notes will participate in the Issuer’s remaining assets ratably with each other and with all holders of the Issuer’s unsecured indebtedness that is deemed to be of the same class as the notes, and potentially with all of the Issuer’s other general creditors, based upon the respective amounts owed to each holder or creditor. In any of the foregoing events, the Issuer cannot assure you that there will be sufficient assets to pay amounts due on the notes. As a result, holders of the notes may receive less, ratably, than holders of the Issuer’s secured indebtedness.

    Title: A significant portion of our net sales and assets are derived from entities that will not be guarantors of the notes. The notes and the guarantees will be structurally subordinated to all liabilities of the Issuer’s non-guarantor subsidiaries.
    Text: From and after the consummation of this offering, the notes offered hereby will be guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by Holdings and all of Holdings’ existing and future domestic subsidiaries to the extent each such subsidiary guarantees the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. However, the guarantee of the notes by a subsidiary will be automatically released under certain circumstances. See “Description of Notes—Guarantees.” In addition, the indentures that govern the Existing Notes permit, and the indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby will permit, the Issuer’s subsidiaries, including the Issuer’s non-guarantor subsidiaries, to incur certain additional indebtedness, and will not limit their ability to incur trade payables and similar liabilities that are not considered indebtedness thereunder. You will not have any claim as a creditor against any of the Issuer’s non-guarantor subsidiaries. Furthermore, in the event that any non-guarantor subsidiary becomes insolvent or is liquidated, reorganized or ----- dissolved, the assets of such non-guarantor subsidiary will be used first to satisfy the claims of its creditors, including trade creditors, banks and other lenders, followed by claims of any holders of preferred stock of such nonguarantor subsidiary. Only the residual equity value will be available to us and the Issuer’s guarantors, and only to the extent the Issuer or any guarantor is a parent company of such non-guarantor subsidiary. Consequently, each guarantee of the notes will be structurally subordinated to claims of creditors of non-guarantor subsidiaries. In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation or dissolution of any non-guarantor subsidiaries, holders of their debt, including their trade creditors, secured creditors and creditors holding indebtedness or guarantees issued by those subsidiaries, are generally entitled to payment on their claims from assets of those subsidiaries before any assets are made available for distribution to us. Excluding the effect of intercompany balances as well as intercompany transactions, after giving effect to the Transactions, the non-guarantor subsidiaries of the Issuer accounted for approximately $3,185.3 million, or 45.2%, of its net sales for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, and approximately $7,692.0 million, or 68.4%, of its total assets as of June 30, 2021, and would have accounted for approximately $138.9 million, or 1.8%, of its total gross indebtedness including capital lease obligations as of June 30, 2021.

    Title: There are circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the notes under which the guarantees will be released automatically, without your consent or the consent of the trustee.
    Text: Under various circumstances, the guarantees of the notes will be released automatically. The guarantee of a guarantor of the notes will be automatically released to the extent such guarantor is released in connection with a sale or other disposition of the equity interests of such guarantor in a transaction not prohibited by the indenture that will govern the notes. The indenture also will permit us to designate one or more of the Issuer’s restricted subsidiaries that is a guarantor of the notes as an unrestricted subsidiary, which will result in the guarantee of such guarantor being automatically released. If a guarantor is released from its guarantee of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and certain other indebtedness of the Issuer or any other guarantor, other than in connection with a refinancing of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and such other indebtedness or a payment under such guarantee, or a guarantor ceases to be a subsidiary as a result of any foreclosure of any pledge or security interest securing the secured indebtedness, such subsidiary’s guarantee of the notes will be automatically released as well. If the guarantee of any guarantor is released, no holder of the notes will have a claim as a creditor against that subsidiary, and the indebtedness and other liabilities, including trade payables and preferred stock, if any, whether secured or unsecured, of that subsidiary will be structurally senior to the claim of any holders of the notes. For a description of all circumstances in which a guarantor’s subsidiary guarantee will be automatically released, see “Description of Notes—Guarantees.”

    Title: The credit agreement that governs the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the indentures that govern the Existing Notes restrict, and the indenture that will govern the notes will restrict, the Issuer’s current and future operations, particularly the Issuer’s ability to respond to changes or to take certain actions, and as a result, may adversely affect the Issuer’s business, financial condition and results of operations.
    Text: The credit agreement that governs the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the indentures that govern the Existing Notes restrict contain, and the indenture that will govern the notes will contain, a number of covenants that, ----- among other things, may adversely affect the Issuer’s ability to finance its future operations or capital needs or engage in other business activities that may be in the Issuer’s interest. The agreements governing the Issuer’s indebtedness restrict or will restrict, subject to certain exceptions, the Issuer’s ability and the ability of the Issuer’s restricted subsidiaries to, among other things: - incur additional indebtedness and guarantee indebtedness; - pay dividends or make other distributions in respect of, or repurchase or redeem, capital stock; - prepay, redeem or repurchase certain debt; - make loans and investments; - sell or otherwise dispose of assets; - sell stock of the Issuer’s subsidiaries; - create or incur liens; - enter into certain transactions with affiliates; - enter into agreements restricting the Issuer’s and the Issuer’s subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends or to incur liens on assets; - enter into amendments to certain subordinated indebtedness in a manner materially adverse to the lenders; and - consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of the Issuer’s assets. In addition, any future financing arrangements entered into by us may contain similar restrictions. As a result of these covenants and restrictions, the Issuer is and will be limited in how the Issuer conducts its business, and the Issuer may be unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities. In addition, the Issuer will be required to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy other financial condition tests. The terms of any future indebtedness the Issuer may incur could include more restrictive covenants. The Issuer cannot assure you that it will be able to maintain compliance with these covenants in the future and, if the Issuer fails to do so, that the Issuer will be able to obtain waivers from the lenders and/or amend the covenants. Events beyond our control, including the impact of COVID-19, may affect our ability to comply with our covenants. The Issuer’s failure to comply with the restrictive covenants described above as well as others contained in the Issuer’s future debt instruments from time to time could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could result in the Issuer being required to repay these borrowings before their maturity. If the Issuer is forced to refinance these borrowings on less favorable terms or cannot refinance these borrowings, the Issuer’s results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.

    Title: Reforms, including the phasing out of LIBOR after 2021, may adversely affect us.
    Text: We have floating rate debt, the interest rate of which is determined based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”). LIBOR and other “benchmark” rates are subject to ongoing national and international regulatory scrutiny and reform. For example, on July 27, 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (the “FCA”) announced that it will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of the LIBOR rates after 2021 (the “FCA Announcement”). On March 5, 2021, the FCA announced in a public statement the future cessation of quotations for tenors of overnight/Spot next, 1-month, 3-month, 6-month and 12-month U.S.-dollar LIBOR. The FCA’s announcements indicate that LIBOR will not continue to exist on the current basis. U.S.-dollar LIBOR is expected to be replaced with the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”), a new index calculated by reference ----- to short-term repurchase agreements for U.S. Treasury securities. Although there have been a few issuances utilizing SOFR or the Sterling Over Night Index Average, an alternative reference rate that is based on transactions, it is unknown whether any of these alternative reference rates will attain market acceptance as replacements for LIBOR. There is currently no definitive successor reference rate to LIBOR and various industry organizations are still working to develop workable transition mechanisms. As part of this industry transition, we will be required to migrate any current adjustable rate loans we service to any such successor reference rate. Until a successor rate is determined, we cannot implement the transition away from LIBOR for the adjustable rate loans we service. As such, we are unable to predict the effect of any changes to LIBOR, the establishment and success of any alternative reference rates, or any other reforms to LIBOR or any replacement of LIBOR that may be enacted in the United States or elsewhere. Such changes, reforms or replacements relating to LIBOR could have an adverse impact on the market for or value of any LIBOR-linked securities, loans, derivatives or other financial instruments or extensions of credit held by us. LIBOR-related changes could affect our overall results of operations and financial condition. The outcome of reforms may result in increased interest expense to us, affect our ability to incur debt on terms acceptable to us and may result in increased costs related to amending our existing debt instruments, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

    Title: Federal and state statutes may allow courts, under specific circumstances, to avoid the notes and the guarantees relating to the notes, subordinate claims in respect of the notes and the guarantees and/or require holders of the notes to return payments received from us in respect of the guarantees.
    Text: The incurrence of indebtedness evidenced by the notes and the guarantees may be subject to review and challenge under relevant state and federal fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer statutes in a bankruptcy or reorganization case or a lawsuit by or on behalf of the Issuer’s creditors outside of bankruptcy. Under these statutes, the notes and the guarantees could be avoided, or claims in respect of the notes and the guarantees could be subordinated to all of the Issuer’s other indebtedness, if a court were to find at the time the Issuer or such guarantor issued the notes or incurred a guarantee of the notes, that the Issuer or the applicable guarantor received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for issuing the note or incurring the guarantee, and: - intended to hinder, delay or defraud any present or future creditor; - was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of the incurrence of such indebtedness; - was engaged in, or about to engage in, a business or transaction for which the Issuer’s or the guarantor’s remaining assets constituted unreasonably small capital; or - intended to incur, or believed that the Issuer or guarantor would incur, indebtedness beyond the Issuer’s or such guarantor’s ability to repay such debts as they mature. A court might also avoid the issuance of the notes or a guarantee, without regard to the above factors, if the court found that the Issuer issued the notes or the guarantors entered into the applicable guarantee with actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud the Issuer’s or the guarantors’ respective creditors. If a court were to avoid the issuance of the Notes or the guarantees, you would no longer have a claim against us or the guarantors. Sufficient funds to repay the notes may not be available from other sources, including the remaining guarantors, if any. If a note or a guarantee is avoided as a fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer or found to be unenforceable for any reason, you will not have a claim against that obligor and will only be a creditor of the Issuer or any guarantor to the extent the Issuer’s or such guarantor’s obligation is not set aside or found to be unenforceable. You may also be required to return payments you have received, as the court might direct you to repay any amounts that you already received from us or the guarantors with respect to such note and guarantees. In addition, any payment by us pursuant to the notes or by a guarantor made at a time when the Issuer or such guarantor is subsequently found to be insolvent could be avoided and required to be returned to us or such guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of the Issuer’s or the guarantor’s creditors if such payment is made to an insider within a one-year period prior to a bankruptcy filing or within 90 days to any non-insider party and such ----- payment would give the holders of notes more than such holders of notes would have received in a liquidation under Title 11 of the United States Code, as amended, or the “Bankruptcy Code.” As a general matter, value is given for a transfer or an obligation if, in exchange for the transfer or obligation, property is transferred or a valid antecedent debt is satisfied. A court would likely find that a guarantor did not receive reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for such guarantee if such guarantor did not substantially benefit directly or indirectly from the issuance of the notes and/or such guarantee. Thus, if the guarantees were legally challenged, any guarantee could be subject to the claim that, since the guarantee was incurred for the Issuer’s benefit, and only indirectly for the benefit of the guarantor, the obligations of the applicable guarantor were incurred for less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration. The measures of insolvency for purposes of these fraudulent conveyance or transfer and preferences laws will vary depending upon the law applied in any proceeding. Generally, however, the Issuer would be considered insolvent if: - the sum of the Issuer’s indebtedness, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the fair value of all the Issuer’s assets; - the present fair saleable value of the Issuer’s assets were less than the amount that would be required to pay the Issuer’s probable liability on existing indebtedness, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or - the Issuer could not pay the Issuer’s debts as they become due. The Issuer cannot assure you as to the standard a court would apply in making such determinations or that a court would agree with the Issuer’s conclusions in this regard that the Issuer and the guarantors will not be insolvent or rendered insolvent by the issuance of the notes and the guarantees. Regardless of the actual standard applied by the court, we cannot be certain that the issuance of the notes or a guarantee would not be avoided as a preference, fraudulent transfer, fraudulent conveyance, or otherwise, or that the issuance of the notes and the guarantees would not be subordinated to the Issuer’s or any guarantor’s other debt. The indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby will contain a “savings clause,” which limits the liability of each guarantor on its guarantee to the maximum amount that such guarantor can incur without risk that its guarantee will be subject to avoidance as a fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer. The Issuer cannot assure you such a savings clause limitation, as a legal matter will protect such guarantees from fraudulent conveyance or transfer challenges or, if it does, that the remaining amount due and collectible under the guarantees would suffice, if necessary, to pay the notes in full. Finally, as a court of equity, the bankruptcy court may subordinate the claims in respect of the notes to other claims against us under the principle of “equitable subordination”, if the court determines that: (1) the holders of the notes engaged in some type of inequitable conduct; (2) such inequitable conduct resulted in injury to the Issuer’s other creditors or conferred an unfair advantage upon the holder of the notes; and (3) equitable subordination is not inconsistent with the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code.

    Title: The Issuer may not be able to repurchase the notes upon a Change of Control required by the indenture that will govern the notes.
    Text: Upon a Change of Control, as defined under the indenture that will govern the notes, you will have the right to require the Issuer to offer to purchase the notes then outstanding at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount of such notes, plus accrued interest. In order to obtain sufficient funds to pay the purchase price of the outstanding notes, the Issuer may need to refinance the notes and/or the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. However, it is possible that the Issuer will not have sufficient funds at the time of the change of control to make the required repurchase of the notes. If the Issuer is required to repurchase the notes, the Issuer could require third-party financing. The Issuer cannot be sure that it would be able to obtain third-party financing on acceptable terms, or at all. The Issuer’s failure to offer to purchase all outstanding notes or to purchase all validly tendered notes would be an event of default under the indenture that will govern the notes. Such an event of default may ----- cause the acceleration of the Issuer’s other debt, including debt under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. The Issuer’s future debt also may contain restrictions on repayment requirements with respect to specified events or transactions that constitute a change of control under the indenture that will govern the notes. The indentures governing the Existing Notes also contain similar change of control offer provisions. The credit agreement governing our Senior Secured Credit Facilities also provide that a change of control is an event of default that permits lenders to accelerate the maturity of borrowings thereunder. Any of our future debt arrangements may contain similar provisions. If the Issuer is required to repurchase the notes pursuant to a change of control offer and repay certain amounts outstanding under such other indebtedness, the Issuer would probably require third-party financing. The Issuer cannot be sure that it would be able to obtain third-party financing on acceptable terms, or at all. If the indebtedness under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities is not paid, the lenders thereunder may seek to enforce security interests in the collateral, thereby limiting the Issuer’s ability to raise cash to purchase the notes, and reducing the practical benefit of the offer to purchase provisions to the holders of the notes.

    Title: Holders of notes may not be able to determine when a change of control giving rise to their right to have the notes purchased has occurred following a sale of “substantially all” of the Issuer’s assets.
    Text: One of the circumstances under which a change of control may occur is upon the sale or disposition of all or substantially all of the Issuer’s assets. However, the phrase “all or substantially all” will likely be interpreted under applicable state law and will be dependent upon particular facts and circumstances. As a result, there may be a degree of uncertainty in ascertaining whether a sale or disposition of “all or substantially all” of the Issuer’s capital stock or assets has occurred, in which case, the ability of a holder of the notes to obtain the benefit of an offer to repurchase all of a portion of the notes held by such holder may be impaired. See “Description of Notes— Repurchase at the Option of Holders.”

    Title: The Issuer can enter into transactions like recapitalizations, reorganizations and other highly leveraged transactions that do not constitute a change of control but that could adversely affect the holders of the notes.
    Text: Certain important corporate events, such as leveraged recapitalizations, may not, under the indenture that will govern the notes, constitute a “change of control” that would require the Issuer to offer to purchase the notes, notwithstanding the fact that such corporate events could increase the level of the Issuer’s indebtedness or otherwise adversely affect the Issuer’s capital structure, credit ratings or the value of the notes. Therefore, the Issuer could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions, reorganizations, refinancings or other recapitalizations, which would not constitute a change of control under the indenture that will govern the notes, but that could increase the amount of indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect the Issuer’s capital structure or credit ratings.

    Title: Your ability to transfer the notes may be limited by the absence of an active trading market, and an active trading market may not develop for the notes.
    Text: The notes will be a new issue of securities for which there is no established trading market. The Issuer expects the notes to be eligible for trading by “qualified institutional buyers,” as defined under and pursuant to Rule 144A of the Securities Act or pursuant to Regulation S, but the Issuer does not intend to list the notes on any national securities exchange or to arrange for quotation on any automated dealer quotation system. The initial purchasers have advised the Issuer that they intend to make a market in the notes, as permitted by applicable laws and regulations; however, the initial purchasers are not obligated to make a market in the notes and, if commenced, they may discontinue their market-making activities at any time without notice. Therefore, an active market for the notes may not develop or be maintained, which would adversely affect the market price and liquidity of the notes. In such case, the holders of the notes may not be able to sell their notes at a particular time or at a favorable price. If a trading market were to develop, future trading prices of the notes may be volatile and will depend on many factors, some of which are beyond the Issuer’s control, including: - the number of holders of notes; - the Issuer’s operating performance and financial condition; - the market for similar securities; - the interest of securities dealers in making a market for the notes; - prevailing interest rates; and - the aggregate principal amount of notes outstanding. Even if an active trading market for the notes does develop, there is no guarantee that it will continue. Historically, the market for non-investment grade indebtedness has been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to the notes. The market, if any, for the notes may experience similar disruptions and any such disruptions may adversely affect the liquidity in that market or the prices at which you may sell your notes. In addition, subsequent to their initial issuance, the notes may trade at a discount from their initial offering price, depending upon prevailing interest rates, the market for similar notes, the Issuer’s performance and other factors.

    Title: Many of the covenants in the indenture that will govern the notes will be suspended if the notes are rated investment grade by two of the three rating agencies.
    Text: Many of the covenants in the indenture that will govern the notes will no longer apply to us during any time that the notes are rated investment grade by two of the three rating agencies, provided that at such time no default under the relevant indenture has occurred and is continuing. These covenants restrict, among other things, the Issuer’s ability to pay distributions, incur debt and enter into certain other transactions. There can be no assurance that the notes will ever be rated investment grade, or that if they are rated investment grade, that the notes will maintain these ratings. However, suspension of these covenants would allow us to engage in certain transactions that would not be permitted while these covenants were in force and any action taken while these covenants are suspended will not result in an event of default under the indenture on the basis that such actions would have been prohibited by these covenants. See “Description of Notes—Certain Covenants—Covenant Suspension.”

Any such discount that was not amortized as of the date of the bankruptcy filing would constitute unmatured interest, which is not allowable as part of a bankruptcy claim under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.

Does the text mention that the company is exposed to risks associated with cyclical products?

    Title: The COVID 19 pandemic has had, and will continue to have, a significant adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition, operating results and liquidity, and the ultimate outcome of the COVID 19 pandemic is uncertain.
    Text: In December 2019, an outbreak of the novel strain of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (“COVID 19”) was identified in Wuhan, China. This COVID 19 outbreak has since spread and grown globally, including in each of the countries in which we operate, and was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020. Although the ultimate severity and impact of the COVID 19 pandemic remains uncertain, the COVID 19 pandemic and measures taken to combat it have had, and are expected to continue to have, a significant negative impact on the economy in the countries in which we operate and the automotive industry as a whole. The measures taken to combat COVID 19 include restrictions on public life, curfews, forced temporary business closures (including the closure of significant elements of our business) and lockdowns as well as social distancing protocols and the general advice to stay at home given the health risks associated with COVID 19. As a result, all aspects of our business have been, and we expect will continue to be, materially negatively impacted. In the used vehicle market, car registration agencies and car dealerships were temporarily closed, car dealers sought to reduce their inventory and some consumers chose to delay or abandon car purchases. Due to the unprecedented level of disruption to society and the automotive industry, including to car dealers, leasing companies, fleet providers, original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”), wholesale traders and private consumers, as well as our employees and the way we operate our business, interactions at the Marketplace, particularly at physical auction and logistics sites were significantly impacted during the fiscal year 2021 with average weekly trading volume dipping to 4,000 at the start of the first quarter of the fiscal year 2021, compared to 29,000 at the start of the fourth quarter of the fiscal year 2020. In a number of countries our physical auctions and other operating sites have been required to close as a result of government legislation, as have many WeBuyAnyCar sites for periods of varying length. Interruptions to the businesses of our customers (including OEMs, leasing companies, dealers and fleet providers) resulted in unpredictable and reduced volumes of vehicles being handled by our Automotive Services division and a negative impact on trading performance. A significant proportion of our workforce (such as those involved in the physical movement of vehicles) cannot work remotely and potentially face additional risks as a result of the COVID 19 pandemic. In addition, some of our sites are visited by customers as part of their normal operations. We cannot guarantee that measures we take in order to limit the risks posed to such individuals will be sufficient and we may be subject to potential litigation or enforcement action as result of staff or customers alleging that our working practices are unsafe in this regard. Such litigation or enforcement action could result in material financial cost and damage to our reputation and brands. On July 10, 2020, out of an abundance of caution, we proactively and successfully negotiated certain covenant waivers with respect to certain of our existing debt facilities in order to mitigate the anticipated effects of the COVID 19 pandemic. These waivers were extended on January 22, 2021. However, a prolonged negative impact due to the COVID 19 pandemic or other factors may adversely affect our ability to comply with the financial covenants included in the Senior Facilities Agreement or any other similar agreement, and there can be no assurance that we would be able to successfully negotiate the covenant waivers with our lenders in such an event. The breach of a financial or other covenant or the failure to meet any of the obligations under our ----- financing agreements governing our debt may result in a default or event of default under such agreements, which in turn could result in a number of adverse consequences, including cross-defaults, the acceleration of the outstanding amounts requiring immediate repayment of the related debt in part or in whole, significant increases in interest rates and other financing and reputational costs. There is also no guarantee that debt financings will be available in the future to fund our obligations, or that they will be available on terms consistent with our expectations. The COVID 19 pandemic has caused, and is likely to continue to cause, severe economic, market and other disruptions worldwide. It cannot be assured that conditions in the credit lending, capital and other financial markets will not deteriorate as a result of the COVID 19 pandemic, or that our access to capital and other sources of funding will not become constrained or expensive, or that the credit or capital markets will be available in the future to fund our obligations. In addition, the terms of future debt agreements could include more restrictive covenants or require incremental collateral, which may restrict our business operations or make such debt unavailable due to our covenant restrictions then in effect. If we are unable to access the credit or capital markets in the longer term, on commercially reasonable terms or at all, our ability to carry out growth and business development initiatives would be limited, thereby potentially limiting our future growth opportunities. We also carry significant intangible assets on our balance sheet. As of March 28, 2021, the intangible assets on our balance sheet totaled £1,937.9 million, including £938.5 million in goodwill relating to the CA Acquisition. Pursuant to current accounting rules, we are required to assess goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators are present. Impairment indicators include, but are not limited to, significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results and negative industry or economic trends. If such events were to occur, the carrying amount of our goodwill and other intangible assets may no longer be recoverable and we would be required to record an impairment charge. The COVID 19 pandemic and its impact on our business initially constituted an impairment indicator that we assessed and, accordingly, we recognized an exceptional goodwill impairment of £266.4 million in the 42-week period ended March 29, 2020. The impairment charge represented a change in the timing of vehicle volumes and associated discounted cash flows, which were expected through the Marketplace over the short term as economic activity recovers. See “Summary—Recent _Developments—Impact of COVID 19—Impairment Review” and “Operating and Financial Review—Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations—COVID 19—Impairment Review.”_ As a matter of ordinary business operations, we are subject to potential credit risk related to our buyer finance services, BCA Partner Finance. The negative economic impact of the COVID 19 pandemic may increase such risk. While we maintain a well-established credit scoring matrix it cannot be assured that buyers repay their debt owed to us on a widespread and systemic basis over an extended period of time. We have participated in available government schemes designed to support businesses negatively impacted by the COVID 19 pandemic. These schemes include mechanisms to allow companies to place employees on paid leave or on reduced working hours, with the difference to an employee’s ordinary salary being partially reimbursed by the respective government. In the UK, we have furloughed as much as 80% of our staff at the peak of the COVID 19 pandemic in April 2020, such number subsequently dropping below 60% by June 2020, and as of March 28, 2021, approximately 4% of our employees remained on short-term work. In addition, we have also applied for and made use of employee salary support schemes introduced by certain governments in the UK and continental Europe. While we are carefully tailoring our use of these COVID 19 prompted measures to ensure retention of the necessary knowledge and expertise to support the business going forward, as a result of these measures, there could be a loss of institutional knowledge, experience, and/or expertise which could limit our ability to manage the business effectively, react to external developments, retain vendors and make necessary technological developments. Similarly, these measures may negatively impact the morale of our workforce, leading to voluntary departures of additional employees. In addition, there can be no guarantee that similar schemes will be available in the future in the event of further COVID 19 or similar public health related disruption. In the event of future disruption and in the absence of similar support schemes, related costs may be significantly higher than experienced during the previous periods of COVID 19 restrictions with a negative impact on our ability to operate. The overall impact of the COVID 19 pandemic on our business remains uncertain and will ultimately depend on a number of factors that cannot be accurately predicted at this time. These factors include, but are not limited to, the duration (including the extent of any resurgence in the future) and the ultimate severity of the COVID 19 pandemic, the timing of and manner in which containment efforts are reduced or lifted and the ----- length of time it takes for normal economic and operating conditions to resume, which are all beyond our knowledge and control. Moreover, there are no comparable recent events that provide us with guidance. For these reasons, we cannot reasonably estimate the impact of the COVID 19 pandemic on our business with any certainty nor can we provide any assurance that the COVID 19 pandemic will not continue to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. To the extent the COVID 19 pandemic continues to adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, it may also have the effect of heightening other risks described in this section of this Offering Memorandum entitled “Risk Factors,” including those relating to our high level of indebtedness, our ability to generate sufficient cash flows to service our indebtedness, and our ability to comply with the covenants contained in the agreements that govern our indebtedness, including the indenture governing the Notes. In addition, as a consequence of the significantly increased volatility and instability experienced during periods of challenging macroeconomic conditions, it is difficult for us to forecast demand trends. We may be unable to accurately predict the extent or duration of cycles or their effect on our financial condition or result of operations and can give no assurance as to the timing, extent or duration of the current or future macroeconomic cycles. A decline in demand due to adverse macroeconomic conditions may also have an adverse impact on the business of the automotive industry and require us to substantially increase the amounts of financial assistance, to carry on our operations.

Does the text mention that the company is exposed to risks associated with cyclical products?

    Title: We are exposed to general economic, political and regulatory conditions and risks in the countries in which we have operations and customers.
    Text: We operate in the UK and in a number of continental European countries while selling vehicles to buyers in a wider geographic area. Consequently, our business and financial results are affected, directly and indirectly, by global economic conditions, such as instability in credit markets, declining consumer and business confidence, interest rates, volatile exchange rates, and other challenges such as uncertain or changing political or regulatory environments. A potential prolonged economic slowdown in the UK and continental Europe resulting from the COVID 19 pandemic poses a risk to our customers, our suppliers, our employees and the communities in which they and we operate. The current status of the COVID 19 pandemic around the world remains serious, and while there is cause for optimism (with the continuing progress on vaccinations across European countries and the UK in particular), there can be no assurance that vaccinations are effective and reopening will not be reversed in response to a resurgence in COVID 19 outbreaks. Negative economic developments, including due to global or local recessions, higher unemployment rates, diminished levels of consumer confidence, declines in income levels and the loss of wealth, have resulted in the past, and may result in the future, in decreased demand in the automotive industry. The ongoing COVID 19 pandemic may be associated with further or continued decline in economic activity and increase in unemployment levels which may negatively impact the demand for vehicles from consumers and business users. Since we rely on strong demand for the used vehicle market, we are particularly dependent on consumer confidence and spending power, two factors that are strongly influenced by overall economic conditions. Moreover, national and local governments may impose limitations and restrictions on the operation of our business in response to any future COVID 19 resurgence, and the impact of those restrictions may have a detrimental effect on our ability to operate (including but not limited to social distancing and other health and safety related measures, and possibly preventing or restricting some elements of our business from trading at all). Compliance with such regulations requires the application of financial and human resources and increases costs to the potential detriment of our business. Failure by us to comply, or the perception of non-compliance, with any such regulations may lead to enforcement action against us with possible financial costs and could also damage our brands and reputation. Although the used vehicle market has some countercyclical characteristics, adverse economic conditions in the countries where we have operations may negatively impact our financial results, and that of our vendors and buyers. Activity levels in the automotive industry can be affected by such factors as the availability of consumer credit, the growth of average wages and the level of unemployment, among others, which in turn could impact the volume of vehicles we handle. In addition, if OEMs in the UK were to experience declining new vehicles sales, the used vehicle market could in turn be negatively impacted, which would affect our Vehicle Buying division and Vehicle Remarketing division. Due to the relative size of our UK operations, compared to our operations in continental Europe, we are more exposed to changes in the UK economic environment. ----- The wider geopolitical environment in the UK and continental Europe is also beyond our control. Our business and operations are adversely affected by unstable or deteriorating international trade conditions. For example, the withdrawal of the UK from the EU effective December 31, 2020 (commonly referred to as “Brexit”) have resulted in substantial regulatory uncertainty regarding international trade and trade policy. Moreover, our international operations are subject to risks associated with the prevailing local political, economic and regulatory climate. For instance, it may be more difficult in certain jurisdictions for us to enforce contracts, collect receivables, terminate labor contracts, receive dividends and transfer funds. In addition, we may face risks associated with unexpected changes in the regulatory environment, particularly in relation to complexity of domestic and international customs and tariffs, potentially adverse tax consequences, restrictions on foreign trade or investment, currency exchange and capital controls, nationalization and expropriation and cancelation of our contractual relationships without full compensation for loss. Any of the aforementioned changes to general economic, political and regulatory conditions, and in particular any changes in the regulatory environment and potentially adverse tax consequences as a result thereof, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.

Does the text mention that the company is exposed to risks associated with cyclical products?

    Title: We are dependent on the supply of vehicles to the Marketplace.
    Text: Our business is vulnerable to fluctuations in the supply of vehicles to our sales platforms, including our digital and physical auction sites (together, the “Marketplace”), which in turn depends on a variety of factors. For example, declines in demand in the automotive industry resulting from adverse macroeconomic conditions have historically adversely impacted used vehicle trade-ins to dealers, which has in turn reduced our auction volumes, as dealers represent a large proportion of our vendors. In addition, the supply of vehicles from corporate vendors, including contract hire, leasing and finance companies, can also be affected by adverse economic conditions if corporate vendors reduce the size of, or delay the renewal of, their fleets during an economic downturn. OEMs have also in the past reduced the number of vehicles manufactured during periods of macroeconomic decline, which, over time, can adversely affect the number of used vehicles in the market and thus the supply of vehicles to the Marketplace. Additionally, legislative and regulatory changes could adversely affect the supply of vehicles to the Marketplace. Furthermore, the supply of vehicles could also decrease if our vendors elect to sell their vehicles directly to our buyers, including private consumers. If, as a result of the foregoing factors or for any other reason, the supply of vehicles to the Marketplace declines, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Furthermore, our ability to provide a large, attractive offering of used vehicles within our Vehicle Remarketing division depends on the number and quality of used vehicles we are able to purchase through WeBuyAnyCar, and the public’s willingness to tender their vehicles to our Vehicle Buying division. There can be no assurance that the supply of suitable vehicles at competitive prices will be sufficient to meet our needs and to continue to grow our offering. In addition, difficulties in sourcing a suitable inventory of used vehicles may arise, among others, due to errors from the proprietary pricing model we use to calculate purchase prices within WeBuyAnyCar, or a failure to adjust our pricing model in order to meet the most recent market trends. If we are unable to source a suitable inventory at competitive prices as a result of any of these factors, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.

Does the text mention that the company is exposed to risks associated with cyclical products?

    Title: We depend on a limited number of vendors for a substantial portion of the vehicles we sell.
    Text: Historically, a limited number of vendors have collectively accounted for a substantial portion of the vehicles sold through the Marketplace, notwithstanding the fact that WeBuyAnyCar (which sources vehicles from individual consumers) contributed 35% of all vehicles we remarketed in the 52-week period ended March 28, 2021, thereby partially de-risking our supply. The majority of sales arrangements with our vendors do not guarantee the provision of a minimum number of vehicles to us. Accordingly, we cannot give any assurance that our largest vendors will continue to provide us with a supply of vehicles, or that we would be able to replace the volumes of vehicles provided by these vendors were they to materially decrease. In addition, if one or more of our vendors’ financial condition deteriorates, or if a vendor were to restructure its operations, our loss of access to the vendor’s vehicles could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.

    Title: Our business is vulnerable to declines in demand for used vehicles.
    Text: If the demand for new or used vehicles decreases in the markets in which we operate, the volumes of, and the prices paid for, vehicles sold through the Marketplace may decrease, which in turn could reduce our margins. Although the used vehicle market has some countercyclical characteristics, no assurance can be given that ----- such market remains stable in times of economic downturn. A decline in demand from our buyers could be caused by a variety of factors, including adverse changes in macroeconomic conditions, such as stagnant growth, a decline in disposable income or consumer confidence and restricted access to consumer financing. High fuel prices may also disproportionately affect demand for vehicles with poor fuel-efficiency and lead to a reduction in the miles driven per vehicle, which could affect the number of vehicles sold through the Marketplace. Additionally, rising interest rates may depress sales of new or used vehicles because many purchasers finance their purchases. Furthermore, adverse changes in the credit quality of our buyers, arising from macroeconomic conditions or otherwise, could also lead to lower sales, as well as increase our counterparty risk. Any reduction in demand for used vehicles caused by these or any other reason could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.

Does the text mention that the company is exposed to risks associated with cyclical products?

    Title: We may be adversely affected by a general decline in vehicle ownership or sudden changes in demand for certain types of used vehicles.
    Text: Demand for our used vehicles may be adversely affected by trends that lead to an overall decline in demand for vehicles. For example, environmental concerns surrounding certain types of vehicle (older diesel vehicles, for example) or a growing share of younger people choosing not to purchase or lease their own vehicles, opting for ride-hailing services, ride-sharing services, car rental services and public transportation instead. These trends may continue or even intensify, in particular as urbanization continues and a growing share of the population migrates to major cities. As a result, overall demand for vehicles, including for used vehicles, may decline, which could adversely affect our business prospects. Furthermore, demand for certain types of used vehicles may suddenly decline due to the introduction of innovative technologies for new vehicles (e.g., autonomous driving systems). There is no guarantee that we will be able to quickly source more innovative vehicles as it may take several years before they become available in the used vehicle market. Consequently, sourcing and selling such vehicles may be more complex. Likewise, actions by OEMs or car dealers may have a significant impact on demand in the used vehicle market. If these parties decide to offer greater incentives for the sale of new vehicles (e.g., discounts or attractive financing), or generally lower prices for new vehicles, this could make buying a new vehicle more attractive. As a result, prices for used vehicles and our associated fees may decline. Prices may also decline due to insolvencies of rental car companies or other companies with large fleets or an increased number of returns of leased vehicles, which could result in oversupply. Conversely, any significant increase in market prices due to a scarcity of used vehicles could impact our ability to source desirable inventory at acceptable prices and our volume turnaround, which could have a material adverse effect on our continued growth and margins.

    Title: We face competition and may not be able to successfully adapt to industry changes.
    Text: Across each of our divisions, we face competition from other market participants (both established and new entrants). The Vehicle Buying division and the Vehicle Remarketing division face competition from other vehicle buying and remarketing companies both in the UK and continental Europe. In the Automotive Services division, we face competition from a broad range of competitors. Due to the increasing use of the Internet and other technology as remarketing and distribution channels, we also face increasing competition from online wholesale and retail vehicle selling platforms as well as from our own vendors when they sell directly to end consumers rather than remarket vehicles through the Marketplace. Increased competition could result in reduced profitability and/or loss of market share. Our future success may be impacted by our ability to respond to evolving industry trends, changes in buyer and vendor requirements and new technologies. Furthermore, some of our competitors may have greater financial and marketing resources, may be able to respond more quickly to evolving industry dynamics and changes in vendor or buyer requirements or may be able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of new or emerging services and technologies. If we are unable to compete successfully or to successfully adapt to industry changes, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.

    Title: A disruption in supply chains may adversely affect our Vehicle Remarketing division and Automotive Services division.
    Text: Our Vehicle Remarketing division and Automotive Services division offer a wide range of non-auction services, such as inspection, appraisal, repair and refurbishment, storage and handling. These services expose us to supply chain risks, as we are dependent on the availability of certain automotive parts and skilled labor ----- to ensure that vehicles can move seamlessly along the automotive value chain, from collection through inspection, repairs and onwards sale. Any reduction, or any delays or disruptions, in the supply chains of the materials and components used by our Vehicle Remarketing division or Automotive Services division could result in a significant disruption to our operations and affect our ability to meet our commitments. Similarly, the lack of skilled labor to undertake inspection, appraisal, repair and refurbishment, storage as well as handling services could result in a significant disruption to our operations. These disruptions may result from many reasons, including increasing demands for certain automotive parts, closures of suppliers’ plants or critical manufacturing lines due to strikes, mechanical failures or breakdowns, electrical outages, fire, explosions, political upheaval, competition for skilled labor as well as logistical complications resulting from severe weather or other natural disasters and delayed customs processing. Financial difficulties of our major suppliers may also lead to delays in the delivery of materials and components. The unavailability of any automotive parts or skilled labor required to deliver our inspection, appraisal, repair and refurbishment, storage and handling services could cause our Vehicle Remarketing division and Automotive Services division to incur significant delays. The risk of disruptions in the supply of materials and components that we use is heightened due to the greater political, economic and social instability created by Brexit, which may lead to further complications with respect to customs processing and/or may lead to limited transportation infrastructure and difficulties in finding alternative reliable, costefficient and qualified suppliers that can freely move between the UK and continental Europe. Brexit and the related restrictions on free movement of labor across the English Channel has also heightened the risk that skilled labor may be unavailable. See “—We are exposed to general economic, political and regulatory conditions _and risks in the countries in which we have operations and customers.”_

    Title: Our business is dependent on certain information and technology systems, and the failure to effectively maintain, protect, develop or update these systems or cyber security attacks could have a negative impact on our business.
    Text: Our business and financial performance depend on the effective operation of our information and technology systems, increasingly including our cloud-hosted and digital selling platforms. It is therefore essential that key systems, software and hardware are operational at all times. Substantially all of our remarketing buyers access our systems via websites and/or mobile applications to view vehicles coming to auction prior to participating in our auctions, and to participate in the various types of auctions and Bid Now/Buy Now sales themselves. In addition, our customers also use WeBuyAnyCar’s online vehicle pricing quotation system to obtain a valuation of their vehicle. We are therefore reliant on the operation of WeBuyAnyCar’s online platform, as well as a number of mobile applications, which offer vehicle search functions, bidding features and access to live information such as pricing, vehicle condition, and individual lot/auction timings. Our digital services are accessed by a large number of users, often at the same time, and if user traffic increases, we may not be able to scale our technology to accommodate increased capacity requirements, which may result in interruptions or delays in service. The business is also reliant on the systems that power the Automotive Services division’s remote operations, such as transporters, inspect and collect operatives, appraisers and imaging. We rely on a large range of computer and other information systems which are essential to our operations and which became even more important during the COVID 19 pandemic, when our operating model shifted towards an online business. Accordingly, the continued and uninterrupted performance of those systems, along with their development and implementation, are vital factors in the operation of our business. We depend on our technical infrastructure for all aspects of the day-to-day management of our business and the delivery of our services. Any material disruption to the operation of such infrastructure, including as a result of legislative and regulatory changes regarding online sales and e-commerce, may materially and negatively affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. Interruptions in these systems, whether due to system failures, computer viruses, software errors or physical or electronic break-ins, or other factors could affect the security or availability of our products and services on our websites or mobile applications and prevent or inhibit the ability of vendors and buyers to access our services. Electronic break-ins and cyber security attacks continue to increase in both prevalence and sophistication throughout the digital world with the potential to corrupt, affect or destroy key systems and data, including the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our data and systems. Given that techniques used in these break-ins and attacks change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, it may be impossible to properly secure our systems. In addition, technical advances or a continued expansion and increased complexity of our digital offering could increase the likelihood of security breaches. The risk of electronic break-ins and cyber security attacks includes breaches and attempted breaches not only of our own products, services and systems, but also of those of our customers, employees, contractors, business partners, and other third parties as well as of third-party systems on which we rely to operate our digital platforms. ----- Successful breaches, employee malfeasance, or human or technological error could result in, for example, unauthorized access to, disclosure, modification, misuse, loss, or destruction of our data or systems or those of our customers or other third parties, theft of sensitive, regulated, or confidential data including personal information and intellectual property, loss of access to critical data or systems through ransomware, destructive attacks or other means, and business delays, service or system disruptions or denials of service. In addition, the fast-paced, evolving, pervasive and sophisticated nature of certain cyber threats and vulnerabilities, as well as the scale and complexity of the business and infrastructure, make it possible that certain threats or vulnerabilities will be undetected or unmitigated in time to prevent an attack on one of our customers and its customers. Furthermore, these risks will increase as we continue to shift of our operating model towards an online business in response to the COVID 19 pandemic. Problems with the reliability, availability or security of our systems and digital service offerings could harm our reputation, result in a loss of vendors or buyers or necessitate additional costs, fines or penalties, any of which could harm our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. Certain vendors, as a condition of operating through us, audit our information and technology systems. These audits may require significant management time to address and could result in costly changes to information and technology systems as a condition of continued operation. The loss of the supply of vehicles from a vendor or the cost of changes to our information and technology systems following an audit could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. Robust back office systems, including auction information systems, are also critical to our ability to attract visitors to our websites. These systems are also imperative for the operation of our website and mobile applications, pricing, third-party data feeds, customer service, internal and external communications, procurement, logistics, administration and financial reporting. In addition, we are dependent on certain third-party information and technology systems, particularly with respect to payment processing, vehicle licensing checks and fraud detection. In particular, we face liability risks in connection with online credit card fraud and problems adequately securing our payment systems, despite using market-standard protocols designed to ensure enhanced security and strong identification for our customers when they use their debit or credit cards for vehicle purchases. The failure or unavailability of any of our information and technology systems to detect such type of fraud or other errors with respect to payment processing or vehicle licensing checks could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. Much of our physical information and technology infrastructure (including servers, website hosting, database storage and wide area networks) is supplied by service providers via managed services contracts. Technical or other service problems faced by our managed service providers could adversely affect the experience of our vendors and buyers. Any financial or operational difficulties faced by our managed service providers or any of the third-party service providers with whom they contract may have adverse effects on our business, the nature and extent of which are difficult to predict. Furthermore, any disruption of the distribution channels or networks used by our mobile applications could adversely affect the ability to access or update our mobile applications, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. Our success also depends on our continued innovation and ability to provide features that make our websites and mobile applications user-friendly, particularly through the development of specific software and applications under a variety of new platforms and operating systems, which are generally expected by users to offer the same features or flexibility and to be as easily and intuitively operated as desktop interfaces. As technology improves and as our operations grow in size, scope and complexity, we will need to improve and upgrade our systems and infrastructure, which may require substantial financial, operational and technical resources. Delays or difficulties in implementing new or enhanced systems may impair our ability to provide digital services to our vendors and buyers or may reduce the effectiveness of digital auctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.

    Title: Acceptance of our digital platforms and mobile applications as suitable platforms for the sale and purchase of used vehicles may decrease or fail to improve.
    Text: The restrictions on physical sales activity (including physical auctions) due to the COVID 19 pandemic has significantly increased the volume of vehicles traded digitally across the used vehicle market and via the Marketplace. While the acceptance of our digital platforms has been strong by both buyers and vendors, there is no guarantee that overall online acceptance in the used vehicle market will be maintained or increased. If the acceptance of our digital offering decreases or fails to grow, we may not be able to achieve the future growth we target. -----

    Title: Our inventory and vehicles held on behalf of others may be damaged by extreme weather or other events outside our control, and the insurance we carry may be inadequate.
    Text: During the handling of new and used vehicles across the business, large numbers of vehicles are transported and stored by us in both covered and open-air facilities. We are liable for the vehicles we own (the majority of which are purchased through the Vehicle Buying division) and, in many cases, we are liable for the vehicles supplied by vendors for auction through the Vehicle Remarketing division, as well as when we collect and deliver vehicles through our logistics services. Extreme weather, such as hail storms, fire and flooding, which has in the past damaged vehicles in our possession, natural disasters (such as extreme precipitation or extreme temperature) or other catastrophic events (such as terrorism and large-scale accidents) may adversely affect our physical facilities or damage vehicles awaiting sale or vehicles generally stored by us. Such risks are particularly prevalent in respect of our open air facilities. In addition, there is no assurance that used vehicles in our inventory will be properly protected (e.g., against theft or vandalism). This may result in an increase in costs, delay or cancelation of auction sales, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our revenue and profitability. Our failure to meet vendors’ or buyers’ demands in such situations could further adversely affect our reputation, reduce customer satisfaction, damage relationships with both vendors and buyers and result in a loss of future business. We maintain insurance cover for risks including property damage, business interruption, employers and public liability, as well as for certain other claims consistent with customary practice in the industry in which we operate. However, claims not covered by our insurance or in excess of our insurance coverage may arise, such as from a natural disaster, theft or other causes outside our control. Moreover, we may be unable in future periods to obtain insurance coverage on acceptable terms, without substantial premiums increase or at all, particularly if there is deterioration in our claim experience history. A successful claim against us, which is not covered by or in excess of our coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.

    Title: We are subject to complex taxation in multiple jurisdictions, in particular relating to valued-added taxes.
    Text: We are subject to taxation in multiple jurisdictions, including in the UK and continental Europe. Because of the complex interplay between our business and the various taxation regimes to which we are subject, the provision made for taxes in the accounts involves a significant amount of judgement and uncertainty regarding the interpretation of relevant facts and laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Changes to existing tax laws or tax reporting obligations, or the introduction of new tax laws or obligations (for instance with regards to online sales), in any of these jurisdictions could adversely impact our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. The risks associated to unforeseen changes to existing tax laws or tax reporting obligations are compounded by the uncertainty created by Brexit and legislatives changes in connection thereto (see “—We are exposed to general economic, political and regulatory conditions and risks in _the countries in which we have operations and customers”) and the shift of our operating model towards an_ online business in response to the COVID 19 pandemic (see “—The COVID 19 pandemic has had, and will _continue to have, a significant adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition, operating results and liquidity, and the ultimate outcome of the COVID 19 pandemic is uncertain”)._ Additionally, we are subject to complex laws and regulations in many countries involving VAT and other indirect taxes. In the jurisdictions in which we operate, we are responsible for collecting any VAT amounts due on the vehicles we sell, and we rely on our vendors to provide accurate and complete information relating to the VAT status of each vehicle to enable us to calculate the amount of any VAT due. We also rely on purchasers of our vehicles at auction to provide accurate information regarding their residency in order to assess appropriate treatment of VAT for sales invoices. If a vendor or buyer provides incorrect or incomplete VATrelated information, or if we fail to implement or fully comply with local VAT rules and regulations, we may be exposed to VAT claims and fines from relevant authorities. In the ordinary course of our business, we are frequently subject to VAT and other tax audits by relevant authorities throughout Europe, and these audits can relate to matters that arose many years in the past. The outcome of these audits could result in additional VAT claims and/or regulatory actions against us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.

    Title: We may not successfully implement our strategic initiatives.
    Text: Our future operating results are dependent, in part, on our success in implementing our strategic and tactical initiatives. These initiatives are focused on enhancing our competitive advantage as an integrated end-to-end ----- service provider, further expanding internationally, strengthening our infrastructure and logistics network, capitalizing on favorable industry trends, continuing to enhance our data capabilities and improving our operational efficiencies, cash flow and leverage. These initiatives will require extensive planning and management attention and entail substantial execution risk. Notably, our strategy is focused on meaningful growth of vehicle volumes transaction through our marketplaces. Such volume growth requires simultaneous success in several different domains including: (i) commercial success with vendors, so they supply higher volume to our marketplaces; (ii) maintained data leadership in order for the marketplaces to provide efficient liquidity to all participants; (iii) digital product leadership to make our integrated services offering the most relevant in the market; and (iv) best-in-class logistics and services footprint to deliver an integrated end-to-end digital and physical service. Failure to maintain our competitive advantages in any of these dimension could have a material could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, new digital platforms will also require substantial IT support and infrastructure and, as we grow, we will need to ensure our back-office IT systems are integrated across our operations. With respect to the Vehicle Buying division, our strategy places particular importance on expanding WeBuyAnyCar’s operations. However, there can be no assurance that WeBuyAnyCar will continue to grow in the UK. As we seek to expand car buying into new markets, we may also need to comply with unfamiliar regulatory regimes. In addition, because car buying involves purchasing vehicles and holding them as inventory until their sale (in contrast to our UK Vehicle Remarketing division and our International Vehicle Remarketing division, which do not include WeBuyAnyCar’s operations, and do not take title to the majority of vehicles that they sell), the expansion of such operations may increase our cash requirements and inventory risk, thereby increasing our depreciation and impairment charges. Similarly, recalls by OEMs are a common occurrence and have accelerated in frequency and scope in recent years. In case of such recalls, we may have to temporarily remove the affected used vehicles from our inventory and may be unable to liquidate such inventory in a timely manner or at all. The same may occur if regulatory changes (e.g., the introduction of stricter emission standards) prevent consumers from driving certain used vehicles in cities or at all, consequently reducing demand for the affected vehicles. If we are unable to sell the vehicles purchased at an appropriate price, or at all, we may incur write-downs or our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. In addition, the implementation of our strategic initiatives in certain international markets may not produce the benefits achieved in markets where we already have established operations. Each new market that we enter will require us to address the particular economic, currency, political and regulatory risks associated with that new market, which may entail finding new partners, hiring and training new staff with local language skills and an understanding of the local market, and learning the customs and cultures of the new country. These processes can be difficult, costly and divert management and personnel resources. Additionally, our business strategies may change from time to time, which could delay our ability to implement initiatives that we believe are important to our business. Our inability to successfully implement our strategic initiatives could result in, among others, the loss of clients and personnel, the loss of market share, the impairment of assets and inefficiencies from operating in new markets, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.

    Title: We may be unable to successfully identify and acquire or integrate future acquisitions into our business.
    Text: Our growth has been, in part, attributable to the acquisition of other businesses, and we may continue to expand our business through acquisitions and other business combinations in the future. The success of our acquisition strategy will depend on our ability to identify suitable acquisition candidates, to assess the value, strengths, weaknesses, contingent or other liabilities and potential profitability of acquisition candidates, to negotiate acceptable purchase terms, to obtain any necessary permits or approvals and to integrate the operations of such businesses, once acquired. Successful integration of future acquisitions will depend on our ability to effect any necessary changes in operations or personnel resulting from the acquisition. Acquisitions may also expose us to new risks, including difficulties in integrating and operating businesses in countries that are new to us, difficulties integrating acquired businesses in a cost-effective manner, unforeseen legal, regulatory, contractual, employment or other issues or expenses arising out of an acquisition, potential disruptions to our ongoing business caused by acquisitions, including pressure on management’s time and resources, or an acquired business’ failure to meet our expectations or business plans. The occurrence of any ----- of these risks could have an adverse impact on our ability to make acquisitions and may limit our growth, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.

    Title: We may not be able to provide financing in order to offer stock funding (trade finance) to registered dealers through BCA Partner Finance or to repossess the financed vehicles serving as collateral.
    Text: To support the attractiveness of our offering, we seek to help certain registered dealers in the UK by offering stock funding (trade finance). To this end, we have entered into a £220 million non-recourse receivables facility (the “Receivables Facility”) with a syndicate of banks, who provide the liquidity to support our BCA Partner Finance business, of which £148.3 million was drawn as of March 28, 2021. If these banks are no longer willing to provide financing to us or only grant such financing on disadvantageous terms, we may not be able to offer attractive financing options to registered dealers. As a result, demand for our used vehicles may suffer and we may not be able to grow our business as envisaged. In addition, we use our sold vehicles as security when offering stock funding (trade finance) and cooperate with third-party collection agents to repossess such vehicles, should registered dealers default on their obligations. We may, however, not be able to locate the relevant vehicles and successfully repossess them (e.g., if they are transported outside the UK). Furthermore, the residual value of the repossessed vehicles may be lower than anticipated (e.g., if they are involved in accidents), and we may not be able to take recourse against the relevant car dealer. As a result, we may incur significant losses even where we use sold vehicles as security for BCA Partner Finance. See “Business—Operations—Value-Added Services—Post-auction Services.”

    Title: We may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights.
    Text: Our intellectual property rights include proprietary technology and software relating to digital auction systems as well as trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights and other intellectual property. Our increased reliance in recent years on proprietary Internet-based programs and technology have increased the relative importance of intellectual property assets to our business. Our business and IT systems and other key proprietary intellectual property generally are not protected by patents or registered design rights. As a result, we are particularly reliant on trademarks, copyright, database rights, registered domain names and the law protecting confidential information to protect our brands, technologies, software and databases. Although we have taken steps to reduce these risks, these steps may be inadequate. Effective intellectual property protection also may not be available in every country in which our services are offered, deployed or made available. Any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights or any inability to protect our intellectual property rights could have an adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, we may be required to spend significant funds on monitoring and protecting our intellectual property rights and we may not be able to discover all infringements, misappropriations or other violations of our intellectual property. If we initiate litigation against infringements of our intellectual property, such litigation may prove costly and there is no guarantee that it will ultimately be successful and that the rulings we obtain will adequately remedy the damage we have suffered. In addition, we provide certain information to third-party service providers who help us assess the performance of our business (e.g., Google Analytics). Consequently, we only have limited control to ensure that such information is not misused by such service providers or passed on to third parties, including our competitors.

    Title: We may be accused of infringing on the intellectual property of third parties.
    Text: As we utilize a variety of intellectual property for our business, vendors, regulatory authorities or other third parties may allege that we infringe on their intellectual property, and we may therefore become subject to allegations and litigation against us. Even unfounded allegations of infringement may adversely affect our reputation and business and may require significant resources to defend against. If we try to obtain licenses from such third parties to settle these disputes, there is no guarantee that such licenses will be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all, in which case we may be required to alter our brands and change the way we operate. Furthermore, some of the agreements we enter into with third parties may contain clauses regarding the protection of their intellectual property licensed to us. A violation of these clauses (e.g., the unauthorized sub-licensing or disclosure of a confidential source code) may require us to pay significant penalties, prevent us from utilizing such intellectual property in the future and result in litigation against us. In addition, some of our proprietary technology was developed on the basis of proprietary and non-proprietary software licensed from third parties. If these licenses were to be challenged or found invalid through litigation or other ----- proceedings, we may not be able to continue to utilize such proprietary technology. In addition, the licensors or other third parties may claim that the use of such technology is outside the scope of the relevant license and therefore infringes upon their intellectual property.

    Title: We may be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations, in particular those governing the trading of used vehicles and the automotive industry in general.
    Text: We are required to comply with a wide range of laws and regulations relating to, among other things, the purchase and sale of used vehicles, the state of such vehicles, the use of the internet, online payments, consumer protection, data protection as well as road traffic, environmental, planning and employment matters, and the application of such laws and regulations by local authorities may vary. We may face risks associated with unexpected changes in the regulatory environment, particularly in relation to complexity of domestic and international customs and tariffs, potentially adverse tax consequences, restrictions on foreign trade or investment, currency exchange and capital controls, nationalization and expropriation and cancelation of our contractual relationships without full compensation for loss. Any changes in the laws and regulations, applicable to our business and operations, including used vehicles in our inventory, as well as the Marketplace, or changes to the application and interpretation of such laws and regulations by authorities and courts, may adversely affect our operations (such as the supply of vehicles) or may give rise to substantial compliance costs, adjustment expenses and other costs as well as fines in connection with our business activities, or prevent us from executing our strategy as planned. Even legislative initiatives and the corresponding public debates could result in significant uncertainty, regardless of whether such initiatives ultimately become law. We must comply with such regulations to the extent they are applicable to us as noncompliance could lead to the imposition of fines or other sanctions.

    Title: Our failure to prevent unauthorized access to personal data or otherwise process personal data in accordance with applicable data protection laws could result in legal liability for, and reputational harm.
    Text: We process and store personal data as part of our business, including in relation to our employees, vendors and buyers. Strict data protection laws exist in both the UK and throughout continental Europe. These data protection laws require us to ensure an appropriate level of security of personal data, having regard to the possibility of damage to and the nature of the data. Failure to take appropriate information security measures could result in personal data being processed in an unauthorized or potentially unlawful manner. The General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) (the “GDPR”) and the UK Data Protection Act 2018 significantly change the data protection landscape in the EU and the UK. Such laws and regulations strengthen the rights of individuals (data subjects), impose stricter controls over the processing of personal data by both controllers and processors of personal data and impose stricter sanctions with substantial administrative fines and potential claims for damages from data subjects for breach of their rights. The GDPR also offers data subjects the option to allow privacy organizations to litigate on their behalf, including collecting potential damages, which may result in a substantial increase in claims being brought. Should a serious data breach occur, the GDPR provides for increased obligations to notify regulators and data subjects whose personal data has been compromised and may result in the imposition of significant sanctions and penalties, which will require heightened escalation and notification processes with associated response plans. Complying with all relevant data protection laws and regulation is relatively complex. We, or the entities or businesses acquired by us, may have entered in the past or may enter in the future into employment agreements or other types of material contracts that may not be compliant with applicable data protection laws and regulations. Moreover, our customers frequently require that we demonstrate our compliance with data protection laws as they deem appropriate with respect to any personal data we may process on their behalf. Failure to demonstrate such compliance to their satisfaction may result in action including, but not limited to, the loss of contracts with such customers. The failure to comply with our obligations under applicable data protection laws could potentially result in us being issued with undertakings, enforcement notices (the failure with which to comply would be a criminal offence) and fines, as well as suffer damage to our brand and reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.

Does the text mention that the company is exposed to risks associated with cyclical products?

    Title: We are subject to a variety of laws and regulations across the jurisdictions in which we operate, some of which are unsettled and still developing.
    Text: Our operations are subject to compliance with extensive laws and regulations, both in the UK and across continental Europe, including, but not limited to, laws relating to vehicle brokerages and auctions, currency ----- reporting obligations, data protection, competition, consumer protection, advertising, the Internet, property usage, money laundering, bribery and taxation. A failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions, liability to third parties, license revocation and reputational damage, which in turn could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business as well as our profitability. Furthermore, if laws and regulations are not enforced equally against our competitors in a particular market, our compliance with laws and regulations may put us at a competitive disadvantage vis-à-vis non-complying competitors. Changes in laws or regulations or the adoption of new laws and regulations applicable to us may also increase the costs of providing services or limit our ability to expand our service offerings, any of which could adversely impact our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. More stringent laws or regulations may impose additional burdens on us, and it is difficult to predict the impact of new or amended laws or regulations to which we may become subject. There is, and will likely continue to be, an increasing number of laws, regulations and court decisions pertaining to the Internet and online commerce, which may relate to liability for information retrieved from or transmitted over the Internet. For example, in certain jurisdictions where we operate, local regulations impose restrictions on or prohibit credit and debit card operations in order to protect the privacy and security of personal information that is collected, processed and transmitted in or from the governing jurisdiction. The growth and development of online commerce has also prompted calls for more stringent consumer protection laws and more aggressive enforcement efforts by regulatory authorities that may impose additional burdens on online businesses generally. Because of our relatively large physical property portfolio, we are also subject to the risk that we could be compelled by government authorities to sell or vacate the property on which we operate or to make significant changes to the operations and activities we undertake to comply with changes to planning regulations. Furthermore, because of our international operations, the various regulatory regimes to which we are subject may conflict so that compliance with the regulatory requirements in one jurisdiction may create regulatory issues in another, thereby making compliance more difficult and increasing the costs of conducting our business. In addition, if we were to expand into new countries, we could face legal, regulatory or tax requirements with which we are not familiar. Compliance with current or future laws and regulations to which we are subject could place significant demands on our resources, as well as subject us to unforeseen and potentially adverse legal, regulatory or tax consequences, which could adversely impact our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.

Does the text mention that the company is exposed to risks associated with cyclical products?

    Title: Our costs could materially increase.
    Text: Our largest cost is payroll, driven primarily by the number of our employees and their wages and salaries. If relationships with our employees were to deteriorate, we could experience strikes, unionization efforts or other types of conflicts, which could lead to interruption to our operations and increased costs. In addition, payroll costs could increase because we compete with other service providers to recruit and retain skilled employees, which has become more challenging as a result of Brexit and the related restrictions on free movement of labor across the English Channel. High employment levels can lead to scarcity of staff and a corresponding increase in the wages and salaries necessary to attract and retain suitable employees may be indispensable in the future. In addition, future legislative changes relating to the minimum wage could necessitate an increase in payroll costs. We also undertake significant marketing activities, in particular for our Vehicle Buying division, and any increase in television, radio and Internet advertising rates could increase our operating expenses. Moreover, we incur significant fuel, power and other consumable supply costs across our operations that may escalate and there can be no assurance that our costs will not grow at a faster rate than our revenue. If we are unable to pass on future cost increases to our vendors or buyers, our operating profit margin could be adversely affected, which could adversely impact our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.

    Title: We rely on the strength of our brands, and the costs of maintaining and enhancing our brand awareness may increase.
    Text: Our brands, corporate image and reputation constitute a significant part of our value proposition. Our success over the years has largely depended on our ability to develop our brands and corporate image as a leading vehicle auction company in the UK and continental Europe. In addition, the WeBuyAnyCar consumer brand in the UK is particularly important to the Vehicle Buying division, and the development of the WeBuyAnyCar brand historically has required significant financial expenditure, particularly on marketing and advertising. ----- In order to maintain WeBuyAnyCar’s reputation, we have to be able to respond to changes in marketing and advertising rules, consumer sentiment and consumer preferences, all of which may change rapidly and as a result of factors outside of our control. Our brands could be adversely affected by the actions of other companies that damage the reputation of our industry as a whole, in particular in relation to the Vehicle Buying division, as several companies operate under names similar to WeBuyAnyCar’s name. As we seek to expand our operations, maintaining and increasing the awareness and perceived quality of our brands and corporate image will be important to attract and expand our vendor and buyer base. We use Internet search engines, in particular Google, to generate traffic to our websites. The purchase of keywords consists of anticipating words and terms consumers will use to search on Internet search engines and then bidding on those words and terms in the applicable search engine’s auction system. Search engines, including Google, frequently update and change the logic that determines the placement and display of results of a search, such that the purchased or algorithmic placement of links to our websites can be adversely affected. Our positioning on a search engine’s search results depends on algorithms designed by the search engine provider and are based on various criteria including, in particular, the historical level of traffic on our websites. As a result, if search engine providers change their search algorithms in a manner that is competitively disadvantageous to us, our ability to generate traffic to our websites would be harmed. Furthermore, our mobile applications rely on app stores operated by third parties, in particular Apple, which make mobile applications available for download. The structure of these app stores may change and third-party operators may decide to exclude our mobile applications from their offering (e.g., if we do not agree to changes in terms and conditions), which may adversely affect the availability of our mobile applications. These operators may also charge us fees to list our mobile applications for download, which could adversely affect our margins or result in us discontinuing to offer our mobile applications through third-party app stores. We will continue to invest in, and devote resources to, advertising and marketing, as well as other efforts to preserve and enhance customer awareness of our brands. In particular, we expect to spend significant amounts on television, radio and Internet advertising to support WeBuyAnyCar, which is a purely customer brand. There can be no assurance, however, that our advertising campaigns will successfully maintain or enhance customer awareness of our brands. Advertising campaigns may be ineffective and may even have adverse effects on website traffic and brand perception as a result of factors potentially out of our control, such as changes in consumer preferences and regulatory reforms impacting advertising and marketing rules. Even if we are successful in our branding efforts, significant costs are incurred in order to develop, deploy and update our advertising campaigns, and as a result our efforts may not be cost-effective because, among others, assumptions regarding required customer acquisition costs and resulting revenue prove to be incorrect. In addition, we cannot guarantee that our current marketing channels will continue to be effective, permissible and generally available to us in the future. For television marketing, the program during which we broadcast our commercials may not achieve the anticipated number of viewers. For our online marketing, the relevant partners may be unable to deliver the anticipated traffic to our website and mobile applications. In particular, the popularity of social media channels tends to fluctuate, making it difficult to predict which channels are best suited to reach a mass audience. Moreover, any negative publicity may be accelerated through social media (e.g., Facebook, Instagram and Twitter) due to its immediacy and accessibility as a means of communication. Social media and websites immediately publish posts from users, often without filters or checks on the accuracy of the content posted. New and existing customers value readily available information concerning digital offerings and often act on such posts without further investigation or authentication. Allegations against us may be posted on social media, in Internet chat rooms or on blogs or websites by anyone on an anonymous basis. Any negative publicity, even if factually incorrect or based on isolated incidents, or the failure to maintain or enhance customer awareness of our brands and generate demand in a cost-effective manner could damage our reputation, diminish the strength of our brands, undermine the trust and credibility we have established, have a negative impact on our ability to attract new or retain existing customers and require us to spend significant time and money to address such negative publicity.

    Title: We may not be able to effectively communicate with our customers through email and other messages.
    Text: We use newsletters (e.g., emails) as a free marketing tool to promote our digital and physical offering, website and mobile applications. Our emails may, however, be shown as “spam”or given a lower priority, which could reduce the likelihood of addresses opening or responding positively to them. Actions by third parties to block, impose restrictions on, or charge for the delivery of, emails and other messages, as well as legal or regulatory changes limiting our right to send such messages or imposing additional requirements, could impair our ability to communicate with customers. If we are not able to use unpaid marketing tools in the form of emails or other messages efficiently, this could impair our marketing efforts or make them more expensive if we have to increase spending on paid marketing channels. ----- Furthermore, malfunctions of our email and messaging services could result in erroneous messages being sent and customers no longer wanting to receive any messages from us. Furthermore, our process to obtain consent from visitors to our website and users of our mobile applications to receive newsletters and other messages from us and to allow us to use their data may be insufficient or invalid or become so as result of regulatory or legislative changes. As a result, such individuals or third parties may accuse us of sending unsolicited advertisements and other messages, which could result in claims or regulatory action being brought against us.

    Title: Dissatisfaction with our customer service could prevent us from expanding our business as intended.
    Text: To provide customer service, we communicate via email and through our telephone hotlines. The satisfaction of our customers depends in particular on the effectiveness of our customer service, in particular our ability to deal with complaints (e.g., with respect to the quality of used vehicles, technical problems, payment and shipping, defects and invoicing) in a timely and satisfying manner. Any unsatisfactory response or lack of responsiveness (e.g., due to interruptions of our hotlines) could reduce customer satisfaction and loyalty and therefore adversely affect our revenue and profitability.

    Title: We are exposed to risks associated with currency fluctuations.
    Text: We report our results in pound sterling, and pound sterling is also our functional currency. However, we conduct operations in the UK and continental Europe, as a result of which approximately 11% of our revenue in the fiscal year 2021 was denominated in currencies other than pound sterling, with the significant majority of this denominated in euro. Our results of operations may therefore be affected by both the transaction and translation effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations when we incur costs or earn revenue in a currency other than the pound sterling. For example, because we report in pound sterling, our consolidated results would be adversely affected by the depreciation of the euro relative to the pound sterling, as this would result in reduced euro-denominated earnings, an effect which could increase were our European operations to expand, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we are subject to additional taxation as a result of any foreign exchange gain arising in respect of the interest on our euro-denominated indebtedness, which could similarly have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.

    Title: Environmental, health and safety risks could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.
    Text: We operate from multiple locations across the UK and continental Europe. Large numbers of vehicles are stored and prepared for sale at these sites, and during that time releases of fuel, motor oil and other materials may occur. In addition, members of the public and our employees come into close contact with vehicles moving on or around our sites. Furthermore, our employed and contracted drivers collect and deliver large numbers of vehicles across both the UK and continental Europe and our fleet of vehicle transporters carries large numbers of vehicles annually. Consequently, our operations are subject to various environmental and health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing the emission and discharge of pollutants into the air and water, the generation, treatment, storage and release of hazardous materials and wastes and the investigation and remediation of contamination, as well as regulations requiring adequate precautions to prevent injuries arising from collisions and impacts with vehicles moving within our locations and on public roads. For example, governments increasingly introduce low emission zones in certain geographical areas, where the most polluting vehicles are regulated and vehicles with higher emissions, including vehicles in support of the Automotive Services division, cannot enter, thereby limiting our operations. We may incur expenditures relating to accidents causing injury to individuals, releases of hazardous materials, investigative, remedial or corrective actions, claims by third parties and other environmental issues, and such expenditures, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. Our failure to comply with current or future environmental, health or safety laws or to obtain and comply with permits required under such laws, could also subject us to significant liability or require costly investigative, remedial or corrective actions, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.

    Title: Failure to attract and retain skilled technical employees and management personnel could harm our business.
    Text: Our success is in part driven by the skills, experience and efforts of our management team and by the efforts, ability and experience of key members of our management staff. The members of our senior management team have extensive experience in the industry in which we operate and have skills that are critical to the ----- operation of our business, including their relationships with, and understanding of the requirements of, the relevant regulatory authorities in the industry in which we operate. We have implemented policies and remuneration designed to retain and properly incentivize management; however, there can be no guarantee that we will be able to attract and retain qualified candidates to replace or succeed members of senior management, should the need arise. The loss of services of any of our management staff could significantly weaken our management expertise and our ability to deliver our services efficiently and effectively, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. Because we operate in a rapidly changing and increasingly digitalized market, our success also depends to a significant extent upon our ability to identify, attract, retain and motivate highly skilled and qualified technical personnel. Our employees have specialized knowledge that is in high demand, and competition for suitably qualified individuals with the relevant technical expertise in our industry and in the locations in which we operate is intense and may further increase as more vehicle auction companies in the UK and continental Europe shift their operating model towards an online business in response to the COVID 19 pandemic. We have a dedicated team of data scientists and have been able to utilize our data pool to develop highly accurate pricing capabilities based on age, mileage and condition, which permit us to maximize margins in real time. If we are unable to identify, attract, develop, motivate, adequately compensate and retain well-qualified and engaged personnel, or if existing highly skilled and specialized personnel leave us and successors or adequate replacements are not readily available, we may not be able to manage our operations effectively, which could cause us to suffer delays in new service offerings, experience difficulty complying with applicable requirements or otherwise fail to satisfy our customers’ demands, which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The difficulties in identifying, attracting and retaining suitable management personnel and employees are exacerbated as a result of Brexit and free movement complications in relation thereto, which make travel between the UK and continental Europe more difficult. In addition, we bear the risk that our key management and key personnel becomes infected with COVID 19, and the measures adopted in response to the COVID 19 pandemic could make the integration of newly hired personnel more challenging. See “—The COVID 19 _pandemic has had, and will continue to have, a significant adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition, operating results and liquidity, and the ultimate outcome of the COVID 19 pandemic is uncertain.”_

    Title: We are subject to a substantial number of non-terminable long-term leases.
    Text: We lease the majority of our properties, primarily comprising properties in the UK, pursuant to long-term leases. These leases do not include break clauses. As a result, if we ceased operations at properties which we could not subsequently sublet, we would continue to incur significant lease payments on these properties. In addition, as we continue to shift our operations towards a fully digital business model, we may be required to adapt the use of some or all of our properties. We may also decide to dispose of certain of our properties or may seek to terminate certain of our leases. Similarly, if and when business operations resume and return to pre-pandemic levels (see “—The COVID 19 pandemic has had, and will continue to have, a significant adverse _effect on our business, operations, financial condition, operating results and liquidity, and the ultimate outcome of the COVID 19 pandemic is uncertain”), we may also seek changes to our overall composition of portfolio of_ properties, or the related use thereof. Moreover, the current use of our properties may not necessarily be appropriate or cost efficient for future operations. However, there can be no guarantee that it will be legally permissible to change the use of our properties at such time or that we will be able to dispose of properties on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Similarly, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to renegotiate long-term leases, especially if we were to seek the termination of a lease that does not include a break clause.

    Title: We use standardized documents, contracts and terms and conditions, which may adversely affect our operations if any agreement or clause were held to be invalid.
    Text: We maintain relationships with a large number of vendors and buyers and, in this context, we regularly use standardized terms and conditions, in particular in relation to the terms and conditions of sale and purchase on our remarketing platforms and the terms and conditions applicable to WeBuyAnyCar customers. Standardized terms and conditions have to comply with the statutory laws on general terms and conditions in the different jurisdictions in which we operate, which means that in many jurisdictions they are subject to intense scrutiny by the courts. The standard is even stricter if such terms and conditions are used vis-à-vis private consumers, such as in our WeBuyAnyCar business. If standardized documents, contracts, or terms and conditions we use contain provisions which are interpreted in a manner disadvantageous to us, or if any clauses are held to be invalid and thus replaced by statutory provisions which are disadvantageous to us, a large number of our contractual relationships could be affected. This could provide our counterparties with ----- unexpected legal rights and remedies (e.g., withdrawal rights), cause us to incur unexpected expenses and prevent us from operating our business as currently operated. In some cases, courts may even determine that our standardized terms and conditions are generally invalid, and as a result we may not have entered into a valid contractual relationship with the relevant counterparty.

Does the text mention that the company is exposed to risks associated with cyclical products?

    Title: We have several defined contribution pension schemes in certain continental European countries as well as two defined benefit pension plans in the UK, some of which are in deficit.
    Text: We participate in several defined contribution pension schemes in the UK and certain continental European countries as well as two defined benefit pension plans in the UK. Our cash funding obligations are set in accordance with applicable pension legislation, assessed on a triennial basis and required to be agreed between us and independent trustees. Our cash funding obligations are further subject to increases in life expectancy. Our total contribution to these defined contribution schemes in the 52-week period ended March 28, 2021 was £6.4 million. We cannot guarantee that our future cash contributions will not undermine our capacity to satisfy our debt obligations, including the Notes. In addition, the two defined benefit pension plans in the UK are in deficit. As of March 28, 2021, the two defined benefit pension plans in the UK had a deficit of £12.4 million (2020: £15.1 million). Plan liabilities, in respect of defined benefit obligations, are calculated on a discounted basis using a discount rate which is set with reference to corporate bond yields. If the plan assets underperform such yield, then this will create a deficit. The trustees of each plan, and their advisors, carry out regular reviews of asset allocations within each plan and consider the need to switch assets in line with the investment strategies. However, the plans hold only a portion of assets as defensive assets (government and corporate bonds) and we cannot guarantee that the level of investment risk is reduced appropriately as the maturity approaches for each plan. Moreover, while we have contractual caps on the level of inflationary increases to be applied to pension obligations in order to protect the plans from extreme inflation, our pension liabilities in deferment are linked and subject to inflation. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee that an increase in inflation will not lead to an increase in our pension deficit. Furthermore, plan assets are likely to decrease following an increase in the interest rate. This is due to an increase in interest rates having the effect of a decrease in value of the defensive assets held by the plans. While such risk is partially mitigated by the measurement of plan liabilities being linked to bond yields, any decrease in interest rates has the effect of decreasing bond yields, which in turn increases plan liabilities. Accordingly, the materialization of any of these risks, if significant, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

    Text: IFRS 16 (Leases) became effective on January 1, 2019 and applies to the first full fiscal year commencing on or after that date. Accordingly, we have applied IFRS 16 since the fiscal year 2020.

Under this approach, comparative information for the 52-week period ended March 31, 2019 is not restated and, as a result, no IFRS 16 adjustments have been made to the Fiscal Year 2019 Consolidated Financial Statements. Accordingly, the financial information included in this Offering Memorandum, including the Consolidated Financial Statements, the 2020 Predecessor Financial Statements and the Fiscal Year 2020 Aggregated Financial Information, may not be comparable insofar as they relate to the application of IFRS 16 (Leases).

    Title: We have included in this Offering Memorandum certain unaudited adjusted data, which gives effect to the Refinancing Transactions, as if it had occurred on March 30, 2020, and other financial information not prepared in accordance with IFRS.
    Text: We have included in this Offering Memorandum certain unaudited adjusted data, which gives effect to the Refinancing Transactions, as if it had occurred on March 30, 2020. In addition, we have included certain non-IFRS measures, including Reported Adjusted EBITDA, IAS 17 Adjusted EBITDA, IAS 17 COVID Adjusted EBITDA, IAS 17 Pro Forma Adjusted Run Rate EBITDA, Underlying Cash CAPEX, Adjusted Operating Cash Flow, Adjusted Cash Conversion, COVID Adjusted Operating Cash Flow and COVID Adjusted Cash Conversion. The non-IFRS measures and other information (including unaudited adjusted data) included in this Offering Memorandum have been prepared for information purposes only and have not ----- been prepared in accordance with IFRS, U.S. GAAP or any other internationally accepted accounting principles or audited or reviewed in accordance with any applicable auditing standards. These non-IFRS measures and other information are not identified as accounting measures under IFRS and therefore should not be considered as alternative measures to evaluate our performance. The non-IFRS measures and other information (including unaudited adjusted data) are based on available information and certain assumptions and estimates that we believe are reasonable in the circumstances. However, these assumptions and estimates are inherently uncertain, subject to a wide variety of significant business, economic and other risks and may differ materially from our actual financial condition or results of operations. The non-IFRS measures and other information (including unaudited adjusted data) included in this Offering Memorandum are not intended to comply with the reporting requirements of the SEC and will not be subject to review by the SEC and certain measures would be prohibited from inclusion in documents furnished or filed with the SEC. Certain of these amounts have not been, and, in certain cases cannot be, audited, reviewed or verified by any independent accounting firm. We have also included certain unaudited financial information prepared in accordance with IAS 17 (Leases), which is an accounting standard that was superseded by IFRS 16. Such unaudited financial information has important limitations; in particular, it is prepared in accordance with a historic accounting standard, IAS 17 (Leases), and has not been audited. As such, it is not comparable to the audited results due to adjustments and should not be regarded as a substitute for the Consolidated Financial Statements or financial data prepared in accordance with IFRS. Moreover, some of the financial information included in this Offering Memorandum is adjusted for the estimated impact of COVID 19 and/or for certain run rate adjustments based on our most recent three months of trading. In particular, IAS 17 COVID Adjusted EBITDA and ratios derived therefrom seek to adjust IAS 17 Adjusted EBITDA for the impact of COVID 19. The adjustments made to calculate IAS 17 COVID Adjusted EBITDA are based upon available information and assumptions that we believe are reasonable in the circumstances but are included for illustrative purposes only and have not been audited. IAS 17 COVID Adjusted EBITDA is not comparable to the audited results and should not be regarded as a substitute for the Consolidated Financial Statements, which are prepared in accordance with IFRS. The adjustments relating to COVID 19 are calculated by replacing the results of operations for COVID-impacted periods with prior non-COVID impacted periods, thereby presenting the results of operations during a more normalized period of trading. For the 53-week period ended May 30, 2021, the adjustments relating to COVID 19 are calculated by replacing the results of operations for January 2021 (£4.5 million) and February 2021 (£13.2 million) with the results of operations for January 2020 (£15.9 million) and February 2020 (£21.1 million), respectively, thereby presenting the results of operations during a more normalized period of trading. For the 52-week period ended March 28, 2021, the adjustments relating to COVID 19 are calculated by replacing the results of operations for the first quarter of the fiscal year 2021 (£2.0 million) and the fourth quarter of the fiscal year 2021 (£43.9 million) with the results of operations for the first quarter of the fiscal year 2020 (£44.5 million) and the fourth quarter of the fiscal year 2020 (£66.2 million), respectively, thereby presenting the results of operations during a more normalized period of trading. For the unaudited aggregated 52-week period ended March 29, 2020, the adjustments relating to COVID 19 are calculated by adding back an amount of £11.3 million (based on management forecasts using operating results for March 2020 immediately prior to lockdowns, reflecting restrictions on operating activities due to COVID 19) and an amount of £2.7 million (representing provisions relating to bad debt and inventory). Such information and adjustments are for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to project our consolidated results of operations for any future period. Such information has not been audited, reviewed or verified and you should not place undue reliance thereon. Moreover, IAS 17 COVID Adjusted EBITDA is included for, among other periods, the 53-week period ended May 30, 2021. IAS 17 COVID Adjusted EBITDA for the 53-week period ended May 30, 2021 is calculated on the basis of IAS 17 Adjusted EBITDA for the 53-week period ended May 30, 2021 and adding adjustments relating to COVID 19 which are calculated by replacing the results of operations for January 2021 (£4.5 million) and February 2021 (£13.2 million) with the results of operations for January 2020 (£15.9 million) and February 2020 (£21.1 million), respectively. Financial information for the 53-week period ended May 30, 2021 is based on management accounts and is included for illustrative purposes only, has not been reviewed or audited and may not be reflective of the actual results for such periods and should not be regarded as a substitute for the audited consolidated financial data of the Parent or financial data prepared in accordance with IFRS. We have also included 52-week IAS 17 Pro Forma Adjusted Run Rate EBITDA as of May 30, 2021. IAS 17 Pro Forma Adjusted Run Rate EBITDA is calculated on the basis of IAS 17 COVID Adjusted EBITDA for ----- the aggregated 52-week period ended March 29, 2020 and applying additional adjustments to give effect increases in profitability and volume in our UK Vehicle Remarketing division, the our International Vehicle Remarketing division and our Vehicle Buying division, as well as the decrease in IAS 17 Adjusted EBITDA for our Automotive Services division, in the period from February 22, 2021 to May 30, 2021. IAS 17 Pro Forma Adjusted Run Rate EBITDA is included for illustrative purposes only and, as a run rate calculation giving full year effect to the most recent three month period, is likely to differ from actual results for the period. In particular, this run rate calculation does not give effect to seasonal variances or any impact of changes in longer term demand dynamics. See “Summary Financial Information—Non-IFRS Measures,” “Operating and Financial Review—COVID 19” and “Operating and Financial Review—Seasonality.” In addition, we have included certain unaudited aggregated financial information for the 52-week period ended March 29, 2020. The unaudited aggregated financial information is derived by adding together the unaudited consolidated income statement information of BCA Marketplace for the 219-day period from and including April 1, 2019 to and including November 5, 2019 and the consolidated income statement information of the Parent for the 42-week period from and including June 10, 2019 to and including March 29, 2020 (which includes the 145-day post-CA Acquisition trading result from November 6, 2019 up to and including March 29, 2020). The financial information used in presenting such information includes information for the Parent from June 10, 2019 (the date of incorporation of the Parent), which overlaps with information of BCA Marketplace from April 1, 2019. However, the Parent was formed on June 10, 2019 for the purposes of facilitating the CA Acquisition, which was consummated on November 6, 2019 and the Parent did not trade prior to November 6, 2019. Moreover, while both the Fiscal Year 2020 Consolidated Financial Statements and the 2020 Predecessor Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS, they relate to different entities that have not prepared their financial information on a consistent basis. Such unaudited aggregated financial information is included for illustrative purposes only and does not purport to represent what our income statement would have been if the CA Acquisition had occurred on April 1, 2019 and is not intended to project our consolidated results of operations for any future period. The foregoing financial data has not been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Regulation S-X of the U.S. Securities Act or any generally accepted accounting standards. None of the adjustments, estimates or run rate calculations have been audited by any independent auditors and should not be considered indicative of actual results that would have been achieved had the events for which we have made the adjustment, estimate or calculation been completed as the dates stated and do not purport to indicate our future consolidated results of operations or financial position. The actual results may differ significantly from those presented for a number of reasons, including, but not limited to, differences in assumptions used.

    Title: Our substantial leverage and debt service obligations could adversely affect our business and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations with respect to the Notes and the Guarantees.
    Text: We are, and following the issuance of the Notes, will continue to be, highly leveraged. As of March 28, 2021, after giving effect to the Refinancing Transactions, our primary financing arrangements will be the Notes, the Senior Term Loan Facility, the Revolving Credit Facility and the Second Lien Facility, and we would have had £1,760 million of Adjusted Total Debt (which excludes finance leases and borrowing under the Receivables Facility). See “Capitalization”and “Description of Other Financial Arrangements.”In addition, as of March 28, 2021, we had borrowings in an amount of £148.3 million under the Receivables Facility. The degree to which we will remain leveraged following the issuance of the Notes could have important consequences to holders of the Notes offered hereby, including, but not limited to: - making it difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the Notes; - increasing our vulnerability to, and reducing our flexibility to respond to, general adverse economic and industry conditions, including an economic downturn due to the impact of the COVID 19 pandemic; - requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of interest and amortization costs on indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of such cash flow to fund the payment of principal of indebtedness, working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, joint ventures or other general corporate purposes; - limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the competitive environment and the industry in which we operate; ----- - placing us at a competitive disadvantage as compared to our competitors, to the extent that they are not as highly leveraged; and - limiting our ability to borrow additional funds and increasing the cost of any such borrowing. Any of these or other consequences or events could have a material adverse effect on our ability to satisfy our debt obligations, including the Notes.

    Title: Despite our high level of indebtedness, we may be able to incur significant additional amounts of debt, which could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness.
    Text: We may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. Although the Indenture, the Senior Facilities Agreement and the Second Lien Facility Agreement contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions, and under certain circumstances, the amount of indebtedness that could be incurred in compliance with those restrictions could be substantial. Additionally, the Indenture, the Senior Facilities Agreement and the Second Lien Facility Agreement do not prevent us from incurring obligations that would not constitute indebtedness under these agreements.

Does the text mention that the company is exposed to risks associated with cyclical products?

    Title: The debt under the Senior Facilities Agreement and the Second Lien Facility Agreement will bear interest at a floating rate that could rise significantly, increasing our interest cost and debt and reducing our cash flow.
    Text: Borrowings under the Senior Facilities Agreement will bear interest at floating rates of interest per annum equal to the Sterling Over Night Index Average risk-free rate (“SONIA”) (in respect of pound sterling), the Euro Interbank Offered Rate (“EURIBOR”) (in respect of euro) and the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) (in respect of any other applicable currency), subject in each case to a zero floor, plus an agreed margin. Borrowings under the Second Lien Facility Agreement will bear interest at floating rates of interest per annum equal to SONIA, subject to a zero floor, plus an agreed margin. SONIA, EURIBOR and LIBOR could rise significantly in the future. Although we may enter into and maintain certain hedging arrangements designed to fix a portion of these benchmark interest rates in the future, there can be no assurances that hedging will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms. Hedging itself carries certain risks, including that we may need to pay a significant amount (including costs) to terminate any hedging arrangements. To the extent interest rates were to rise significantly, our interest expense associated with the debt under the Senior Facilities Agreement and the Second Lien Facility Agreement, to the extent not fixed by means of hedging arrangements, would correspondingly increase, thus reducing cash flow. As a consequence of regulatory reforms, the common maturities of U.S. dollar LIBOR will cease to be published as panel bank rates after June 30, 2023 (and all other LIBOR settings for all currencies will cease as panel bank rates after December 31, 2021). It is not known if or when regulatory reform may, in the future, cause EURIBOR to cease or be replaced. The U.S. dollar floating rate market is currently expected to transition to use, in place of U.S. dollar LIBOR, a floating rate equal to compounding overnight Secured Overnight Financing Rate published by the Federal Reserve in the United States plus a spread adjustment, by not later than the time that the relevant U.S. dollar LIBOR setting is to cease as a panel bank rate, although other alternative rates may also be used. These reforms may cause such benchmarks to perform differently than in the past or have other consequences which cannot be predicted. Any such consequence could have a material adverse effect on our debt linked to such a benchmark. Regulatory requirements under the EU Benchmark Regulation (particularly in relation to EURIBOR) and under the UK Benchmark Regulation (particularly in relation to LIBOR) may: (i) discourage market participants from continuing to administer or contribute to a regulated benchmark (such as EURIBOR or LIBOR); (ii) trigger changes in the rules or methodologies used for the benchmark; or (iii) lead to the disappearance of the benchmark. The scheduled cessation of the LIBOR benchmark as a panel bank rate or any proposal to cease the determination or publication of any other benchmark, changes in the manner of administration of any benchmark, or actions by regulators or law enforcement agencies could result in changes to the manner in which the relevant benchmark is determined, which could require an adjustment to the terms and conditions, or result in other consequences, in respect of any debt linked to such benchmark. Any of the above changes or any other consequential changes as a result of international, national or other proposals for reform or other initiatives may result in a sudden or prolonged increase in any affected benchmark, which could have a material adverse effect on the value of and return on any floating rate debt linked to such benchmark and on our ability to service debt that bears interest at floating rates of interest. -----

    Title: The Issuer is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Parent that does not have any revenue generating operations of its own and depends on cash from operating companies to be able to make payments on the Notes.
    Text: The Issuer is a finance subsidiary that was incorporated to facilitate the offering of the Notes and has no business operations or material assets other than its rights under the Proceeds Loan Agreement. The Issuer will be dependent upon payments under the Proceeds Loan Agreement and cash flow from our operating companies to meet its obligations under the Notes. We intend to provide funds to the Issuer in order for the Issuer to meet its obligations under the Notes principally through payments made pursuant to the Proceeds Loan Agreement, the provisions of intercompany loans, dividends and other distributions. If entities within our group do not fulfill their obligations under any such intercompany loans and do not otherwise distribute cash in order for the Issuer to make scheduled payments on the Notes, the Issuer will not have any other source of funds that would allow it to make payments to the holders of the Notes. The amount of cash available to the Issuer will depend on the profitability and cash flows of our operating companies and the ability of those companies to transfer funds under applicable law. Our operating companies, however, may not be able to, or may not be permitted under applicable law to, make distributions or advance loans, directly or indirectly, to the Issuer in order for the Issuer to make payments in respect of the Notes. In addition, the entities of our group that do not guarantee the Notes have no obligation to make payments with respect to the Notes. Applicable law may also limit the amounts that some of our subsidiaries will be permitted to pay as dividends or distributions on their equity interests, or even prevent such payments. The inability to transfer cash among entities within their respective consolidated groups may mean that even though the entities, in aggregate, may have sufficient resources to meet the obligations under the Notes, they may not be permitted to make the necessary dividends or distributions from one entity in their restricted group to another entity in their restricted group in order to make payments to the entity owing the obligations.

Does the text mention that the company is exposed to risks associated with cyclical products?

    Title: The Notes will be structurally subordinated to the liabilities of non-Guarantor subsidiaries.
    Text: Some, but not all, subsidiaries of the Parent will guarantee the Notes. For the 52-week period ended March 28, 2021, the Issuer and the Guarantors represented 68% of IAS 17 Adjusted EBITDA. Unless a company is a Guarantor, such company will not have any obligation to pay amounts due under the Notes or to make funds available for that purpose. Generally, holders of indebtedness of, and trade creditors of, non-guarantor subsidiaries, including lenders under our finance facilities and bank financing agreements, are entitled to payments of their claims from the assets of such subsidiaries before these assets are made available for distribution to any Guarantor, as a direct or indirect shareholder. Accordingly, in the event that any non-Guarantor subsidiary becomes insolvent, is liquidated, reorganized or dissolved or is otherwise wound up other than as part of a solvent transaction: - the creditors of the Issuer (including the holders of the Notes) and the Guarantors will have no right to proceed against the assets of such subsidiary; and - creditors of such non-Guarantor subsidiary, including trade creditors, will generally be entitled to payment in full from the sale or other disposal of the assets of such subsidiary before any Guarantor, as a direct or indirect shareholder, will be entitled to receive any distributions from such subsidiary. As such, the Notes and each Guarantee will be structurally subordinated to the creditors (including trade creditors) and any preferred stockholders of non-Guarantor subsidiaries.

    Title: We require a significant amount of cash to service our debt and sustain our operations. Our ability to generate sufficient cash depends on many factors beyond our control.
    Text: Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt, and to fund working capital and capital expenditures, will depend on our future operating performance and ability to generate sufficient cash. This depends, to some extent, on the success of our business strategy and on general economic, financial, competitive, market, legislative, regulatory and other factors, as well as the other factors discussed in these “Risk Factors,” many of which are beyond our control. This also depends on our cash flow cycle. If our interest payment dates coincide with periods of significant cash outflow, we may have insufficient cash to pay our obligations as they come due. We also experience seasonal fluctuations in our cash flow. Due to seasonal trends influencing both vehicle supply and demand, our revenue and operating results have varied, and likely will continue to vary, from quarter to quarter. For example, used vehicle sales in the UK tend to increase during vehicle registration plate change periods in March and September of each year. In March, in particular, new vehicle sales traditionally peak in the UK, and as a result, dealer vendors of the Vehicle Remarketing division typically experience an increase in part-exchange volumes, which has a subsequent effect of increasing ----- sales through the Marketplace. Conversely, our revenue typically decreases during the summer and in December, a seasonality pattern that is followed by sales in both the Vehicle Buying division and the Automotive Services division. Seasonality can therefore have a negative effect on our cash flow, thereby impacting our ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt, including the Notes, and to fund working capital and capital expenditures. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operating activities, that revenue growth and operating improvements will be realized or that future debt and equity financing will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debts when due, including the Notes, or to fund our other liquidity needs. In particular, the continuing economic disruption caused by the COVID 19 pandemic, and the resulting restrictions and preventive measures, have adversely affected our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operating activities. See “—Risks Relating to Our Business—The _COVID 19 pandemic has had, and will continue to have, a significant adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition, operating results and liquidity, and the ultimate outcome of the COVID 19 pandemic is uncertain” and “Operating and Financial Review—Liquidity and Capital Resources.”_ If our future cash flows from operating activities and other capital resources are insufficient to pay our obligations as they mature or to fund our liquidity needs, we may be forced to: - reduce or delay our business activities and capital expenditures; - sell assets; - obtain additional debt or equity capital; or - restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the Notes, on or before maturity. We cannot assure you that we would be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms, if at all. Any failure to make payments on the Notes on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could also harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness. In addition, the terms of our debt, including the Indenture and the terms governing the Senior Term Loan Facility, the Second Lien Facility and the Revolving Credit Facility, and any future debt, may limit our ability to pursue any of these alternatives. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and could require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business, financial condition and results of operations. There can be no assurance that any assets which we could be required to dispose of could be sold or that, if sold, the timing of such sale and the amount of proceeds realized from such sale would be acceptable.

    Title: We are subject to restrictive debt covenants that may limit our ability to finance our future operations and capital needs and to pursue business opportunities and activities.
    Text: The Indenture, the Senior Facilities Agreement and the Second Lien Facility Agreement restrict, among others, our ability to: - incur or guarantee additional indebtedness; - pay dividends or make other distributions or purchase or redeem our stock; - make investments or other restricted payments; - enter into agreements that restrict our restricted subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends; - transfer or sell assets; - engage in transactions with affiliates; - create liens on assets to secure indebtedness; - impair security interests; - merge or consolidate with or into another company; and - amend certain documents. The covenants to which we are subject could limit our ability to finance our future operations and capital needs and our ability to pursue business opportunities and activities that may be in our interest. All of these limitations are subject to significant exceptions and qualifications. For the restrictions that are included in the Indenture, see “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants.”For the restrictions that are included in the Senior Facilities Agreement and the Second Lien Facility Agreement, ----- see “Description of Other Financial Arrangements.” A breach of covenants, ratios, tests or restrictions contained in these agreements could result in an event of default under these agreements. In particular, upon the occurrence of any event of default under the Senior Facilities Agreement and the Second Lien Facility Agreement, subject to any applicable cure periods and other limitations on acceleration or enforcement, the relevant creditors could cancel the availability of the relevant facilities and elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the relevant facilities, together with accrued interest, immediately due and payable. In addition, any default under the Senior Facilities Agreement and the Second Lien Facility Agreement could lead to an event of default and acceleration under other debt instruments that contain cross-default or crossacceleration provisions, including the Indenture. If our creditors accelerate payment of amounts under the relevant facilities, we cannot assure you that our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries would be sufficient to repay in full those amounts, to satisfy all other liabilities of our subsidiaries which would be due and payable and to make payments to enable us to repay the Notes, in full or in part. In addition, if we are unable to repay those amounts, our creditors could proceed against any collateral granted to them to secure repayment of those amounts. We are also subject to the affirmative covenants contained in the Senior Facilities Agreement. In particular, we are required to comply with a financial covenant to maintain our consolidated senior secured leverage ratio for each period of twelve months ending on any financial quarter date (the first such financial quarter ending April 3, 2022) if utilizations thereunder exceed a certain threshold. See “Description of Other Financial _Arrangements—Senior Facilities Agreement.” Our ability to meet these covenants and restrictions can be_ affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that we will meet them. In addition, we are subject to certain covenants contained in the Receivables Facility Agreement, including with respect to financial covenants requiring us to meet certain EBITDA (as such term is defined in the Receivables Facility Agreement) thresholds. Our ability to satisfy the financial condition in the Receivables Facility Agreement may be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that we will satisfy such requirements. We are also subject to general undertakings contained in the Receivables Facility Agreement restricting our ability to, among others, merge with other business entities, enter into certain types of joint ventures, change our business focus, dispose of certain assets or pay dividends, in each case subject to exceptions and qualifications.

    Title: The Notes will not be initially secured by the Additional Collateral and the Additional Guarantors will not initially guarantee the Notes and rights in the Collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect security interests in the Collateral.
    Text: On the Issue Date, subject to the release of security in respect of the Existing Facilities, the Intercreditor Agreement, the operation of the Agreed Security Principles, certain perfection requirements, any Permitted Collateral Liens and certain material limitations pursuant to applicable laws, the Notes will be secured only by the Initial Collateral. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Issue Date and in any event within two business days from the Issue Date, the Notes will be secured, subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, the operation of the Agreed Security Principles, certain perfection requirements, any Permitted Collateral Liens and certain material limitations pursuant to applicable laws, by the Post-Closing Collateral. There can be no assurance that collateral in respect of the Existing Facilities will be released on the Issue Date and that we will be successful in procuring the Post-Closing Collateral within the time period specified, the failure of which would result in an event of default under the Indenture. In addition to the Notes, the Collateral will also secure borrowings under the Senior Term Loan Facility, the Second Lien Facility and the Revolving Credit Facility. See “Description of the Notes—Security.” Furthermore, the Additional Guarantors are only required to guarantee the Notes within two business days of the Issue Date. Under applicable law, a security interest in certain tangible and intangible assets can only be properly perfected, and its priority retained, through certain actions undertaken by the secured party and/or the grantor of the security, as applicable. The liens on the Collateral securing the Notes may not be perfected with respect to the claims under the Notes, if we fail or are unable to take the actions necessary to perfect any of these liens. We may not be able to perfect any such security interests. Any issues that we are unable to resolve in connection with the delivery and recordation of such security interests may negatively impact the value of the Collateral. Perfection of the security interests in the Collateral, especially the Post-Closing Collateral, after the Issue Date increases the risk that the liens granted by those security interests become avoided or subject to the liens of intervening creditors or intervening or existing liens. Any failure to perfect any security interest in the Collateral may also result in the invalidity or the lack of effectiveness of the relevant security interest or adversely affect the priority of such security interest in favor of the Notes against third parties, including a ----- trustee in bankruptcy and other creditors who claim a security interest in the same Collateral. The Trustee and the Security Agent will not be under any obligation or responsibility to take any steps or action to perfect, or ensure the perfection of, any such liens.

    Title: The Notes are secured only to the extent of the value of the Collateral that has been granted or will be granted as security for the Notes and the Guarantees, and such security may not be sufficient to satisfy the obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees.
    Text: If there is an event of default on the Notes, the holders of the Notes will be secured only by the Collateral. See “Description of the Notes—Security—The Collateral.” There is no guarantee that the value of the Collateral will be sufficient to enable the Issuer to satisfy its obligations under the Notes. There is no requirement to provide funds to enhance the value of the Collateral if it is insufficient. The proceeds of any sale of the Collateral following an event of default with respect to the Notes may not be sufficient to satisfy, and may be substantially less than, amounts due on the Notes. The amount of proceeds realized upon the enforcement of the security interests over the Collateral or in the event of liquidation will depend upon many factors, including, among others, general market and economic conditions, the condition of the market for the Collateral, the ability to sell Collateral in an orderly sale, the fair market value of the Collateral, the timing and manner of the sale, whether or not our business is sold as a going concern, the jurisdiction in which the enforcement action or sale is completed, the ability to readily liquidate the Collateral, the availability of buyers and the condition of the Collateral and exchange rates. Further, there may not be any buyer willing and able to purchase our business as a going concern, or willing to buy a significant portion of its assets in the event of an enforcement action. The book value of the Collateral should not be relied on as a measure of realizable value for such assets. Portions of the Collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. By its nature, some or all of the Collateral may not have a readily ascertainable market value or may not be saleable or, if saleable, there may be substantial delays in its disposal. To the extent that liens, security interests and other rights granted to other parties encumber assets owned by the Issuer or the Guarantors, those parties have or may exercise rights and remedies with respect to the property subject to their liens, security interests or other rights that could adversely affect the value of that Collateral and the ability of the Security Agent, the Trustee or holders of the Notes to realize or enforce that Collateral. If the proceeds of any sale of Collateral are not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Notes, investors (to the extent not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the Collateral) would have only an unsecured claim against the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ remaining assets. Each of these factors or any challenge to the validity of the Collateral or the Intercreditor Agreement could reduce the proceeds realized upon enforcement of the Collateral. In addition, there can be no assurance that the Collateral could be sold in a timely manner, or at all. Proceeds from enforcement sales of capital stock and assets that are part of the Collateral must be applied to repay on a pari passu basis the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantor under the Indenture and the Notes as well as borrowings under the Senior Term Loan Facility, the Second Lien Facility, the Revolving Credit Facility, certain hedging obligations, if any, and any other indebtedness of the Issuer and the Guarantors permitted to be incurred and secured by the Collateral pursuant to the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement. In addition, the Indenture allows incurrence of certain additional permitted debt in the future that is secured by the Collateral on a priority or pari passu basis. The incurrence of any additional debt secured by the Collateral would reduce amounts payable to you from the proceeds of any sale of the Collateral. To the extent that other first-priority security interests, pre-existing liens, liens permitted under the Indenture, the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Second Lien Facility Agreement and other rights encumber the Collateral securing the Notes, the parties may have or may exercise rights and remedies with respect to the Collateral that could adversely affect the value of the Collateral and the ability of the Security Agent to realize or foreclose on the Collateral.

    Title: It may be difficult to realize the value of the Collateral securing the Notes.
    Text: The Collateral securing the Notes is subject to any and all exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections permitted under the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement. The existence of any such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections could adversely affect the value of the Collateral securing the Notes, as well as the ability of the Security Agent to realize or foreclose on such Collateral. Furthermore, the security interests can be affected by a variety of factors, including, among others, the timely satisfaction of perfection requirements, statutory liens or re-characterization under the laws of certain jurisdictions. In addition, the laws, regulations or other governmental measures introduced in response ----- to the COVID 19 pandemic may have the effect of imposing a moratorium on or otherwise delaying or limiting the ability to enforce or pursue certain remedies in respect of the Collateral. The security interests of the Security Agent are subject to practical problems generally associated with the realization of security interests such as the Collateral. For example, the Security Agent may need to obtain the consent of a third party to enforce a security interest. We cannot assure you that the Security Agent will be able to obtain any such consents. We also cannot assure you that the consents of any third parties will be given when required to facilitate a foreclosure on such assets. Accordingly, the Security Agent may not have the ability to foreclose upon those assets, and the value of the Collateral may significantly decrease. In addition, the Security Agent, on behalf of the holders of the Notes, may have difficulty enforcing or be entirely unable to enforce rights in the Collateral in competition with third parties, including a trustee in bankruptcy and other creditors who claim a security interest in, and/or priority with respect to, the same Collateral. See “Certain Insolvency and Local Law Limitations.”

    Title: The Issuer and the Guarantors have control over the Collateral securing the Notes, and the sale of particular assets could reduce the pool of assets securing the Notes.
    Text: The Security Documents allow the Issuer and the Guarantors to remain in possession of, retain exclusive control over, freely operate, and collect, invest and dispose of any income from the Collateral securing the Notes. Subject to the Security Documents, so long as no default or event of default under the Indenture or a continuing acceleration event under the Senior Facilities Agreement and the Second Lien Facility Agreement would result therefrom, the Issuer and the Guarantors may, among others, without any release or consent by the Security Agent, conduct ordinary course activities with respect to the Collateral, such as selling, factoring, abandoning or otherwise disposing of Collateral and making ordinary course cash payments, including repayments of indebtedness.

    Title: The security interests in the Collateral are granted to the Security Agent rather than directly to the holders of the Notes. The ability of the Security Agent to enforce certain of the Collateral may be restricted by local law.
    Text: The security interests in the Collateral that secure the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes and the obligations of the Guarantors under the Guarantees are not granted directly to the holders of the Notes but are granted only in favor of the Security Agent. The Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement provide that only the Security Agent has the right to enforce the Security Documents. As a consequence, holders of the Notes will not have direct security interests and will not be entitled to take enforcement action in respect of the Collateral securing the Notes, except through the Trustee, who will (subject to the provisions of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement) provide instructions to the Security Agent in respect of the Collateral.

    Title: The incurrence of permitted debt in the future may create or restart hardening periods.
    Text: The granting of shared security interests to secure future indebtedness permitted to be secured by the Collateral may restart or reopen hardening periods (i.e. the periods of time following the granting of security interests during which such security interests may be challenged in accordance with the laws applicable in England and Wales and Jersey), as the Indenture permits the release and retaking of security granted in favor of the Notes in certain circumstances, including in connection with the incurrence of future indebtedness. The applicable hardening periods for these new security interests can run from the moment each new security interest has been granted or perfected. At each time, if the security interest granted or perfected were to be enforced before the end of the respective hardening period applicable in such jurisdiction, it may be declared void or ineffective and it may not be possible to enforce such security interest. The same rights also apply in connection with the accession of subsidiaries as additional Guarantors to the Notes and the granting of security interests over their respective assets and equity interests for the benefit of holders of the Notes.

    Title: Each Guarantee is subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability.
    Text: Each Guarantee provides the holders of the Notes with a direct claim against the relevant Guarantor. However, the Indenture provides that each Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed by the relevant Guarantor without rendering the relevant Guarantee, as it relates to that Guarantor, voidable or otherwise ineffective or limited under applicable law, and enforcement of each Guarantee would be subject to certain generally available defenses. See “Certain Insolvency and Local Law _Limitations.”_ ----- Enforcement of any of the Guarantees against any Guarantor will be subject to certain defenses available to Guarantors in the relevant jurisdiction. Although laws differ among these jurisdictions, these laws and defenses generally include those that relate to corporate purpose or benefit, fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, insolvency or bankruptcy challenges, financial assistance, preservation of share capital, thin capitalization, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally. If one or more of these laws and defenses are applicable, a Guarantor may have no liability or decreased liability under its Guarantee depending on the amounts of its other obligations and applicable law. Limitations on the enforceability of judgments obtained in New York courts in such jurisdictions could limit the enforceability of any Guarantee against any Guarantor. In addition, the laws, regulations or other governmental measures introduced in response to the COVID 19 pandemic may have the effect of imposing a moratorium on or otherwise delaying or limiting the ability to enforce or pursue certain remedies in respect of the Guarantees. Although laws differ among various jurisdictions, in general, under bankruptcy or insolvency law and other laws, a court could (i) avoid or invalidate all or a portion of a Guarantor’s obligations under its Guarantee, (ii) direct that the holders of the Notes return any amounts paid under a Guarantee to the relevant Guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of the Guarantor’s creditors or (iii) take other action that is detrimental to you, typically if the court found that: - the relevant Guarantee was incurred with actual intent to give preference to one creditor over another, hinder, delay or defraud creditors or shareholders of the Guarantor or, in certain jurisdictions, when the granting of the Guarantee has the effect of giving a creditor a preference or when the recipient was aware that the Guarantor was insolvent when it granted the relevant Guarantee; - the Guarantor did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value or corporate benefit for the relevant Guarantee and the Guarantor was (i) insolvent or rendered insolvent because of the relevant Guarantee, (ii) undercapitalized or became undercapitalized because of the relevant Guarantee or (iii) intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, indebtedness beyond its ability to pay at maturity; - the relevant Guarantee was held to exceed the corporate objects of the Guarantor or not to be in the best interests or for the corporate benefit of the Guarantor; or - the amount paid or payable under the relevant Guarantee was in excess of the maximum amount permitted under applicable law. These or similar laws may also apply to any future guarantee granted by any of our subsidiaries pursuant to the Indenture. We cannot assure you which standard a court would apply in determining whether a Guarantor was insolvent at the relevant time or that, regardless of method of valuation, a court would not determine that a Guarantor was insolvent on that date, or a that a court would not determine, regardless of whether or not a Guarantor was insolvent on the date its Guarantee was issued, that payments to holders of the Notes constituted preferences, fraudulent transfers or conveyances or improper corporate distribution on other grounds, or that a court would not otherwise set aside such Guarantee. The liability of each Guarantor under its Guarantee will be limited to the amount that will result in such Guarantee not constituting a preference, fraudulent transfer or conveyance, improper corporate distribution on other grounds or otherwise being set aside. However, there can be no assurance as to what standard a court will apply in making a determination of the maximum liability of each Guarantor. There is a possibility that the entire Guarantee may be set aside, in which case the entire liability may be extinguished. If a court were to decide that a Guarantee was a preference, fraudulent transfer or conveyance, improper corporate distribution on other grounds and voided such Guarantee, or held it unenforceable for any other reason, you may cease to have any claim in respect of the relevant Guarantor and would be a creditor solely of the Issuer and, if applicable, of any other Guarantor under the relevant Guarantee which remains valid and enforceable. In the event that any Guarantee is invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, or to the extent the agreed limitation of the Guarantee obligations apply, the Notes would be effectively subordinated to all liabilities of the applicable Guarantor, and if we cannot satisfy our obligations under the Notes or any Guarantee is found to be a preference, fraudulent transfer or conveyance, improper corporate distribution on other grounds or is otherwise set aside, we cannot assure you that we can ever repay in full any amounts outstanding under the Notes. -----

    Title: There are circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the Notes under which the Collateral securing the Notes will be released automatically and under which the Guarantees will be released automatically, without your consent or the consent of the Trustee.
    Text: Under various circumstances, Collateral securing the Notes will be released automatically, including: - upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations on the Notes issued under the Indenture or discharge or defeasance thereof; - upon release of a Guarantee (with respect to the liens securing such Guarantee granted by such Guarantor); - in connection with any disposition of Collateral to any Person; provided that if the Collateral is disposed to the Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary, the relevant Collateral becomes immediately subject to a substantially equivalent lien in favor of the Security Agent securing the Notes (but excluding any transaction subject to “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation—The Issuer and the Parent”); _provided, further, that, in each case, such disposition is permitted by the Indenture;_ - if the Parent designates any Subsidiary Guarantor to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture, the release of the property, assets and Capital Stock of such Unrestricted Subsidiary (as such terms are defined in “Description of the Notes—Certain Definitions); - in connection with certain enforcement actions taken by the creditors under certain of our secured indebtedness as provided under the Intercreditor Agreement, or otherwise in compliance with the Intercreditor Agreement; - as may be permitted by the covenant described under “Description of _the Notes—Certain _Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest;”_ - in connection with an IPO Pushdown (as defined in “Description of the Notes—Certain Definitions), as specified in the Indenture; and - in order to effectuate a merger, consolidation, conveyance or transfer conducted in compliance with the covenant described under “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation.” In addition, under various circumstances, the Guarantees will be released automatically, including: - in the case of a Subsidiary Guarantee only, a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of capital stock of the relevant Guarantor or of a holding company thereof, such that such Guarantor ceases to be a Restricted Subsidiary, or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of the relevant Guarantor (other than to the Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary), in each case in a transaction otherwise permitted by the Indenture; - in the case of a Subsidiary Guarantee only, the designation in accordance with the Indenture of the relevant Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary; - defeasance or discharge of the Notes, as provided in “Description of the Notes—Defeasance” and “Description of the Notes—Satisfaction and Discharge”; - in the case of a Subsidiary Guarantee only (other than a Subsidiary Guarantee issued on the Issue Date), to the extent that the relevant Guarantor becomes a Guarantor solely due to the operation of the first paragraph of the covenant described under “Description of the Notes—Additional Guarantees and _Collateral,” upon the release of the relevant guarantee or discharge of indebtedness referred to in such_ paragraph; - in the case of any Guarantee given by any parent of the IPO Pushdown Entity, pursuant to the provisions described under Description of the Notes—IPO Pushdown;” - upon full payment of all obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under the Indenture and the Notes; or - in connection with certain enforcement actions pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement.

    Title: English and Jersey insolvency laws may provide you with less protection than bankruptcy laws of other jurisdictions you are familiar with.
    Text: The Issuer and certain entities of our group, including the Parent and most of the other Guarantors, are incorporated under the laws of England and Wales. Accordingly, insolvency proceedings with respect to any ----- of those entities would be likely to proceed under, and be governed by, English insolvency law. In addition, H.I.J. Limited is incorporated under the laws of Jersey. Accordingly, insolvency proceedings with respect to such entity would be likely to proceed under, and be governed by, the laws of Jersey. English or Jersey insolvency laws are not identical to, and insolvency outcomes may vary from, the laws of the United States or other jurisdictions with which investors are familiar. In the event that any one or more of the Issuer or the Guarantors experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of insolvency or similar proceedings or whether English/Jersey insolvency laws would be favorable to your interests. In the event that any one or more of the Issuer, the Guarantors or any future guarantors, if any, were to experience financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. Any Guarantees and Collateral provided by entities organized in jurisdictions not discussed in this Offering Memorandum are also subject to material limitations pursuant to their terms, by statute or otherwise. Any enforcement of the Guarantees or security interests after bankruptcy or an insolvency event in such other jurisdictions will be subject to the insolvency laws of the relevant entity’s jurisdiction of organization or other jurisdictions. The insolvency and other laws of each of these jurisdictions may be materially different from, or in conflict with, each other, including in the areas of rights of secured and other creditors, the ability to void preferential transfer, priority of governmental and other creditors, ability to obtain post-petition interest and duration of the proceeding. The application of these laws, or any conflict among them, could call into question whether any particular jurisdiction’s laws should apply, adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights under the Guarantees or the Collateral in these jurisdictions and limit any amounts that you may receive.

    Title: Upon an IPO Pushdown, certain Guarantees and Collateral may be released, any retaken Collateral may be subject to hardening periods, and U.S. holders may have U.S. federal income tax consequences.
    Text: Under certain circumstances, we may undertake an IPO Pushdown (as defined under “Description of the _Notes—IPO Pushdown”). Upon consummation of the IPO Pushdown, references to the Parent and its_ restricted subsidiaries (and all related provisions) in the Indenture shall apply only to the IPO Pushdown Entity (as defined under “Description of the Notes—IPO Pushdown”) and its restricted subsidiaries from time to time, although the Issuer shall remain the same entity. Upon such substitution, each Holding Company (as defined under “Description of the Notes”) of the IPO Pushdown Entity will be irrevocably and unconditionally released from all obligations under the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement and any Guarantees or security granted by such Holding Company in respect of the Indenture and the Notes will be released. In such a case, new security documents in respect of collateral to be retaken and that will remain in place following an IPO Pushdown may need to be executed and be subject to new hardening periods. In addition, the IPO Pushdown may result in a deemed exchange of the Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes, depending upon the specific circumstances of the IPO Pushdown, and may have tax consequences for U.S. holders, including recognition of gain or loss on such deemed exchange. See “Tax Considerations— _Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences—IPO Pushdown.”_

    Title: We may not be able to obtain the funds required to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control.
    Text: The Indenture contains provisions relating to certain events constituting a Change of Control (as defined under “Description of the Notes—Change of Control”). Upon the occurrence of a change of control, we will be required to offer to repurchase all outstanding Notes at a price equal to 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to the date of repurchase. If a change of control were to occur, we cannot assure you that we would have sufficient funds available at such time, or that we would have sufficient funds to provide to the Issuer to pay the purchase price of the outstanding Notes or that the restrictions in the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Second Lien Facility Agreement or our other then-existing contractual obligations would allow us to make such required repurchases. A change of control may result in a mandatory prepayment of the Revolving Credit Facility and a right to require repayment of outstanding loans under the Senior Term Loan Facility and the Second Lien Facility. The exercise of the right of holders of the Notes to require the repurchase of the Notes upon a change of control could cause a default under our debt documents, even if the change of control itself does not. The ability of the Issuer to receive cash from entities of our group to allow it to pay cash to the holders of the Notes, following the occurrence of a change of control, may be limited by our then-existing financial resources. Sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. If an event constituting a change of control occurs at a time when we are prohibited from providing funds to the ----- Issuer for the purpose of repurchasing the Notes, we may seek the consent of the lenders under such indebtedness to the purchase of the Notes or may attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If such a consent to repay such borrowings is not obtained, the Issuer will remain prohibited from repurchasing any Notes. In addition, we cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain third-party financing to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition or make an offer to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control. Any failure by the Issuer to offer to purchase the Notes would constitute a default under the Indenture, which would, in turn, constitute a default under the Senior Facilities Agreement and the Second Lien Facility Agreement. See “Description of the Notes—Change of Control.” Further, if pursuant to a Change of Control Offer, holders of not less than 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes, the Indenture will permit the Issuer, at its option, to redeem the remaining outstanding Notes at a price of 101% of the principal amount of such Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest. As a consequence, holders of the Notes may be required to surrender the Notes against their will at a price equivalent to that paid to tendering holders and may not receive the return expected. The change of control provision contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection in the event of certain important corporate events, including a reorganization, restructuring, merger or other similar transaction involving us that may adversely affect you, because such corporate events may not involve a shift in voting power or beneficial ownership or, even if they do, may not constitute a Change of Control (as defined under “Description of the Notes—Change of Control”). Additionally, there are certain exceptions to the definition of “Change of Control”which allow changes in the ownership of the Issuer if certain conditions are satisfied, including if a specified consolidated total net leverage ratio is not exceeded in connection with such Change of Control on one occasion. Except as described under “Description of the Notes—Change of _Control,” the Indenture does not contain provisions that would require the Issuer to offer to repurchase or_ redeem the Notes in the event of a reorganization, restructuring, merger, recapitalization or similar transaction. In the event the Parent is sold to a new investor, whether or not such sale constitutes a change of control under the Indenture, no assurance can be given that any such investor will continue to implement our current business and financial strategy. See “Description of the Notes—Change of Control” and “Description of the _Notes—Certain Definitions—Specified Change of Control Event.”_ The definition of “Change of Control”in the Indenture includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Parent and its restricted subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any person. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances, there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of all or substantially all of the Parent’s and its restricted subsidiaries’ assets, taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a change of control has occurred and whether the Issuer is required to make an offer to repurchase the Notes.

    Text: The Indenture will provide that, if at any time following the date of the Indenture, the Notes receive Investment Grade Status (as defined under “Description of the Notes—Certain Definitions”) and no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing, then beginning that day the following provisions of the Indenture will not apply to the Notes: “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Limitation on _Indebtedness,” “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Restricted Payments,”_ “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted _Subsidiaries,” “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock,” “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions,” “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Additional Guarantees and Collateral” and the provisions of clause (3) of the_ first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Merger and Consolidation—The Issuer and the Parent” and, in each case, any related default provision of the Indenture. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the rating assigned by any such rating agency to such Notes should subsequently decline to below “Baa3” or “BBB,” as applicable, the foregoing covenants will be reinstituted as at and from the date of such rating decline. If these covenants were to be suspended, we would be able to incur additional debt or make payments, including dividends or investments, without restrictions under the Notes which may conflict with the interests of the holders of the Notes. There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever achieve an investment grade rating or that any such rating will be maintained. -----

We are unable to determine whether such developments affecting taxation will be enacted, but if such change do occur, the Notes will be redeemable at our option.

    Title: Credit ratings may not reflect all risks, are not recommendations to buy or hold securities and may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time.
    Text: One or more independent credit rating agencies may assign credit ratings to the Notes. The credit ratings address our ability to perform our obligations under the terms of the Notes and credit risks in determining the likelihood that payments will be made when due under the Notes. The ratings may not reflect the potential impact of all risks related to the structure, market, additional risk factors discussed in this section of this Offering Memorandum entitled “Risk Factors” and other factors that may affect the value of the Notes. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal by the rating agency at any time. No assurance can be given that a credit rating will be assigned at all, or that any credit rating will remain constant for any given period of time or that a credit rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by the credit rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances in the future so warrant. A suspension, reduction or withdrawal at any time of the credit rating assigned to the Notes by one or more of the credit rating agencies may adversely affect the cost and terms and conditions of our financings and could adversely affect the value and trading of the Notes.

    Title: The Notes will initially be held in book-entry form, and therefore you must rely on the procedures of the relevant clearing systems to exercise any rights and remedies.
    Text: The Notes will initially only be issued in global certificated form and held through Euroclear and Clearstream. Interests in the global Notes will trade in book-entry form only, and Notes in definitive registered form, or definitive registered Notes, will be issued in exchange for book entry interests only in very limited circumstances. Owners of the book-entry interests will not be considered owners or holders of Notes unless and until definitive notes are issued in exchange for book-entry interests. Instead, the common depositary (or its nominee) for Euroclear and Clearstream will be the sole registered holder of the Notes in global form. Payments of principal, interest and other amounts owing on or in respect of the Notes in global form will be made to the Paying Agent, which will make payments to Euroclear and Clearstream. Thereafter, such payments will be credited to participants’ accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream that hold book-entry interests in the Notes in global form and credited by such participants to indirect participants. After payment to the common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, none of the Issuer, the Guarantors, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, any other paying agent or any registrar will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or payments of interest, principal or other amounts to Euroclear and Clearstream, or to owners of book-entry interests. Accordingly, if you own a book-entry interest in the Notes, you must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream and, if you are not a participant in Euroclear and/or Clearstream, on the procedures of the participant through which you own your interest, to exercise any rights and obligations of a holder of the Notes under the Indenture. Owners of book-entry interests will not have the direct right to act upon our solicitations for consents or requests for waivers or other actions from holders of the Notes, including enforcement of security for the Notes and the Guarantees. Instead, if you own a book-entry interest, you will be reliant on the common depositary (as registered holder of the Notes) to act on your instructions and/or will be permitted to act directly only to the extent you have received appropriate proxies to do so from Euroclear and Clearstream or, if applicable, from a participant. We cannot assure you that procedures implemented for the granting of such proxies will be sufficient to enable you to vote on any requested actions or to take any other action on a timely basis. -----

    Title: The Notes may not become, or remain, listed on the Official List of the Exchange.
    Text: Although the Issuer will agree to use its commercially reasonable efforts to have the Notes listed on the Exchange and admitted to dealing on the Official List thereof and to maintain such listing as long as the Notes are outstanding, the Issuer cannot assure you that the Notes will become or remain listed. If the Issuer cannot maintain the listing on the Exchange and the admission to dealing on the Official List thereof, or if it becomes unduly burdensome to make or maintain such listing, the Issuer may cease to make or maintain such listing on the Official List of the Exchange. Although no assurance is made as to the liquidity of the Notes as a result of listing on the Official List of the Exchange or another recognized listing exchange for comparable issuers in accordance with the Indenture, failure to be approved for listing or the delisting of the Notes from the Official List of the Exchange or another listing exchange in accordance with the Indenture may have a material adverse effect on a holder’s ability to resell Notes in the secondary market.

    Title: There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes may be limited.
    Text: We cannot assure you as to: - the liquidity of any market in the Notes; - your ability to sell your Notes; or - the prices at which you would be able to sell your Notes. Future trading prices for the Notes will depend on many factors, including, among others, prevailing interest rates, our operating results and the market for similar securities. Historically, the market for non-investment grade securities has been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to the Notes. The liquidity of a trading market for the Notes may be adversely affected by a general decline in the market for similar securities and is subject to disruptions that may cause volatility in prices. The trading market for the Notes may attract different investors and this may affect the extent to which the Notes may trade. It is possible that the market for the Notes will be subject to disruptions. Any such disruption may have a negative effect on you, as a holder of the Notes, regardless of our prospects and financial performance. As a result, there is no assurance that there will be an active trading market for the Notes. If no active trading market develops, you may not be able to resell your holding of the Notes at a fair value, if at all. Although an application will be made to the Exchange for the listing of and permission to deal in the Notes on the Official List of the Exchange, we cannot assure you that the Notes will be or remain listed. Although no assurance is made as to the liquidity of the Notes as a result of the permission to deal in the Notes on the Official List of the Exchange being granted, failure to be approved for listing or the delisting (whether or not for an alternative admission to listing on another stock exchange) of the Notes, as applicable, from the Official List of the Exchange may have a material effect on a holder’s ability to resell the Notes, as applicable, in the secondary market. In addition, the Indenture allows us to issue additional notes in the future, which could adversely impact the liquidity of the Notes. See “Description of the Notes—Additional Notes.”

    Title: The interests of the holders of the Notes and additional notes issued under the Indenture from time to time may be inconsistent.
    Text: The Notes will be issued pursuant to a single Indenture. Subject to certain restrictions, further series of additional notes may be issued under the Indenture which may have different terms in respect of currency, interest rate and certain other matters. Accordingly, holders of such additional notes may have interests that differ from the holders of other series of notes issued under the Indenture, including the Notes. However, holders of such additional notes will generally vote as a single class with holders of other series of notes issued under the Indenture, including the Notes, with respect to amendments, waivers or other modifications of the Indenture. Accordingly, to the extent any amendment, waiver or modification is approved by the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding under the Indenture (subject to the limited exceptions), all holders of Notes under the Indenture will be bound by such amendment, waiver or modification.

    Title: Additional Notes sold pursuant to Regulation S may not be fungible with existing Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
    Text: Additional Notes sold pursuant to Regulation S from time to time may be issued with the same ISIN, Common Code, CUSIP or other securities identification number as the applicable series of notes previously issued under the Indenture without being fungible with such series of notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes. ----- If you are a U.S. holder (as defined under “Tax Considerations—Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax _Consequences”) considering the purchase of Notes sold pursuant to Regulation S as part of this offering of_ Notes or in the secondary market, you should consult your tax advisors concerning the particular U.S. federal income tax consequences to you of the purchase, ownership and disposition of such Notes, including with respect to the potential issuance of additional Notes that are not fungible with the applicable series of initial Notes issued under the Indenture for U.S. federal income tax purposes, but which, nevertheless, are not capable of being separately identified. In the event Additional Notes are issued pursuant to Regulation S that bear the same ISIN, Common Code, CUSIP or other securities identification number as Notes belonging to the same series previously issued, without being fungible with such series of initial Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes, Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Notes that form part of that series, including in respect of investors that hold Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Notes on or prior to the date of issuance of such Additional Notes, will not be eligible for transfer to Book-Entry Interests in a Rule 144A Global Note, if any, representing Notes of that same series. Such a restriction could adversely impact the liquidity of sales of Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Notes. See “Book-Entry, Delivery and Form—Transfers” and _“Description of the Notes—Additional Notes.”_

The directors and executive officers of the Issuer and the Guarantors are non-residents of the United States. Although the Issuer and the Guarantors will submit to the jurisdiction of certain New York courts in connection with any action under U.S. securities laws or under the Indenture, you may be unable to effect service of process within the United States on the directors and executive officers of the Issuer and the Guarantors. In addition, because the assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors and the assets of their directors and executive officers are located outside of the United States, you may be unable to enforce against them judgments obtained in U.S. courts. Moreover, in light of recent decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court, actions of the Issuer and the Guarantors may not be subject to the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States.

    Title: Investors may face foreign exchange risks by investing in the Notes.
    Text: The Notes will be denominated and payable in pound sterling. An investment in the Notes denominated in a currency other than the currency by reference to which you measure the return on your investments will entail foreign exchange related risks due to, among others, possible significant changes in the value of the pound sterling relative to other relevant currencies because of economic, political or other factors over which we have no control. Depreciation of the pound sterling against other relevant currencies could cause a decrease in the effective yield of the Notes below their stated coupon rates and could result in a loss to you when the return on the Notes is translated into the currency by reference to which you measure the return on your investments. In addition, an investment in the Notes by U.S. investors may have significant tax consequences. See “Tax Considerations—Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences.” -----

    Title: Investors in and purchasers of the Notes may have limited or no recourse against our independent auditor.
    Text: See “Independent Auditor” for a description of the reports of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (“PwC”), our independent auditor, including language limiting their scope of responsibility in relation to their audit work. Investors in and purchasers of the Notes may have limited or no recourse against PwC. Investors in and purchasers of the Notes should understand that consistent with guidance issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, PwC’s reports included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum each states that the relevant report has been prepared for and only for the Parent’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose and that PwC will does not accept responsibility or liability in respect of the report to any party save where expressly agreed by its prior consent in writing. The SEC would not permit such limiting language to be included in a registration statement or a prospectus used in connection with an offering of securities registered under the Securities Act, or in a report filed under the Exchange Act. If a U.S. court (or any other court) were to give effect to the language set out above, the recourse that investors in and purchasers of the Notes may have against PwC based on its reports or the directors’ reports and financial statements to which they relate could be limited. The extent to which PwC may have responsibility or liability to third parties can be unclear under the laws of many jurisdictions, including the United Kingdom. The inclusion of the language referred to above, however, may limit the ability of holders of the Notes to bring any action against PwC for damages arising out of an investment in or purchase of the Notes.

    Title: The interests of our controlling shareholder may differ from the interests of the holders of the Notes.
    Text: TDR Capital indirectly beneficially owns approximately 74% of the outstanding shares of the Parent. As a result, TDR Capital is able to control matters requiring shareholder approval, including the election and removal of our directors, our corporate and management policies, potential mergers or acquisitions, payment of dividends, asset sales and other significant corporate transactions. The interests of TDR Capital may differ from yours in material respects. For example, if we encounter financial difficulties or are unable to pay our debts as they mature, the interests of TDR Capital, as ultimate majority shareholder, may be in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures, financings or other transactions that, in their judgment, could enhance their equity investment, even though such transactions might involve risks to you as a holder of the Notes. TDR Capital has no contractual obligations to fund our business and may not have sufficient liquidity to fund our business if we require additional funding. Additionally, the Indenture permits us to pay management fees, dividends or make other restricted payments under certain circumstances, and TDR Capital may have an interest in our doing so. See “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions.” Furthermore, TDR Capital and their affiliates are in the business of making investments in companies and may from time to time acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly and indirectly with us, or with which we conduct business. TDR Capital and their affiliates may also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. You should consider that the interests of these holders may differ from yours in material respects. See “Principal Shareholders” and “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions.” -----

    Title: Our business, financial condition and results of operations have been, and may continue to be, adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.
    Text: The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has had, and any possible future outbreaks could have, an adverse effect on us. The COVID-19 pandemic, and the reactions of governmental and other authorities to contain, mitigate or combat the pandemic, have severely restricted the level of economic activity around the world, have impacted, and are expected to continue to impact, our operations, and the nature, extent and duration of the impact of COVID-19 or any future disease or adverse health condition is highly uncertain and beyond our control. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the governments of many countries have taken preventative or protective actions, such as imposing lockdowns, curtailing travel, closure of schools, prohibitions of mass gatherings, mandatory remote working, and in some countries, the ability to access manufacturing facilities and office buildings. The COVID-19 pandemic has also caused significant economic dislocation in many of the countries in which we operate and sell our products, which has resulted in an unprecedented slow-down in economic activity and a related increase in unemployment. Were a recession to occur, we cannot predict the length of such recession or the short- and long-term impact it may have on the global economy or our business specifically. Resurgences or further outbreaks of COVID-19 are also likely to occur. We cannot predict when or where any further outbreaks may occur, their duration, how far into the future we may experience outbreaks nor can we predict with any certainty the impacts of such subsequent outbreaks, including the impacts of future national or local lockdowns or other measures implemented by national and/or local authorities. As of April 2021, COVID-19 outbreaks were significantly affecting many countries, including Germany and other countries in which we operate, with cases rising markedly and with new, more contagious strains of the virus emerging. Any or all such consequences may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. As a response to COVID-19, we initiated a shutdown of production at four of our production sites, Görlitz, Strödt, Bernstadt and Steinau-Ürzell beginning in April 2020. While production resumed at three of our sites in late May or early June of 2020, the downtime at the Steinau-Ürzell site continued until September 2020. The production shutdown resulted in unplanned idle costs of €16.7 million (excluding idle costs assumed in budget or outside the shutdown period). In the three months ended December 31, 2020, we significantly ramped up production to replenish depleted inventory levels. The average cost per unit increased significantly compared to normal levels in the period that our production sites were closed. We also incurred additional costs associated with stocking raw materials in March 2020 in anticipation of delays and supply chain disruptions. While we continue to monitor the situation, we do not currently envisage further disruption to our supply chain and distribution channels, and believe our inventory levels are sufficient; however, any future mandatory shutdowns, reductions in operations or other restrictions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. In addition, during the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, all of our retail stores in Europe, America and Asia have been closed at times, resulting in a significant decrease in our revenues from our Retail channel. Due 31 ----- to local government mandated “stay-at-home” orders, on March 29, 2020, we shut our two retail locations in the United States and laid off the retail staff. We also laid off certain corporate staff. We received short-time working (Kurzarbeit) compensation from the German government’s employment agency (KUG) in the amount of €6.1 million for FY 2020. Such payments are subject to a final review (Vorbehalt der Nachprüfung) of the conditions for the payments by the Federal Labor Agency. While we believe we are in compliance with these requirements, this payroll relief could be clawed back by the government in the event that these eligibility criteria are not met. In addition, even though our locations in Europe were able to reopen, we have had to close again our retail stores in certain locations as governments reintroduced lockdown measures, and we cannot predict how long such lockdown measures will last or, if lifted, if they could be reintroduced in the future. Many of our wholesale customers have also closed at times, with some rescheduling orders, resulting in deferred wholesale revenues (including distributor revenue) and requiring a build-up of inventory in order to mitigate any disruptions in our distribution channels. Despite proactive measures by us to address COVID-19 and the significant increase in revenues from our e-commerce channels during the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, our revenues in our retail was adversely affected. In the three months ended December 31, 2020, our retail sales declined by 26.0% compared to the three months ended December 31, 2019, respectively. As a precautionary matter, we also collected deposits from certain wholesale partners for potential defaults due to the COVID-19 pandemic, primarily related to our U.S. operations. Any further outbreaks of COVID-19 and related measures to contain such outbreaks could impact existing orders from customers and our ability to fulfill such orders. Although we have implemented measures to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, including disinfecting production sites and offices, purchasing face masks for our employees, actively tracking any confirmed cases of COVID-19 and performing root cause analysis, and inviting regulators to our sites to review safety protocol, these measures may not fully mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, or adequately protect against any outbreaks of COVID-19 at our production facilities. We have also incurred certain costs in connection with implementing these measures and with hiring replacement workers following the reopening of our production facilities. We have also taken steps to ensure that our manufacturing partners in Portugal are adequately protecting employees at their production sites and have performed COVID-19 audits on certain of our logistics partners, but may still be subject to business or reputation risks if such measures are inadequate. We cannot, however, predict the degree to, or the period over, which we will be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and the need to continue implementing such measures. Given evolving government policies and the emergence of new variants of COVID-19 in several countries where we operate, and despite the development of a vaccine, there may be further impacts on the economies or the consumer purchasing power of the countries where we operate. Any of the foregoing including any resulting deterioration in general economic conditions or change in consumer behavior, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition results of operations and prospects. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business, financial condition, liquidity or results of operations, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this “Risk _Factors” section.
